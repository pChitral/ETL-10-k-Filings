885725,BSX,BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORP,2012,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Executive SummaryFinancial Highlights and TrendsIn 2011, we generated net sales of $7.622 billion, as compared to $7.806 billion in 2010, a decrease of $184 million, or two percent. Our sales declined approximately $200 million as a result of the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011; offsetting this decline was the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which contributed $204 million to our net sales in 2011, as compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales decreased $182 million, or two percent, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to constant currency declines in net sales from our Interventional Cardiology division of $180 million and constant currency declines in net sales from our Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) business of $144 million. These decreases were partially offset by constant currency increases in net sales from our Endoscopy business of $69 million, net sales from our Peripheral Interventions business of $36 million, and net sales from our Neuromodulation business of $31 million, as compared to the same period in the prior year.1 In addition, our 2010 net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $120 million as a result of the 2010 U.S. CRM ship hold. Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our sales results and the 2010 U.S. CRM ship hold.Our reported net income in 2011 was $441 million, or $0.29 per share. Our reported results for 2011 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- and litigation-related charges and credits; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $577 million, or $0.38 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2011 was $1.018 billion, or $0.67 per share. Our reported net loss in 2010 was $1.065 billion, or $0.70 per share. Our reported results for 2010 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- and litigation-related charges and credits; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $2.116 billion, or $1.39 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2010 was $1.051 billion, or $0.69 per share. The following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to those adjusted results considered by management.

Our operating cash flows included approximately $300 million of litigation-related net payments in 2011, as compared to approximately $1.6 billion in 2010; in addition, in 2010 we received an acquisition-related milestone payment of $250 million. Our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth and returning value to shareholders by buying back shares of our common stock, pursuant to our share repurchase authorizations discussed in Note L - Stockholders' Equity to our 2011 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. During 2011, we used $492 million of cash generated from operations to repurchase approximately 82 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2011, we had total debt of $4.261 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $267 million and working capital of $1.298 billion. During 2011, we prepaid the remaining $1.0 billion of our term loan and paid $250 million of our senior notes at maturity. In July 2011, Fitch Ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating to BBB-, an investment-grade rating; and in February 2012, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded our corporate credit rating to Baa3, an investment-grade rating. In addition, Standard & Poor's Rating Services has maintained an investment-grade corporate credit rating for us since 2009. We believe these rating improvements reflect the strength of our product portfolio and cash flows, the reduction of our debt, and our improved financial fundamentals. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion.Business and Market OverviewCoronary Stent SystemsWe are the only company in the industry to offer a two-drug platform strategy, which we believe has enabled us to maintain our leadership position in the drug-eluting stent market. We market our next-generation internally-developed and self-manufactured PROMUS® Element™ drug-eluting stent platform in the U.S., our Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) region and certain Inter-Continental countries, including China beginning in the fourth quarter of 2011. We market our PROMUS® everolimus-eluting stent system, supplied to us by Abbott Laboratories in Japan. We expect to launch our PROMUS® Element™ stent system in Japan at or before mid-2012. We also offer our TAXUS® paclitaxel-eluting stent line, including our third-generation TAXUS® Element™ stent system in the U.S., Japan, EMEA and certain Inter-Continental countries. Our Element™ stent platform incorporates a unique platinum chromium alloy designed to offer greater radial strength and flexibility, enhanced visibility and reduced recoil, compared to older alloys. The innovative stent design improves deliverability and allows for more consistent lesion coverage and drug distribution. These product offerings demonstrate our commitment to drug-eluting stent market leadership and continued innovation. Our coronary stent system offerings also include the VeriFLEX™ (Liberté®) bare-metal coronary stent system and our third-generation OMEGA™ platinum chromium bare-metal coronary stent system. Net sales of our coronary stent systems, including bare-metal stent systems, of $1.620 billion represented approximately 21 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011. Worldwide net sales of these products decreased $50 million, or three percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed $45 million to our coronary stent system net sales in 2011, as compared to the prior year, net sales of these products decreased $95 million, or six percent. Despite continued competition and pricing pressures, we maintained our leadership position during 2011 with an estimated 35 percent share of the worldwide drug-eluting stent market. During the second quarter of 2011, one of our competitors announced plans to exit the drug-eluting stent market. Although the full impact on the market remains uncertain, we believe this 35Table of Contentspresents an opportunity for us to expand our presence in the worldwide drug-eluting stent market and the broader cardiovascular market.The following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales: Year Ended Year Ended(in millions) December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 U.S. International Total U.S. International TotalTAXUS® $281 $139 $420 $277 $223 $500PROMUS® 459 196 655 528 282 810PROMUS® Element™ 10 424 434 227 227Drug-eluting 750 759 1,509 805 732 1,537Bare-metal 32 79 111 44 89 133 $782 $838 $1,620 $849 $821 $1,670Our U.S. net sales of drug-eluting stent systems decreased $55 million, or seven percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010. The decline was due to an overall decrease in the size of the market, resulting principally from lower average selling prices driven by competitive and other pricing pressures, and lower procedural volumes. This decline was partially offset by an increase in our share of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market due largely to the launch of our third-generation TAXUS® Element™ stent system in the U.S. (commercialized as ION™) in the second quarter of 2011. We estimate that the average selling price of drug-eluting stent systems in the U.S. decreased approximately seven percent in 2011, as compared to 2010 and estimate that the number of percutaneous coronary intervention procedures performed decreased one percent in 2011, as compared to 2010. We believe that average drug-eluting stent penetration rates (a measure of the mix between bare-metal and drug-eluting stents used across procedures) in the U.S. were 77 percent during both 2011 and 2010. In addition, we believe our share of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market approximated 48 percent in 2011, as compared to 46 percent in 2010. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we received FDA approval and began launching our next-generation, internally-developed and self-manufactured PROMUS® Element™ everolimus-eluting stent platform in the U.S. Our PROMUS® Element™ stent system has significantly higher gross profit and operating profit margins as compared to our PROMUS® stent system, which is supplied to us by Abbott, based on the terms of the PROMUS® supply arrangement. We expect to fully convert our U.S. drug-eluting stent system sales to self-manufactured PROMUS® Element™ and TAXUS® stent systems during 2012. We believe that our Element™ platinum chromium stent platform, combined with our two-drug platform strategy and broad range of stent sizes, provides a competitive advantage that has allowed us to expand our leadership position in the U.S. drug-eluting stent market. Our international drug-eluting stent system net sales increased $27 million, or four percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed $41 million to our international drug-eluting stent system net sales in 2011, as compared to the prior year, net sales of our drug-eluting stent systems decreased $14 million, or two percent. Our net sales of drug-eluting stent systems in our Inter-Continental region increased $18 million, or nine percent, on a constant currency basis, in 2011, as compared to 2010, driven by sales growth in key emerging markets, including China, Brazil and India. Our net sales of drug-eluting stent systems in our EMEA region decreased $4 million, or one percent in 2011, as compared to 2010, due primarily to declines in average selling prices. Net sales of our drug-eluting stent systems in Japan decreased $28 million, or 13 percent, on a constant currency basis, in 2011, as compared to 2010, driven primarily by a loss of market share due to competitive launches. We are currently reliant on Abbott Laboratories for our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems in Japan. Our supply agreement with Abbott for everolimus-eluting stent systems extends through June 30, 2012. At present, we believe that our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems from Abbott, coupled with our current launch plans for our internally-developed and self-manufactured next-generation PROMUS® Element™ everolimus-eluting stent system in Japan, currently expected at or before mid-2012, will be sufficient to meet our customer demand.Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial end points. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or third parties, or the market’s perception of these clinical data, may adversely impact our position in, and share of, the drug-eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market.We believe that we can sustain our leadership position within the worldwide drug-eluting stent market in the foreseeable future for a variety of reasons, including:36Table of Contents•our two-drug platform strategy, including specialty stent sizes;•the broad and consistent long-term results of our TAXUS® clinical trials, and the favorable results of XIENCE V®/PROMUS®, PROMUS® Element™ and TAXUS® Element™ (ION™) stent system clinical trials to date;•the performance benefits of our current and future technology;•the strength of our pipeline of drug-eluting stent products, including our PROMUS® Element™ stent system, launched in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2011 and expected to be launched in Japan at or before mid-2012;•our overall position in the worldwide interventional medicine market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force; •the strength of our clinical, selling, marketing and manufacturing capabilities; and•our increased presence and investment in the rapidly growing emerging markets, including China and India. However, a decline in net sales from our drug-eluting stent systems could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and operating cash flows. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug-eluting stent market and our position within this market include, but are not limited to:•the impact of competitive pricing pressure on average selling prices of drug-eluting stent systems available in the market;•the impact and outcomes of on-going and future clinical results involving our or our competitors’ products, including those trials sponsored by our competitors, or perceived product performance of our or our competitors’ products;•physician and patient confidence in our current and next-generation technology;•our ability to timely and successfully launch next-generation products and technology features, including the PROMUS® Element™ stent system in Japan;•changes in drug-eluting stent penetration rates, the overall number of percutaneous coronary intervention procedures performed and the average number of stents used per procedure;•delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies;•new product launches by our competitors; and•the outcome of intellectual property litigation.During 2009, 2010 and 2011, we successfully negotiated closure of several long-standing legal matters and recently received favorable legal rulings in several other matters; however, there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation, particularly in the coronary stent market. In particular, although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with Johnson & Johnson, we continue to be involved in patent litigation with them, primarily relating to drug-eluting stent systems. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems)In addition to coronary stent systems, our Interventional Cardiology business markets balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures, as well as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging systems. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $875 million in 2011, as compared to $932 million in 2010, a decrease of $57 million, or six percent. Our U.S. net sales were $342 million in 2011, as compared to $394 million in 2010. Our international net sales of these products were $533 million in 2011, as compared to $538 million in 2010, and included a $28 million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) net sales decreased $85 million, or nine percent, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was primarily the result of competitive pricing pressures, market-wide reductions in procedural volumes and market share declines in our IVUS business. We continue to hold a strong leadership position in the PTCA balloon catheter market, with an estimated 53 percent average share of the U.S. market and 30 percent of the worldwide market in 2011. In June 2010, we launched the NC Quantum Apex™ post-dilatation balloon catheter, developed specifically to address physicians’ needs in optimizing coronary stent deployment, which has been received positively in the market and, in the second half of 2010, also launched our Apex™ pre-dilatation balloon catheter with platinum marker bands for improved radiopacity. 37Table of ContentsAs part of our strategic plan, we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, other areas and disease states, including structural heart therapy. In March 2011, as part of our priority growth initiatives, we completed the acquisition of Atritech, Inc. Atritech has developed a novel device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. The WATCHMAN® Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology, developed by Atritech, is the first device proven in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to anticoagulant drugs, and is approved for use in CE Mark countries. We expect to complete enrollment in our U.S. clinical trial by the end of 2012 and expect to receive FDA approval in 2013. We are integrating the operations of the Atritech business and are leveraging expertise from both our Electrophysiology and Interventional Cardiology divisions in the commercialization of the WATCHMAN® device.In addition, in January 2011, we completed the acquisition of Sadra Medical, Inc. Sadra is developing a fully repositionable and retrievable device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis using its Lotus™ Valve System, which consists of a stent-mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve. The low-profile delivery system and introducer sheath are designed to enable accurate positioning, repositioning and retrieval at any time prior to release of the aortic valve implant. TAVR is one of the fastest growing medical device markets. Cardiac Rhythm ManagementOur Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) division develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices including implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) systems and pacemaker systems that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities. Our product offerings include our COGNIS® cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D), our TELIGEN® ICD systems and our ALTRUA® family of pacemaker systems. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we began the U.S. launch of our next-generation line of defibrillators, INCEPTA™, ENERGEN™ and PUNCTUA™, which are among the world’s smallest and thinnest high-energy devices and deliver excellent longevity. This tiered product line includes new features designed to improve functionality, diagnostic capability and ease of use and we expect it will allow us to effectively compete in all segments of the market. Additionally, this next-generation of defibrillators includes models with our 4-SITE lead delivery system which is built off our highly reliable RELIANCE platform. We expect to launch the INGENIO™ family of pacemaker systems in EMEA and in the U.S. during the first half of 2012. This launch would represent our first new major pacemaker system technology introduction in many years and is expected to be the foundation for a series of low-voltage pacemaker launches. The INGENIO™ system includes functionality for remote patient monitoring; features for advanced heart failure diagnostics; and is expected to be compatible with MRI systems in mid-2012 in EMEA, based on our current launch plans.Worldwide net sales of our CRM products of $2.087 billion represented approximately 27 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2011. Our worldwide CRM net sales decreased $93 million, or four percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed $51 million to our 2011 CRM net sales as compared to 2010, our CRM net sales decreased $144 million, or seven percent. The following are the components of our worldwide CRM net sales: Year Ended Year Ended(in millions) December 31, 2011 December 31, 2010 U.S. International Total U.S. International TotalICD systems $949 $569 $1,518 $1,037 $562 $1,599Pacemaker systems 279 290 569 320 261 581CRM products $1,228 $859 $2,087 $1,357 $823 $2,180Our U.S. CRM net sales decreased $129 million, or 10 percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010. The reduction in our CRM net sales during 2011 reflects the impact of a contraction in the U.S. ICD market. We believe the U.S. ICD market contraction is due to a variety of factors, including physician reaction to study results published by the Journal of the American Medical Association regarding evidence-based guidelines for ICD implants, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigations into hospitals’ ICD implant practices and the expansion of Medicare recovery audits, as well as on-going physician alignment to hospitals and competitive pricing pressures. In addition, our 2010 net sales were negatively impacted by approximately $120 million as a result of not selling certain of our U.S. CRM products during portions of the first and second quarters of 2010. On March 15, 2010, we announced a ship hold and removal of our field inventory related to our ICD and CRT-D systems in the U.S. after determining that certain instances of changes in the manufacturing process related to these products were not submitted for approval to the FDA. During the second quarter of 2010, we submitted the required documentation and received clearance from the FDA for these manufacturing changes and resumed distribution of our ICD and CRT-D systems. We believe that the recent launches of our next-generation line 38Table of Contentsof defibrillators, and the expected launch of our next-generation of INGENIO™ pacemaker systems in the first half of 2012 in the U.S., will help enhance our position in the U.S. CRM market.Our international CRM net sales increased $36 million, or four percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our international CRM net sales decreased $15 million, or two percent, as compared to the prior year. Our net sales of our CRM products decreased $40 million, or seven percent, in our EMEA region, as compared to the prior year, due primarily to lower average selling prices, driven by competitive and other pricing pressures. This decrease was partially offset by a constant currency increase in net sales of $12 million, or nine percent, in our Inter-Continental region in 2011, as compared to 2010. This increase was driven by growth in sales of our pacemaker systems and the continued market acceptance of our COGNIS® CRT-D and TELIGEN® ICD systems, and our 4-SITE lead delivery system, which was launched in the fourth quarter of 2010. Our net sales of CRM products in Japan increased $13 million, or 13 percent, on a constant currency basis, as compared to the prior year. We received CE Mark approval for our INCEPTA™, ENERGEN™ and PUNCTUA™ next-generation line of defibrillators in 2011 and we plan to launch our next-generation INGENIO™ family of pacemaker systems in our EMEA and certain Inter-Continental regions in the first half of 2012. Net sales from our CRM products represent a significant source of our overall net sales. Therefore, increases or decreases in our CRM net sales could have a significant impact on our results of operations. The variables that may impact the size of the CRM market and/or our share of that market include, but are not limited to:•the on-going impact of physician alignment to hospitals, government investigations and audits of hospitals, and other market and economic conditions on the overall number of procedures performed and average selling prices;•our ability to retain and attract key members of our CRM sales force and other key CRM personnel;•the ability of CRM manufacturers to maintain the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community, the referring physician community and prospective patients in CRM technologies;•future product field actions or new physician advisories issued by us or our competitors;•our ability to timely and successfully develop and launch next-generation products and technologies worldwide; •variations in clinical results, reliability or product performance of our and our competitors’ products;•delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; and•new product launches by our competitors.EndoscopyOur Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $1.187 billion in 2011, as compared to $1.079 billion in 2010, an increase of $108 million, or 10 percent, driven by products recently introduced, expanded indications and the increased adoption of our single-use products. Our U.S. net sales of our Endoscopy products were $562 million in 2011, as compared to $541 million in 2010. Our international net sales were $625 million in 2011, as compared to $538 million in 2010, and included a $39 million favorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide Endoscopy net sales increased $69 million, or six percent, in 2011, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to higher net sales within our stent franchise, driven by our WallFlex® family of stents; in particular, the WallFlex® Biliary line, including the WallFlex® Biliary RX Fully Covered Stent, which obtained CE Mark for treatment of benign biliary strictures in the fourth quarter of 2010. Increases in our biliary device sales were also supported by growth in our Advanix™ Biliary Plastic Stent System and the Expect™ Endoscopic Ultrasound Aspiration Needle, which we launched in the U.S. and certain international markets in the second quarter of 2011. Our hemostasis franchise sales also grew based on continued adoption and utilization of our Resolution® Clip Device, an endoscopic mechanical clip designed to treat gastrointestinal bleeding.As part of our strategic plan, we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, other areas and disease states, including endoscopic pulmonary intervention. In October 2010, we completed our acquisition of Asthmatx, Inc. Asthmatx designs, manufactures and markets a less-invasive, catheter-based bronchial thermoplasty procedure for the treatment of severe persistent asthma. The Alair® Bronchial Thermoplasty System, developed by Asthmatx, has both CE Mark and FDA approval and is the first device-based asthma treatment approved by the FDA. We expect this technology to strengthen our existing offering of pulmonary devices and contribute to mid- to long-term sales growth and diversification of the Endoscopy business.Peripheral Interventions (PI)Our PI product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and vena cava filters, which are 39Table of Contentsused to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $731 million in 2011, as compared to $669 million in 2010, an increase of $62 million, or nine percent. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $310 million in 2011 and 2010. Our international net sales were $421 million in 2011, as compared to $359 million in 2010, and included a $26 million favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide PI net sales increased $36 million, or five percent in 2011, as compared to 2010, driven by growth in all three of our peripheral interventions product franchises. Growth in our PI stent systems was driven by the EPIC™ self-expanding nitinol stent system in certain international markets and the Carotid WALLSTENT® stent system in Japan. We currently expect to launch the EPIC™ stent system in the U.S. during 2012. Our Core PI franchise experienced market share growth in 2011 driven primarily by the recent launches of our next-generation Mustang™ percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon, our Coyote™ balloon catheter, a highly deliverable and ultra-low profile balloon dilatation catheter designed for a wide range of peripheral angioplasty procedures, and our Charger™ PTA Balloon Catheter, launched in the U.S. in December 2011. In addition, our interventional oncology franchise continued strong worldwide sales growth, as recently launched products, including the Renegade® HI-FLO™ Fathom® microcatheter and guidewire system and Interlock™ - 35 Fibered IDC™ Occlusion System for peripheral embolization, continue to be well received by our customers. We expect to have a number of new PI products launching throughout 2012 that we believe will drive future growth in this business.As part of our strategic plan, we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, other areas and disease states. In February 2011, we announced the acquisitions of S.I. Therapies and ReVascular Therapeutics, Inc., which add to our PI portfolio a re-entry catheter and intraluminal chronic total occlusion (CTO) crossing device, enabling endovascular treatment in cases that typically cannot be treated with standard endovascular devices. We have commenced a limited market release of our OFFROAD™ re-entry catheter system in certain international markets, and in February 2012, we launched our TRUEPATH™ intraluminal CTO device in the U.S. We expect to launch our TRUEPATH™ device in EMEA during the first half of 2012, and to expand the launch of our OFFROAD™ system in our international markets throughout 2012. We believe that offering these devices will enhance our position in assisting physicians in addressing the challenges of treating complex peripheral lesions.Urology/Women’s HealthOur Urology/Women’s Health division develops, manufactures and sells devices to treat various urological and gynecological disorders. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $498 million in 2011, as compared to $481 million in 2010, an increase of $17 million, or four percent. Our U.S. net sales were $362 million in 2011, as compared to $365 million in 2010. Our international net sales were $136 million in 2011, as compared to $116 million in 2010, and included an $8 million favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, worldwide net sales of our Urology/Women’s Health products increased $9 million in 2011, as compared to 2010.Our Urology business experienced positive growth in 2011 due to the strength of our U.S. Core Stone Management business. The 2010 launch of our Accumax® and Flexiva™ Laser Fibers drove the net sales growth in our U.S. Core Stone business. Additionally, our Stone business experienced double-digit net sales growth in our Inter-Continental region in 2011, as compared to 2010.Our Women's Health business was negatively impacted in 2011 by elective procedural softness and competitive product offerings. In addition, in July 2011, the FDA released a Public Health Notice update regarding complications related to the use of urogynecologic surgical mesh for pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence. Partially offsetting these negative impacts were increased market share and sales of our Genesys Hydro ThermAblator® (HTA) system, a next-generation endometrial ablation system designed to ablate the endometrial lining of the uterus in premenopausal women with menorrhagia. The Genesys HTA System features a smaller and lighter console, simplified set-up requirements, and an enhanced graphic user interface and is designed to improve operating performance.NeuromodulationOur worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products were $336 million in 2011, as compared to $304 million in 2010, an increase of $32 million, or 11 percent. Our U.S. net sales of Neuromodulation products were $317 million in 2011, as compared to $288 million in 2010, and our international net sales of these products were $19 million in 2011, as compared to $16 million in 2010, and included a $1 million favorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The increase in U.S. net sales was due primarily to higher procedural volumes and positive momentum from recent product launches, partially offset by the impact of competitive launches. Within our Neuromodulation business, we market the Precision® Plus™ Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) system, the world's first rechargeable SCS device for chronic pain management. In addition, in the second quarter of 2011, we received CE Mark approval and launched our Clik™ Anchor for our Precision® Plus™ SCS System. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we received FDA approval for and launched the Infinion™ 16 Percutaneous Lead, the world's first and only 16-contact percutaneous lead. We also market the Linear™ 3-4 and Linear 3-6 Percutaneous Leads for use with our SCS systems, which are designed to provide physicians more treatment options for their chronic pain patients. We believe that we continue to have a 40Table of Contentstechnology advantage over our competitors with proprietary features such as Multiple Independent Current Control, which is intended to allow the physician to target specific areas of pain more precisely, and the broadest range of percutaneous lead configurations in the industry. We are looking to strengthen the clinical evidence with spinal cord stimulation and are committed to studies designed to demonstrate cost effectiveness or demonstrate the value of proprietary features in our SCS system. We expect to complete our VANTAGE Study, a European clinical trial for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease using our Vercise™ Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System in 2013. We believe we have an exciting opportunity in DBS with our ability to customize the field designed to precisely stimulate the target without extraneous stimulation of adjacent areas that may cause unwanted side effects. In addition, in January 2011, we completed the acquisition of Intelect Medical, Inc., a development-stage company developing advanced visualization and programming for the Vercise™ system. We believe this acquisition leverages the core architecture of our Vercise™ platform and will advance our technology in the field of deep-brain stimulation.ElectrophysiologyWe develop less-invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart. Our leading products include the Blazer™ line of ablation catheters, designed to deliver enhanced performance, responsiveness and durability. Our Blazer™ line includes our next generation Blazer™ Prime ablation catheter, and our Blazer™ Open-Irrigated Catheter, launched in select European countries, our latest radiofrequency ablation catheter designed to treat a variety of arrhythmias. Worldwide net sales of our Electrophysiology products were $147 million in 2011 and 2010. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $107 million in 2011, as compared to $112 million in 2010. Our international net sales of these products were $40 million in 2011, as compared to $35 million in 2010. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed $3 million to our worldwide Electrophysiology net sales, as compared to the prior year, worldwide Electrophysiology net sales decreased $3 million, or two percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010.Emerging MarketsAs part of our POWER strategy, described in Item 1 of this Annual Report, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence. In particular, we are focusing our efforts and increasing our investment in certain countries whose economies and healthcare sectors are growing rapidly, in order to maximize opportunities in those countries. We significantly increased sales in China, Brazil and India and continued investments in infrastructure in those countries in 2011. As a result of these efforts, during 2011, we experienced double-digit sales growth in these markets, as compared to 2010. We recently created a new Asia-Pacific regional organization under new leadership to further increase our capabilities and strengthen our position in the world's fastest growing region. We are planning to invest $150 million over a five-year period in order to expand our commercial presence in China, one of the world's largest and fastest-growing medical device markets. We expect to build a local manufacturing operation focused on serving Chinese market needs, as well as develop a world class training center for healthcare providers. In addition, we expect to further invest in local research and development and clinical studies in emerging markets.Neurovascular DivestitureIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.5 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion during 2011, and will receive an additional $50 million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we expect will occur during 2013. We are providing transitional services through a transition services agreement, and are also manufacturing and supplying products to Stryker. These transition services and supply agreements are expected to be effective through the end of 2012, subject to extension. We recorded revenue of $141 million during 2011 related to this divested business as compared to $344 million of sales of Neurovascular and other divested product lines in 2010. Our sales related to divested businesses will continue to decline as the various transition services and supply agreements terminate. See Results of Operations and Note C - Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale for additional information.Restructuring InitiativesOn an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, and better alignment of expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital and our people that are essential to our long-term success. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. These initiatives are described below, and additional information can be found in Results of Operations and Note H – Restructuring-related Activities to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.41Table of Contents2011 Restructuring planOn July 26, 2011, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a restructuring initiative (the 2011 Restructuring plan) designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies, increase competitiveness and support new investments, thereby increasing shareholder value. We estimate that the execution of the plan will reduce annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $225 million to $275 million exiting 2013, a portion of which will be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth, including priority growth and emerging markets initiatives. Key activities under the plan include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities; relocating select administrative and functional activities; rationalizing organizational reporting structures; leveraging preferred vendors; and other efforts to eliminate inefficiency. Among these efforts, we are expanding our ability to deliver best-in-class global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets. This action is intended to enable us to grow our global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many cost-reducing and productivity-enhancing opportunities. In addition, we are undertaking efforts to streamline various corporate functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies. Activities under the 2011 Restructuring plan were initiated in the third quarter of 2011 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2013.2010 Restructuring planOn February 6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to focus our business, drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the integration of our Cardiovascular and CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions; the re-alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets; and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio. We estimate that the execution of this plan will result in gross reductions in pre-tax operating expenses of approximately $200 million to $250 million, once completed in 2012. We expect to reinvest a portion of the savings into customer-facing and other activities to help drive future sales growth and support the business. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012.Plant Network OptimizationIn January 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a Plant Network Optimization program, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The program is a complement to our 2007 Restructuring plan, and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins. We estimate that the program will result in annualized run-rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65 million exiting 2012. These savings are in addition to the estimated $35 million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs from activities under our completed 2007 Restructuring plan. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012.Healthcare ReformThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. Certain provisions of the law have yet to be implemented and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not yet fully understood; therefore, it is unclear what the full impact will be from the law. The legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. U.S. net sales represented approximately 50 percent of our worldwide net sales in 2011 and, therefore, this tax burden may have a material negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Other provisions of this law, including Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and will place a significant emphasis on clinical and economic data to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchases. Any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. or internationally. Results of OperationsNet SalesAs of December 31, 2011, we had four reportable segments based on geographic regions: the United States; EMEA, consisting 42Table of Contentsof Europe, the Middle East and Africa; Japan; and Inter-Continental, consisting of our Asia Pacific and the Americas operating segments, which include the emerging markets of Brazil, China and India. The reportable segments represent an aggregate of all operating divisions within each segment. We manage our international operating segments on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. Management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using standard currency exchange rates. The regional constant currency growth rates in the tables below can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note O – Segment Reporting to our 2011 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report.The following tables provide our worldwide net sales by region and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. We have restated regional net sales for 2009 and 2010 to exclude sales from our former Neurovascular business, which we sold to Stryker Corporation in January 2011, and present net sales from this business within divested businesses in the tables below. Net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Refer to Additional Information of this Item 7 for a further discussion of management’s use of this non-GAAP financial measure. 2011 versus 20102010 versus 2009 Year EndedDecember 31,As ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasisAs ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasis(in millions)201120102009United States$4,010$4,215$4,550(5)%(5)%(7)%(7)%EMEA1,7421,6831,7503%(1)%(4)%(1)%Japan9518869087%(2)%(2)%(9)%Inter-Continental77867862115%9%9%1%International3,4713,2473,2797%1%(1)%(3)%Subtotal Core Businesses7,4817,4627,8290%(2)%(5)%(5)%Divested Businesses141344359N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide$7,622$7,806$8,188(2)%(5)%(5)%(5)%The following tables provide our worldwide net sales by division and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. 2011 versus 20102010 versus 2009 Year EndedDecember 31,As ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasisAs ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasis(in millions)201120102009Interventional Cardiology$2,495$2,602$2,859(4)%(7)%(9)%(10)%Cardiac Rhythm Management2,0872,1802,413(4)%(7)%(10)%(10)%Endoscopy1,1871,0791,00610%6%7%6%Peripheral Interventions7316696619%5%1%0%Urology/Women’s Health4984814564%2%5%5%Neuromodulation33630428511%10%7%7%Electrophysiology1471471490%(2)%(2)%(2)%Subtotal Core Businesses7,4817,4627,8290%(2)%(5)%(5)%Divested Businesses141344359N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide$7,622$7,806$8,188(2)%(5)%(5)%(5)%The divisional constant currency growth rates in the tables above can be recalculated from the reconciliations provided below.

The decrease was driven primarily by lower U.S. CRM net sales of $129 million resulting from the contraction in the U.S. ICD market in 2011, as well as lower U.S. Interventional Cardiology net sales of $119 million driven by competitive and other pricing pressures and reductions in procedural volumes across our key markets. Partially offsetting these decreases, our Endoscopy business increased U.S. net sales $21 million, as compared to 2010, due primarily to continued commercialization and adoption of products within our stent franchise, and our Neuromodulation division increased U.S. net sales $29 million, as compared to 2010, due primarily to higher procedural volumes and positive momentum from new product launches. Refer to Business and Market Overview for further discussion of our net sales.During 2010, our U.S. net sales decreased $335 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2009. The decrease was driven primarily by lower U.S. CRM net sales of $237 million, due primarily to the U.S. CRM 2010 ship hold and product removal actions impacting our ICD and CRT-D systems during 2010 in the U.S. On March 15, 2010, we announced a ship hold and removal of our field inventory related to our ICD and CRT-D systems in the U.S. after determining that certain instances of changes in the manufacturing process related to these products were not submitted for approval to the FDA. During the second quarter of 2010, we submitted the required documentation and received clearance from the FDA for these manufacturing changes and resumed distribution of our ICD and CRT-D systems. The reduction in our U.S. CRM net sales was due to lost sales of approximately $120 million during the ship hold, and a reduction of market share following the ship hold. We estimate our U.S. defibrillator market share decreased 300 basis points exiting 2010, as compared to the prior year, due primarily to these product actions. Our U.S. net sales were also negatively impacted by a decline in U.S. coronary stent system net sales of $119 million, due primarily to a decline in our share of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market as well as lower average selling prices. In addition, U.S. net sales of our Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) business decreased $15 million in 2010, as compared to 2009. These decreases were partially offset by increases of U.S. net sales in 2010 from our Endoscopy business of $24 million, $12 million attributable to our Urology/Women’s Health business, and $17 million of growth in our Neuromodulation business, as compared to 2009.International Net SalesDuring 2011, our international net sales increased $224 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed $201 million to our international net sales in 2011 as compared to 2010. Contributing to the year over year growth in international net sales, were constant currency increases from our Endoscopy business, primarily due to the strength of our WallFlex line of stents, and our Peripheral Interventions business, driven by growth in all three of our PI product franchises. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net sales in our Inter-Continental region increased $61 million, or nine percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010, primarily as a result of strong growth in China, Brazil and India as we begin to see a return on our commercial investment in these areas. Net sales in our EMEA region decreased $17 million, or one percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, driven primarily by a decline in CRM net sales. Our net sales in Japan decreased $21 million, or two percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due primarily to a decline in Interventional Cardiology net sales. Refer to Business and Market Overview for further discussion of our net sales.During 2010, our international net sales decreased $32 million, or one percent, as compared to 2009. Foreign currency fluctuations 44Table of Contentscontributed approximately $60 million to our international net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, net sales in our EMEA region decreased $16 million, or one percent, in 2010, as compared the prior year. Our net sales in Japan decreased $81 million, or nine percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to competitive launches of drug-eluting stent system technology and clinical trial enrollment limiting our access to certain drug-eluting stent system customers, as well as reductions in average selling prices. Net sales in our Inter-Continental region, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, increased $6 million, or one percent, in 2010, as compared to the prior year.Gross ProfitOur gross profit was $4.963 billion in 2011, $5.207 billion in 2010, and $5.612 billion in 2009. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit decreased to 65.1 percent in 2011, as compared to 66.7 percent in 2010 and 68.5 percent in 2009. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period: Year EndedDecember 31, 20112010Gross profit - prior year66.7 %68.5 %PROMUS® supply true-up0.6 % Drug-eluting stent system sales mix and pricing0.2 %(1.7)%Impact of CRM ship hold (0.4)%Neurovascular divestiture(1.4)% Transition-related inventory charges(0.7)% All other, including period expenses, other inventory charges and net impact of foreign currency(0.3)%0.3 %Gross profit - current year65.1 %66.7 %The primary factor contributing to the decrease in our gross profit margin during 2011, as compared to 2010, was the negative impact of lower sales of Neurovascular products and at significantly lower gross profit margins as result of the divestiture of our Neurovascular business in January 2011 and the terms of transitional supply agreements with Stryker. In addition, we recognized transition-related inventory charges of $54 million in 2011, primarily related to PROMUS® excess inventory and purchase commitments as a result of our fourth quarter 2011 launch of our internally-developed and self-manufactured next-generation PROMUS® Element™ stent system in the U.S. The decreases in 2011 were partially offset by the positive impact of a $50 million credit to cost of products sold recognized in the first quarter of 2011, related to a two-year retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our PROMUS® supply arrangement with Abbott for historical purchases of PROMUS® stent systems. Our gross profit margin may be positively or negatively impacted in the future as a result of this adjustment process. Declines in average selling prices of our products, particularly our drug-eluting stent systems, were offset by the positive impact of product mix related to sales of our drug-eluting stent systems, as we shifted sales to our internally-developed and manufactured stent systems with more favorable gross profit margins during 2011, as well as the positive impact of cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs. In addition, our gross profit margin in 2010 was negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. CRM business.The primary factor contributing to the reduction in our gross profit margin during 2010, as compared to 2009, was a decrease in sales of our higher-margin TAXUS® drug-eluting stent systems and an increasing shift towards the PROMUS® stent system during 2010, as well as declines in the average selling prices of drug-eluting stent systems. Sales of the PROMUS® stent system represented approximately 52 percent of our worldwide drug-eluting stent system sales in 2010, as compared to 40 percent in 2009. As a result of the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit margin of a PROMUS® stent system, supplied to us by Abbott, is significantly lower than our internally-developed and manufactured TAXUS® stent system and PROMUS® Element™ everolimus-eluting stent system. Our gross profit margin in 2010 was also negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. CRM business.Operating ExpensesThe following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses:45Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 % of Net % of Net % of Net(in millions) $ Sales $ Sales $ SalesSelling, general and administrative expenses 2,487 32.6 2,580 33.1 2,635 32.2Research and development expenses 895 11.7 939 12.0 1,035 12.6Royalty expense 172 2.3 185 2.4 191 2.3Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) ExpensesIn 2011, our SG&A expenses decreased $93 million, or four percent, as compared to 2010, and were 50 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. Our SG&A expenses were lower in 2011, as compared to 2010, as a result of the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker in January 2011 and lower expenses due to our restructuring initiatives and cost containment discipline. In addition, our SG&A expenses for 2011 benefited from the reversal of $20 million of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against long-outstanding receivables in Greece in 2011. These receivables had previously been fully reserved as we had determined that they had a high risk of being uncollectible due to the economic situation in Greece. During the first quarter of 2011, the Greek government converted these receivables into bonds, which we were able to monetize, reducing our allowance for doubtful accounts as a credit to SG&A expense. We continue to monitor the European economic environment for any collectibility issues related to our outstanding receivables in this region. These decreases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as additional SG&A expenses related to our recent acquisitions and global expansion initiatives.In 2010, our SG&A expenses decreased $55 million, or two percent, as compared to 2009. This decrease was related primarily to savings from our restructuring initiatives driven by lower head count and lower consulting and travel spending, as compared to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by an $11 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations. As a percentage of net sales, our SG&A expenses were slightly higher than 2009 due to the impact of maintaining compensation levels for our U.S. CRM sales force, despite the reduction in net sales of our CRM products in the U.S.Research and Development (R&D) ExpensesIn 2011, our R&D expenses decreased $44 million, or five percent, as compared to 2010, and were 30 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease in 2011 was due to the elimination of spending related to our Neurovascular business, cost reductions associated with our restructuring programs and the beginning benefits of our initiatives to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient; partially offset by increased R&D funding for our acquisitions and certain other priority growth initiatives. We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth.In 2010, our R&D expenses decreased $96 million, or nine percent, as compared to 2009. This decrease was due to the on-going re-prioritization of R&D projects and the re-allocation of spending as part of our efforts to focus on products with higher returns, as well as the delay of certain of our clinical trials.Royalty ExpenseIn 2011, our royalty expense decreased $13 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2010, and was slightly lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to royalty expense attributable to Neurovascular products which was eliminated with the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011. These royalties represented $12 million of expense in 2010.In 2010, our royalty expense decreased $6 million, or three percent, as compared to 2009. This decrease was due primarily to lower sales of our drug-eluting coronary stent systems, partially offset by the continued shift in the mix of our drug-eluting stent system sales towards the PROMUS® and PROMUS® Element™ stent systems. The royalty rate applied to sales of these stent systems is, on average, higher than that associated with sales of our TAXUS® stent systems.Loss on Program TerminationIn the second quarter of 2009, we discontinued one of our internal R&D programs in order to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $16 million, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, associated with future payments 46Table of Contentsthat we believe we remain contractually obligated to make. We do not believe that the cancellation of this program will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or cash flows.Amortization ExpenseOur amortization expense was $421 million in 2011, as compared to $513 million in 2010 a decrease of $92 million or 18 percent. This decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of Guidant Corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011. This non-cash charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Amortization expense was $513 million in 2010, as compared to $511 million in 2009, an increase of $2 million, or less than one percent.Goodwill Impairment Charges2011 ChargeWe test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. Based on market information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of 2011, we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the U.S. ICD market, which led to lower projected U.S. CRM results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our U.S. CRM business unit. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies and recorded a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $697 million, on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis, associated with this business unit during the first quarter of 2011.We used the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of the U.S. CRM reporting unit. We updated all aspects of the DCF model associated with the U.S. CRM business, including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rate and the appropriate market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital (WACC) to apply.As a result of physician reaction to study results published by the Journal of the American Medical Association regarding evidence-based guidelines for ICD implants and U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigations into hospitals’ ICD implant practices and the expansion of Medicare recovery audits, among other factors, we estimated the U.S. CRM market would experience negative growth rates in 2011, as compared to 2010. Due to these estimated near-term market reductions, as well as the economic impact of physician alignment to hospitals, recent demographic information released by the American Heart Association indicating a lower prevalence of heart failure, and increased competitive and other pricing pressures, we lowered our estimated average U.S. CRM net sales growth rates within our 15-year DCF model from the mid-single digits to the low-single digits. Partially offsetting these factors are increased levels of profitability as a result of cost-reduction initiatives and process efficiencies within the U.S. CRM business. The impact of the reduction in the size of the U.S. ICD market, and the related reduction in our forecasted 2011 U.S. CRM net sales, as well as the change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter as a result of the trends noted above were the key factors contributing to the first quarter 2011 goodwill impairment charge.In the second quarter of 2011, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, with the exception of our U.S. CRM reporting unit. Based on the remaining book value of our U.S. CRM reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of 2011, the carrying value of our U.S. CRM reporting unit exceeded its fair value, due primarily to the value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit. The remaining book value of our U.S. CRM amortizable intangible assets was approximately $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2011. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other and our accounting policies, we tested our U.S. CRM amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow basis as of March 31, 2011, in conjunction with the goodwill impairment charge, and determined that these assets were not impaired. The assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test performed during the second quarter of 2011 related to our U.S. CRM reporting unit were substantially consistent with those used in our first quarter interim impairment test; therefore, it was not deemed necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test.We continue to identify four reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the impairment test in future reporting periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM reporting unit, which holds $780 million of allocated goodwill; our U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit, which holds $2.4 billion of allocated goodwill; our U.S. Neuromodulation reporting unit, which holds $1.3 billion of allocated goodwill; and our EMEA region, which holds $4.0 billion of allocated goodwill, each as of December 31, 2011. As of the most recent annual assessment as of April 1, the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk (with the exception of the U.S. 47Table of ContentsCRM reporting unit, whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value) ranged from approximately eight percent to 15 percent. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test. The key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates, levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC rate applied. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. For each of these reporting units, relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions, including increases to the reporting unit carrying value, may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges. For example, keeping all other variables constant, a 50 basis point increase in the WACC applied to the reporting units, excluding acquisitions, would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. CRM reporting unit, and a 100 basis point increase would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. Neuromodulation, U.S. Cardiovascular and EMEA reporting units. In addition, keeping all other variables constant, a 100 basis point decrease in terminal value growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. CRM reporting unit, and a 200 basis point decrease in terminal value growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. Neuromodulation and EMEA reporting units. During the third and fourth quarters of 2011, we closely monitored these key variables and other factors and determined that we were not required to perform an interim impairment test. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management's best estimates, which we believe to be reasonable, but future declines in the business performance of our reporting units may impair the recoverability of our goodwill balance. Future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to:•decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater-than-expected declines in procedural volumes, pricing pressures, product actions, and/or disruptive technology developments;•declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition, an inability to develop or launch new products, and market and/or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls;•the impacts of the European sovereign debt crisis, including greater-than-expected declines in pricing, reductions in procedural volumes, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, or an inability to collect or factor our EMEA accounts receivable;•decreases in our profitability due to an inability to successfully implement and achieve timely and sustainable cost improvement measures consistent with our expectations, increases in our market-participant tax rate, and/or changes in tax laws;•negative developments in intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products or increase our costs to sell certain products;•the level of success of on-going and future research and development efforts, including those related to recent acquisitions, and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products;•the level of success in managing the growth of acquired companies, achieving sustained profitability consistent with our expectations, and establishing government and third-party payer reimbursement, and increases in the costs and time necessary to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully;•declines in revenue as a result of loss of key members of our sales force and other key personnel;•increases in our market-participant risk-adjusted WACC; and•changes in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses.Negative changes in one or more of these factors could result in additional impairment charges.2010 ChargeThe ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. ICD and CRT-D products, which we announced on March 15, 2010, and the forecasted corresponding financial impact on our operations created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our U.S. CRM reporting unit during the first quarter of 2010. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies and recorded an estimated non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $1.817 billion, on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis, associated with our U.S. CRM reporting unit.At the time we performed our 2010 interim goodwill impairment test, we estimated that our U.S. defibrillator market share would decrease approximately 400 basis points exiting 2010 as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions, as compared to our 48Table of Contentsmarket share exiting 2009, and that these actions would negatively impact our 2010 U.S. CRM revenues by approximately $300 million. In addition, we expected that our on-going U.S. CRM net sales and profitability would likely continue to be adversely impacted as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions. Therefore, as a result of these product actions, as well as lower expectations of market growth in new areas and increased competitive and other pricing pressures, we lowered our estimated average U.S. CRM net sales growth rates within our 15-year DCF model, as well as our terminal value growth rate, by approximately a couple of hundred basis points to derive the fair value of the U.S. CRM reporting unit. The reduction in our forecasted 2010 U.S. CRM net sales, the change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter and the reduction in profitability as a result of the recently enacted excise tax on medical device manufacturers were several key factors contributing to the impairment charge. Partially offsetting these factors was a 50 basis point reduction in our estimated market-participant risk-adjusted WACC used in determining our discount rate.Goodwill impairment charges do not impact our debt covenants or our cash flows, and are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Intangible Asset Impairment Charges2011 ChargesDuring the third quarter of 2011, we recorded a $9 million intangible asset impairment charge attributable to lower projected cash flows associated with certain technologies. During the second quarter of 2011, we recorded a $12 million intangible asset impairment charge associated with changes in the timing and amount of expected cash flows related to certain purchased research and development projects. We do not believe that these impairments, or the factors causing these impairments, will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows.2010 ChargesDuring the first quarter of 2010, due to lower than anticipated net sales of one of our Peripheral Interventions technology offerings, as well as changes in our expectations of future market acceptance of this technology, we lowered our sales forecasts associated with the product. In addition, during the third quarter of 2010, as part of our initiatives to reprioritize and diversify our product portfolio, we discontinued one of our internal research and development programs to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success. As a result of these factors, and in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies, we tested the related intangible assets for impairment and recorded a $60 million charge in the first quarter of 2010, and a $5 million charge in the third quarter of 2010 to write down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value. We do not believe that these impairments, or the factors causing these impairments, will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows. 2009 ChargesIn 2009, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $12 million, associated primarily with lower than anticipated market penetration of one of our Urology technology offerings. We do not believe that these impairments will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows.These non-cash charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Contingent Consideration ExpenseIn connection with certain of our acquisitions completed after our adoption of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, in 2009, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue-, regulatory- and commercialization-based milestones. As of the respective acquisition dates, we recorded contingent consideration liabilities representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expected to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired businesses. In accordance with ASC Topic 805, we re-measure these liabilities each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from accretion of the liability due to the passage of time, changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or changes in the expected probability and timing of achieving regulatory or commercialization milestones, changes in discount rates, and payments. We recorded net expense of $7 million during 2011 and expense of $2 million during 2010, representing the change in the estimated fair value of these obligations. The expense recorded during 2011 included a $20 million benefit related to the reduction in the fair value of a payment liability due to a revised estimate of the probability of achieving a future research and development milestone before a specified time period. We do not believe that this revised timing, or the factors causing the fair value adjustment of this contingent liability, will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows.These acquisition-related charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.49Table of ContentsAcquisition-related MilestoneIn connection with Abbott Laboratories’ 2006 acquisition of Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, Abbott agreed to pay us a milestone payment of $250 million upon receipt of an approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) to market the XIENCE V® stent system in Japan. The MHLW approved the XIENCE V® stent system in the first quarter of 2010 and we received the milestone payment from Abbott, which we recorded as a $250 million pre-tax gain. This non-recurring acquisition-related gain is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.Purchased Research and DevelopmentDuring 2009, we recorded purchased research and development charges of $21 million, associated with entering certain licensing and development arrangements, in accordance with our accounting policies and U.S. GAAP. Since the technology purchases did not involve the transfer of processes or outputs as defined by ASC Topic 805, the transactions did not qualify as business combinations. See Note A - Significant Accounting Policies to our 2011 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our accounting for purchased research and development.Restructuring Charges and Restructuring-related Activities2011 Restructuring planOn July 26, 2011, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a restructuring initiative (the 2011 Restructuring plan) designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies, increase competitiveness and support new investments, thereby increasing shareholder value. We estimate that the execution of the plan will reduce annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $225 million to $275 million exiting 2013, a portion of which will be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth, including priority growth and emerging markets initiatives. Key activities under the plan include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities; relocating select administrative and functional activities; rationalizing organizational reporting structures; leveraging preferred vendors; and other efforts to eliminate inefficiency. Among these efforts, we are expanding our ability to deliver best-in-class global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets. This action is intended to enable us to grow our global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many cost-reducing and productivity-enhancing opportunities. In addition, we are undertaking efforts to streamline various corporate functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies. Activities under the 2011 Restructuring plan were initiated in the third quarter of 2011 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2013.We estimate that the 2011 Restructuring plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $155 million to $210 million, and that approximately $150 million to $200 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays, of which we have made payments of $13 million to date. We have recorded related costs of $35 million since the inception of the plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations.The following provides a summary of our expected total costs associated with the plan by major type of cost:Type of costTotal estimated amount expected tobe incurredRestructuring charges: Termination benefits$125 million to $150 millionOther (1)$20 million to $40 millionRestructuring-related expenses: Other (2)$10 million to $20 million $155 million to $210 million(1)Includes primarily consulting fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations.(2)Comprised of other costs directly related to the 2011 Restructuring plan, including program management, accelerated depreciation, retention and infrastructure-related costs.2010 Restructuring planOn February 6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring 50Table of Contentsinitiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to focus our business, drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the integration of our Cardiovascular and CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions; the re-alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets; and the re-prioritization and diversification of our product portfolio. We estimate that the execution of this plan will result in gross reductions in pre-tax operating expenses of approximately $200 million to $250 million, once completed. We expect to reinvest a portion of the savings into customer-facing and other activities to help drive future sales growth and support our businesses. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012.We estimate that the 2010 Restructuring plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $165 million to $185 million, and that approximately $150 million to $160 million of these charges will result in cash outlays, of which we have made payments of $140 million to date. We have recorded related costs of $159 million since the inception of the plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. The following provides a summary of our expected total costs associated with the plan by major type of cost:Type of costTotal estimated amount expected tobe incurredRestructuring charges: Termination benefits$95 million to $100 millionFixed asset write-offs$10 million to $15 millionOther (1)$50 million to $55 millionRestructuring-related expenses: Other (2)$10 million to $15 million $165 million to $185 million(1)Includes primarily consulting fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations.(2)Comprised of other costs directly related to the 2010 Restructuring plan, including accelerated depreciation and infrastructure-related costs.Plant Network Optimization programIn January 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a Plant Network Optimization program, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The program is a complement to our 2007 Restructuring plan, discussed below, and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins. We estimate that the program will result in annualized run-rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65 million exiting 2012. These savings are in addition to the $35 million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs expected from activities under our completed 2007 Restructuring plan. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012.We expect that the execution of the Plant Network Optimization program will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $130 million to $145 million, and that approximately $110 million to $120 million of these charges will result in cash outlays, of which we have made payments of $70 million to date. We have recorded related costs of $124 million since the inception of the plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through cost of products sold within our consolidated statements of operations. The following provides a summary of our estimates of costs associated with the Plant Network Optimization program by major type of cost:51Table of ContentsType of costTotal estimated amount expected tobe incurredRestructuring charges: Termination benefits$35 million to $40 million Restructuring-related expenses: Accelerated depreciation$20 million to $25 millionTransfer costs (1)$75 million to $80 million $130 million to $145 million(1)Consists primarily of costs to transfer product lines among facilities, including costs of transfer teams, freight, idle facility and product line validations.2007 Restructuring planIn October 2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count reduction plan (the 2007 Restructuring plan). The plan was intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short- and long-term shareholder value. The execution of this plan enabled us to reduce research and development and SG&A expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately $500 million exiting 2008. We have partially reinvested our savings from these initiatives into targeted head count increases, primarily in customer-facing positions. In addition, we expect reductions of manufacturing costs by an annualized run-rate of approximately $35 million as a result of transfers of certain production lines. Due to the longer term nature of the manufacturing-related initiatives, we do not expect to achieve the full benefit of these reductions in manufacturing costs until 2012. The execution of this plan is now completed and resulted in total pre-tax expenses of $427 million and required cash outlays of $380 million, of which we have paid $374 million to date.We recorded restructuring charges pursuant to our restructuring plans of $89 million during 2011, $116 million during 2010, and $63 million during 2009. In addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of our accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $40 million during 2011, $53 million during 2010, and $67 million during 2009.

We expect to record additional termination benefits related to our restructuring initiatives in 2012 when we identify with more specificity the job classifications, functions and locations of the remaining head count to be eliminated. Other restructuring costs, which represent primarily consulting fees, are being recorded as incurred in accordance with ASC Topic 420. Accelerated depreciation is being recorded over the adjusted remaining useful life of the related assets, and production line transfer costs are being recorded as incurred. Retention incentives represent cash incentives, which were recorded over the service period during which eligible employees were required to remain employed with us in order to retain the payment.We have incurred cumulative restructuring charges related to our 2011 Restructuring plan, 2010 Restructuring plan and Plant Network Optimization program of $220 million and restructuring-related costs of $98 million since we committed to each plan. 53Table of ContentsThe following presents these costs by major type and by plan: (in millions)2011Restructuringplan 2010Restructuringplan PlantNetworkOptimization TotalTermination benefits$21 $90 $36 $147Fixed asset write-offs 11 11Other13 49 62Total restructuring charges34 150 36 220Accelerated depreciation 1 21 22Transfer costs 67 67Other1 8 9Restructuring-related expenses1 9 88 98 $35 $159 $124 $318Restructuring and restructuring-related costs are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.We made cash payments of $114 million in 2011 associated with restructuring initiatives pursuant to these plans, and have made total cash payments of $223 million related to our 2011 Restructuring plan, 2010 Restructuring plan and Plant Network Optimization program since committing to each plan. Each of these payments was made using cash generated from operations, and are comprised of the following:(in millions)2011Restructuringplan 2010Restructuringplan PlantNetworkOptimization TotalYear Ended December 31, 2011 Termination benefits$3 $39 $3 $45Transfer costs 27 27Other10 32 42 $13 $71 $30 $114 Program to Date Termination benefits$3 $84 $3 $90Transfer costs 67 67Other10 56 66 $13 $140 $70 $223We also made cash payments of $4 million during 2011 associated with our 2007 Restructuring plan and have made total cash payments of $374 million related to the 2007 Restructuring plan since committing to the plan in the fourth quarter of 2007.Litigation-related Charges and CreditsWe record certain significant litigation-related activity as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations. During the fourth quarter of 2011, we recognized $48 million of litigation-related charges. During 2010, we reached a settlement with Medinol Ltd., resolving the dispute we had with them that had been subject to arbitration before the American Arbitration Association. Under the terms of the settlement, we received proceeds of $104 million from Medinol, which we recorded as a pre-tax gain in our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. These charges and credits are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.In 2009, we recorded litigation-related net charges of $2.022 billion, associated primarily with an agreement to settle three patent disputes with Johnson & Johnson for $1.725 billion, plus interest. In addition, in 2009, we reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), which was formally accepted by the District Court in 2011, under which we paid $296 million 54Table of Contentsin January 2011 in order resolve the U.S. Government investigation of Guidant Corporation related to product advisories issued in 2005. We recorded a net charge of $294 million related to this matter in 2009, representing $296 million associated with the agreement, net of a $2 million reversal of a related accrual. Further, in 2009, we reduced previously recorded reserves associated with certain litigation-related matters following certain favorable court rulings, resulting in a credit of $60 million and recorded a pre-tax charge of $50 million associated with the settlement of all outstanding litigation with another party.Gain on DivestitureIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.5 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion during 2011, and we will receive an additional $50 million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we expect will occur during 2013. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $778 million ($545 million after-tax) during 2011 associated with the transaction. We also have recorded a deferred gain of approximately $30 million, included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, which is being recognized upon the performance of certain activities under the transition services and supply agreements. This non-recurring divestiture-related gain is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.Interest ExpenseOur interest expense decreased to $281 million in 2011, as compared to $393 million in 2010. The decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels, due to repayment of $1.250 billion of debt during 2011, as well as lower average borrowing rates. Our average borrowing rate was 5.4 percent in 2011 and 6.0 percent in 2010. In addition, our 2010 interest expense included $25 million of write-offs of debt issuance costs, discounts, and the impacts of the early termination of interest rate derivative contracts associated with loan prepayments; whereas 2011 interest expense included $6 million associated with the write-off of debt issuance costs, and a $3 million benefit associated with interest rate derivative contracts terminated during 2011. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note F – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2011 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations.Our interest expense decreased to $393 million in 2010, as compared to $407 million in 2009. The decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels, due to term loan prepayments throughout 2009, as well as the 2010 prepayment of our $900 million loan from Abbott Laboratories and a slight decrease in our average borrowing rate. Our average borrowing rate was 6.0 percent in 2010 and 6.1 percent in 2009. In addition, our 2010 interest expense included $15 million of write-offs of debt issuance costs and impacts of the early termination of interest rate derivative contracts, as compared to $34 million in 2009. These decreases were partially offset by the write-off of the remaining $10 million discount attributable to the Abbott loan upon prepayment.Other, netOur other, net reflected income of $19 million in 2011, expense of $14 million in 2010, and expense of $7 million in 2009. The following are the components of other, net: Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201120102009Interest income $7$13$7Foreign currency losses (12)(9)(5)Net gains (losses) on investments 27(12)3Other expense, net (3)(6)(12) $19$(14)$(7)During 2011, we recognized gains of $38 million associated with 2011 acquisitions in which we held prior equity interests. Partially offsetting these gains were net losses of $11 million in 2011 and net losses of $12 million in 2010, relating to the write-down of investments in our portfolio. The acquisition-related credit is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Tax RateThe following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate:55Table of Contents Year EndedDecember 31, 201120102009Reported tax rate 31.3 %0.2%(21.6)%Impact of certain receipts/charges* (12.0)%18.0%39.1 % 19.3 %18.2%17.5 %*These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.The change in our reported tax rate for 2011, as compared to 2010, and 2009, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. In 2011, these receipts and charges included a gain on our divestiture of the Neurovascular business, a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, other intangible asset impairment charges and restructuring-, litigation- and acquisition-related charges and credits. Our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items, related primarily to a release of valuation allowances resulting from a change in our expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets, changes in various state tax laws, the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from closing agreements with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions, and the finalization of our 2010 U.S. Federal tax return. In 2010, these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, a gain associated with the receipt of an acquisition-related milestone payment, and restructuring-related charges. In 2010, our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items, related primarily to the re-measurement of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable court ruling issued in a similar third-party case and the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar third-party case. In 2009, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, purchased research and development charges, restructuring and litigation-related net charges, a favorable tax ruling on a divestiture-related gain recognized in a prior period, and discrete tax items associated primarily with resolutions of uncertain tax positions related to audit settlements and changes in estimates for tax benefits claimed related to prior periods.We have received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and Boston Scientific Corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years. Subsequent to issuing these Notices, the IRS conceded a portion of its original assessment. The total incremental tax liability now asserted by the IRS for the applicable periods is $1.162 billion plus interest. The primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. In addition, the IRS has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our Transaction Agreement with Abbott Laboratories pertaining to the sale of Guidant's vascular intervention business to Abbott in April 2006. We do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the IRS or its resulting assessment and we believe that the IRS has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated third-party agreement with Abbott. In addition, we believe that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations. We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed, or will timely file, petitions with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the Notices of Deficiency for the tax years in challenge. No payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. However, final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2011, we had $267 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $78 million invested in money market and government funds, $88 million invested in short-term time deposits, and $101 million in interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts. Our policy is to invest excess cash in short-term marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal, and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We also have full access to our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility and $350 million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables, both described below.The following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009:56Table of Contents Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201120102009Cash provided by operating activities $1,008$325$835Cash provided by (used for) investing activities 769(480)(793)Cash used for financing activities (1,721)(496)(820)Operating ActivitiesDuring 2011, we generated $1.008 billion from operating activities, as compared to $325 million in 2010, an increase of $683 million. This increase was driven primarily by lower litigation-related payments of approximately $1.3 billion. Our 2011 litigation-related payments primarily consisted of a payment of $296 million to the DOJ; during 2010, we made payments of $1.725 billion to Johnson & Johnson related to a patent litigation settlement and received $104 million in connection with a litigation settlement with Medinol. Our cash provided by operating activities in 2011 also included proceeds of approximately $80 million related to the termination of our outstanding interest rate derivative contracts and the receipt of a $75 million manufacturing cost true-up payment from Abbott in accordance with our supply agreement. Partially offsetting these items was lower operating profit in 2011 and higher tax-related net cash outflows of approximately $400 million during 2011, primarily due to federal tax refunds received in 2010. In addition, our 2010 cash flows include the receipt of a $250 million milestone payment from Abbott.Our 2010 operating cash flows were $510 million lower than our 2009 operating cash flows. This was primarily due to net legal payments of approximately $1.621 billion in 2010, as compared to approximately $837 million of legal payments in 2009. This increase in cash outflows for legal payments was partially offset by the receipt of a $250 million milestone payment from Abbott in 2010.Investing ActivitiesDuring 2011, cash provided by investing activities was comprised primarily of proceeds from the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker. We received $1.440 billion of net cash proceeds during 2011 related to the sale of this business. We will also receive an additional $50 million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we expect will be completed during 2013. This cash inflow was partially offset by payments of $370 million for acquisitions consummated during 2011; and capital expenditures, net of proceeds on sales of fixed assets, of $288 million. Our capital expenditures in 2011 included investments to automate our distribution facilities and to enhance our manufacturing capabilities to support continued growth in our business units. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately $300 million during 2012.During 2010, our investing activities were comprised primarily of capital expenditures of $272 million, as well as payments of approximately $200 million to acquire Asthmatx, Inc. and certain other strategic assets.During 2009, our investing activities included $523 million of payments related to prior period acquisitions. Our investing activities in 2009 also included capital expenditures of $312 million, payments for investments in privately held companies, and acquisitions of businesses and certain technology rights of $54 million, which were offset by proceeds from the sale of investments in, and collection of notes receivable from, certain publicly traded and privately held companies, of $91 million.Financing ActivitiesOur cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and repurchases of common stock pursuant to our authorized repurchase programs, discussed in Note L - Stockholders' Equity to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.DebtWe made payments on debt, net of proceeds from borrowings, of $1.250 billion in 2011, $527 million in 2010, and $853 million in 2009. We had total debt of $4.261 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $5.438 billion as of December 31, 2010. During 2011, we prepaid the remaining $1.0 billion of our term loan and paid $250 million of our senior notes at maturity. The debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2011 is as follows:57Table of Contents Payments due by Period (in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter TotalSenior notes $600 $1,250 $600 $1,750 4,200 $600 $1,250 $600 $1,750 $4,200Note:The table above does not include unamortized discounts associated with our senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes.In July 2011, Fitch Ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating to BBB-, an investment-grade rating; and in February 2012, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded our corporate credit rating to Baa3, an investment-grade rating. In addition, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services has maintained an investment-grade corporate credit rating for us since 2009. We believe these rating improvements reflect the strength of our product portfolio and cash flows, the reduction of our debt, and our improved financial fundamentals. Term Loan and Revolving Credit FacilityDuring 2011, we prepaid the remaining $1.0 billion of our term loan maturities without premium or penalty.We maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, maturing in June 2013, with up to two one-year extension options subject to certain conditions. Any revolving credit facility borrowings bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin of between 1.55 percent and 2.625 percent, based on our corporate credit ratings (2.05 percent, as of December 31, 2011). In addition, we are required to pay a facility fee based on our credit ratings and the total amount of revolving credit commitments, regardless of usage, under the agreement (0.45 percent, as of December 31, 2011). The Fitch upgrade resulted in a slightly favorable reduction in the facility fee and the interest rate on the facility during 2011. Any borrowings under the revolving credit facility are unrestricted and unsecured. There were no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2011 or December 31, 2010.Our revolving credit facility agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, as follows: Covenant Requirement Actual as ofDecember 31, 2011 Maximum leverage ratio (1)3.5 times 1.6 timesMinimum interest coverage ratio (2)3.0 times 9.4 times(1)Ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, as amended, for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters.(2)Ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, as amended, to interest expense for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters.The credit agreement provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, through the credit agreement maturity, of up to $258 million in restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses related to our previously announced restructuring plans, plus an additional $300 million for any future restructuring initiatives, including our 2011 Restructuring plan. As of December 31, 2011, we had $341 million of the combined restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any litigation-related charges and credits are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA until such items are paid or received; and up to $1.5 billion of any future cash payments for future litigation settlements or damage awards (net of any litigation payments received); as well as litigation-related cash payments (net of cash receipts) of up to $1.310 billion related to amounts that were recorded in the financial statements as of March 31, 2010 are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA. As of December 31, 2011, we had $1.813 billion of the combined legal payment exclusion remaining.As of and through December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Our inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers.Senior NotesWe had senior notes outstanding in the amount of $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $4.450 billion as of December 31, 2010. In January 2011, we paid $250 million of our senior notes at maturity.58Table of ContentsOther ArrangementsWe also maintain a $350 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. In August 2011, we extended the maturity of this facility to August 2012. There were no amounts borrowed under this facility as of December 31, 2011 or December 31, 2010.We have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries that we account for as sales under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. These agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties, without recourse, of up to approximately 330 million Euro (translated to approximately $430 million as of December 31, 2011). We have no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. We de-recognized $390 million of receivables as of December 31, 2011 at an average interest rate of 3.3 percent, and $363 million as of December 31, 2010 at an average interest rate of 2.0 percent. The European sovereign debt crisis may impact our future ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain Southern European countries. Third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt. This could result in terminations of, or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs. Such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding. Within Italy, Spain, and Portugal the number of days our receivables are outstanding has continued to increase. We believe we have adequate allowances for doubtful accounts related to our Italy, Spain and Portugal accounts receivable; however, we will continue to monitor the European economic environment for any collectibility issues related to our outstanding receivables. In addition, we are currently pursuing alternative factoring providers and financing arrangements to mitigate our credit exposure to receivables in this region. During the first quarter of 2011, the Greek government converted a significant portion of our outstanding receivables into bonds, which we monetized during the first quarter and reduced our credit exposure in this country.In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with two commercial Japanese banks that provide for borrowings and promissory notes discounting of up to 18.5 billion Japanese yen (translated to approximately $240 million as of December 31, 2011). We de-recognized $188 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2011 at an average interest rate of 1.7 percent and $197 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2010 at an average interest rate of 1.7 percent. De-recognized accounts and notes receivable are excluded from trade accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. EquityDuring 2011, we received $21 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $31 million in 2010, and $33 million in 2009. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.In May 2011, our Board of Directors and shareholders approved our 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2011 LTIP), authorizing the issuance of up to approximately 145 million shares of our common stock. The 2011 LTIP provides for the grant of restricted or unrestricted common stock, deferred stock units, options to acquire our common stock, stock appreciation rights, performance awards and other stock and non-stock awards. In addition, in July 2011, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion in shares of our common stock and re-approved approximately 37 million shares remaining under a previous share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes. During 2011, we repurchased 82 million shares of our common stock for approximately $492 million, pursuant to our share repurchase authorizations. As of December 31, 2011, we had $508 million remaining authorization under our 2011 share repurchase program and 37 million shares authorized under our previous share repurchase programs.Stock-based compensation expense related to our stock ownership plans was $128 million in 2011, $150 million in 2010, and $144 million in 2009. Stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors: the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period; forfeiture levels related to unvested awards; and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.We generally make equity awards on an annual basis during the month of February. Prior to mid-2010, we expensed stock-based awards over the period between grant date and retirement eligibility, or immediately if the employee was retirement-eligible at the date of grant. Therefore, during the first quarter of each year, stock-based compensation expense has historically been significantly higher than other quarters. However, for awards granted after mid-2010, retirement-eligible employees must now provide one year of service after the date of grant in order to retain the award, should they retire. Therefore, for awards granted after mid-2010 to employees who will become retirement-eligible prior to vesting, we expense stock-based awards over the greater of the period between grant date and retirement-eligibility date or one year.59Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2011.

Purchase obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.230 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note J – Income Taxes to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits.Certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B – Acquisitions to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2011.Legal MattersThe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Physician customers, particularly in interventional cardiology, have historically moved quickly to adopt new products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However, intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, appellate courts can overturn lower court patent decisions. In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases, but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies. Several third parties have asserted that certain of our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. We have similarly asserted that other products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us. Adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity. In particular, although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with Johnson & Johnson, and have recently received several favorable court rulings, we continue to be involved in patent litigation with them, particularly relating to drug-eluting stent systems. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity. In the normal course of business, product liability, securities and commercial claims are asserted against us. Similar claims may 60Table of Contentsbe asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time. We are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and intellectual property infringement, and maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation, and other legal proceedings in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity. In addition, the medical device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigations often involving regulatory, marketing and other business practices. These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, divert the attention of our management and have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity. We generally record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. In accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies, we accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for general product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $299 million as of December 31, 2011 and $588 million as of December 31, 2010, and includes estimated costs of settlement, damages and defense. The decrease in our accrual is due primarily to the payment of $296 million to the DOJ in order resolve the U.S. government investigation of Guidant Corporation related to product advisories issued in 2005. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants. See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). We describe these accounting polices in Note A–Significant Accounting Policies to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring management’s judgment that we consider critical:Revenue RecognitionWe allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.Many of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE® Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period. We do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations; therefore, we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available; otherwise, we use our best estimate of selling price. We allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.Inventory ProvisionsWe base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant 61Table of Contentschange in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration LiabilitiesWe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including purchased research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the discounted fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations, amortization expense, and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods.We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable, as discussed in Note A, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets. To test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we calculate the fair value of these assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.We generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset (asset group). The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment.Goodwill ValuationWe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the assessment, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. For our April 1, 2011 annual impairment assessment, we identified six reporting units within the U.S., including our CRM, Neuromodulation, Endoscopy, Urology/Women's Health, Electrophysiology, and Cardiovascular (consisting of Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions) franchises, which in aggregate make up the U.S. reportable segment. In addition, we identified four international reporting units, including EMEA, Japan, Asia Pacific and the Americas. When allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition. In addition, for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets, which relate to a reporting unit’s operations, and would be considered in determining its fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit.During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessment. This approach calculates fair value 62Table of Contentsby estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average costs of capital (WACC) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units’ future expected cash flows.If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value. If we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated, we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate. We would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods, once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test.Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.We continue to identify four reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the impairment test in future reporting periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM reporting unit, which holds $780 million of allocated goodwill; our U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit, which holds $2.4 billion of allocated goodwill; our U.S. Neuromodulation reporting unit, which holds $1.3 billion of allocated goodwill; and our EMEA region, which holds $4.0 billion of allocated goodwill, each as of December 31, 2011. As of the most recent annual assessment as of April 1, the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk (with the exception of the U.S. CRM reporting unit, whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value) ranged from approximately eight percent to 15 percent. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test. The key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates, levels of profitability and terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC rate applied. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. For each of these reporting units, relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions, including increases to the reporting unit carrying value, may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges. For example, keeping all other variables constant, a 50 basis point increase in the WACC applied to the reporting units, excluding acquisitions, would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. CRM reporting unit, and a 100 basis point increase would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. Neuromodulation, U.S. Cardiovascular and EMEA reporting units. In addition, keeping all other variables constant, a 100 basis point decrease in terminal value growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. CRM reporting unit, and a 200 basis point decrease in terminal value growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. Neuromodulation and EMEA reporting units. During the third and fourth quarters of 2011, we closely monitored these key variables and other factors and determined that we were not required to perform an interim impairment test. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management's best estimates, which we believe to be reasonable, but future declines in the business performance of our reporting units may impair the recoverability of our goodwill balance. See Note D – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our 2011 and 2010 goodwill impairment charges, as well as a discussion of future events that could have a negative impact on the fair value of these reporting units.Income TaxesWe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment 63Table of Contentsis required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of these matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results.We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years.New Accounting PronouncementsStandards ImplementedASC Update No. 2009-13In October 2009, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605) - Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. Update No. 2009-13 provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables. We adopted prospectively Update No. 2009-13 as of January 1, 2011. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position for the year ended December 31, 2011.ASC Update No. 2010-20In July 2010, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2010-20, Receivables (Topic 310) - Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. Update No. 2010-20 requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures about financing receivables, including trade accounts receivable, with respect to credit quality and credit losses, including a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses. We adopted Update No. 2010-20 for our year ended December 31, 2010, except for the rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, for which we included relevant disclosures beginning in our first quarter ended March 31, 2011. Refer to Note A – Significant Accounting Policies to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for disclosures surrounding concentrations of credit risk and our policies with respect to the monitoring of the credit quality of customer accounts. In addition, refer to Note I – Supplemental Balance Sheet Information to our 2011 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010.ASC Update No. 2010-29In December 2010, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2010-29, Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations. Update No. 2010-29 clarifies paragraph 805-10-50-2(h) to require public entities that enter into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis to disclose pro forma information for such business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period, including pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the acquisition date had been as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. We were required to adopt Update No. 2010-29 for material business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011. The acquisitions we completed in 2011 are not considered material on an individual or aggregate basis and, therefore, are not subject to the disclosure requirements of Update No. 2010-29.Standards to be ImplementedASC Update No. 2011-04In May 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. Update No. 2011-04 clarifies the FASB's intent about the application of certain existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and changes certain principles or requirements for measuring or disclosing information about fair value. We are required to adopt Update No. 2011-04 for our first quarter ending March 31, 2012 and do not believe its adoption will have a significant impact on our future results of operations or financial position.ASC Update No. 2011-05In May 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 820): Presentation of Comprehensive 64Table of ContentsIncome. Update No. 2011-05 requires that net income, items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income be presented in one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements. The amendments in this Update also require that reclassifications from other comprehensive income to net income be presented on the face of the financial statements. We are required to adopt Update No. 2011-05 for our first quarter ending March 31, 2012, with the exception of the presentation of reclassifications on the face of the financial statements, which has been deferred by the FASB under ASC Update No. 2011-12, Comprehensive Income (Topic 820): Deferral of the Effective Date for Amendments to the Presentation of Reclassifications of Items Out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Our adoption of Update No. 2011-05 will not impact our future results of operations or financial position.ASC Update No. 2011-08In September 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Goodwill for Impairment. Update No. 2011-08 permits an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is ""more likely than not"" that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The ""more likely than not"" threshold is defined as having a likelihood of more than 50 percent. We are required to adopt Update No. 2011-08 for our first quarter ending March 31, 2012 and do not believe its adoption will have a significant impact on our future results of operations or financial position.Additional InformationUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Used by Boston ScientificTo supplement our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income per share. To calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP financial measure is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments' measures of profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker and are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.We believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share•Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges - These amounts represent non-cash net write-downs of our goodwill balance attributable to our U.S. Cardiac Rhythm Management business, as well as certain intangible asset balances. We remove the impact of these charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, these charges are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and are 65Table of Contentsalso excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation. Accordingly, we have excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity.•Acquisition-related (credits) charges - These adjustments consist of (a) acquisition-related gains on previously held equity interests, (b) contingent consideration fair value adjustments, (c) a gain on an acquisition-related milestone receipt, (d) due diligence, other fees and exit costs, and (e) an inventory step-up adjustment. The acquisition-related gains on previously held equity interests is a non-recurring benefit associated with acquisitions completed in the first quarter of 2011. The contingent consideration adjustments are non-cash charges representing accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments. The gain on an acquisition-related milestone resulted from a 2010 receipt related to Guidant Corporation's sale of its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott Laboratories, and is not indicative of future operating results. Due diligence, other fees and exit costs include legal, tax, severance and other expenses associated with prior acquisitions that are not representative of on-going operations. The inventory step-up adjustment is a non-cash charge related to acquired inventory directly attributable to prior acquisitions and is not indicative of our on-going operations, or on-going cost of products sold. Accordingly, we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Divestiture-related (credits) charges - These amounts represent (a) gains resulting from business divestitures and (b) fees and separation costs associated with business divestitures. We completed the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011 and the resulting gain is not indicative of future operating performance and is not used by management to assess operating performance. Fees and separation costs represent those associated with the divestiture of our Neurovascular business and are not representative of on-going operations. Accordingly, we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Restructuring and restructuring-related costs - These adjustments represent primarily severance, costs to transfer production lines from one facility to another, and other direct costs associated with our 2011 Restructuring plan, 2010 Restructuring plan, Plant Network Optimization program and 2007 Restructuring plan. These expenses are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, we excluded these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Litigation-related charges (credits) - These amounts are primarily attributable to certain significant legal and product liability charges and gains. These charges and gains are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Discrete tax items - These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions, which were initially established in prior periods as a result of intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- or litigation-related charges (credits). These adjustments do not reflect expected on-going operating results. Accordingly, we excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Amortization expense - Amortization expense is a non-cash charge and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in our credit facility agreement. We remove the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, amortization expense is excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation. Accordingly, we have excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity.Regional and Divisional Revenue Growth Rates Excluding the Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates•Changes in foreign currency exchange rates - The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict. Accordingly, we excluded the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating 66Table of Contentsperformance and a comparison to our past operating performance.Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than Boston Scientific does, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.Rule 10b5-1 Trading PlansPeriodically, certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and our own Stock Trading Policy. A Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula(s) for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including the exercise and sale of stock options, and is entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non-public information about the company.On May 27, 2011, Joseph M. Fitzgerald, our Senior Vice President and President, CRM, entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan. Mr. Fitzgerald’s plan covers the sale of 25,500 shares of our common stock to be acquired upon the exercise of (i) stock options for 15,000 shares expiring on July 17, 2011, (ii) stock options for 2,500 shares expiring on December 17, 2011 and (iii) stock options for 8,000 shares expiring on December 9, 2012. Transactions under Mr. Fitzgerald’s plan are based upon pre-established dates and stock price thresholds and will expire once all of the shares have been sold or December 7, 2012, whichever is earlier. Any transaction under Mr. Fitzgerald’s plan will be disclosed publicly through appropriate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 67Table of ContentsManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingAs the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control–Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2011, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ William H. Kucheman /s/ Jeffrey D. Capello William H. Kucheman Jeffrey D. Capello Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and ChiefFinancial Officer 68Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific CorporationWe have audited Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2011 and 2010 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 17, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLPBoston, MassachusettsFebruary 17, 201269Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $4.297 billion as of December 31, 2011 and $5.077 billion as of December 31, 2010. We recorded $87 million of other assets and $131 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2011, as compared to $82 million of other assets and $189 million of other liabilities as of December 31, 2010. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $230 million as of December 31, 2011 and $297 million as of December 31, 2010. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $281 million as of December 31, 2011 and by $363 million as of December 31, 2010. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operations.Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of $850 million in the first quarter of 2011 to convert fixed-rate debt associated with certain of our senior notes into floating-rate debt, and subsequently terminated these hedges during the third quarter of 2011. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, $4.257 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates, representing nearly 100 percent of our total debt.See Note E – Fair Value Measurements to our 2011 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding our derivative financial instruments.70Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific CorporationWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Boston Scientific Corporation at December 31, 2011 and 2010, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2011, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 17, 2012 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLPBoston, MassachusettsFebruary 17, 201271Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:42:28.886506

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Executive SummaryFinancial Highlights and TrendsIn 2012, we generated net sales of $7.249 billion, as compared to $7.622 billion in 2011, a decrease of $373 million, or five percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $123 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2012 as compared to 2011 and sales related to our divested Neurovascular business declined $19 million in 2012. Refer to Note C - Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on the Neurovascular divestiture. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales decreased $232 million, or three percent, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to constant currency declines in net sales from our Interventional Cardiology business of $266 million and Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) business of $145 million. These decreases were partially offset by constant currency increases in net sales from our Endoscopy business of $84 million, from our Peripheral Interventions business of $56 million, and net sales from our Neuromodulation business of $32 million, as compared to the same period in the prior year.1 Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our sales results.Our reported net loss in 2012 was $4.068 billion, or $2.89 per share. Our reported results for 2012 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits, restructuring- and litigation-related charges; discrete tax items and amortization expense (after-tax) of $5.001 billion, or $3.55 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2012 was $933 million, or $0.66 per share1.Our reported net income in 2011 was $441 million, or $0.29 per share. Our reported results for 2011 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- and litigation-related charges and credits; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $577 million, or $0.38 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2011 was $1.018 billion, or $0.67 per share1. The following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to those adjusted results considered by management.

Refer to Additional Information in this Item 7 for a discussion of management’s use of these non-GAAP financial measures.Cash generated by operating activities was $1.260 billion in 2012, as compared to $1.008 billion in 2011. Our operating cash flows in 2011 included approximately $300 million of one-time litigation-related payments. Our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth and returning value to shareholders by buying back shares of our common stock, pursuant to our share repurchase authorizations discussed in Note L - Stockholders' Equity to our 2012 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. During 2012, we used approximately $600 million of cash generated from operations to repurchase approximately 105 million shares of our common stock, as compared to 2011 in which approximately $492 million of cash generated from operations was used to repurchase approximately 82 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2012, we had total debt of $4.256 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $207 million and working capital of $1.250 billion. In February 2012, Moody's Investors Service upgraded our corporate credit rating to Baa3, an investment-grade rating, with a stable outlook. We now hold investment-grade ratings with all three major credit-rating agencies. We believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy.36Table of ContentsBusiness and Market OverviewEndoscopyOur Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $1.252 billion in 2012, as compared to $1.187 billion in the 2011, an increase of $65 million, or five percent. U.S. net sales of our Endoscopy products were $605 million in 2012, as compared to $562 million in the prior year. Our international net sales were $647 million in 2012, as compared to $625 million in 2011, and included a $19 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide Endoscopy net sales increased $84 million, or seven percent, in 2012, as compared to 2011. This performance was primarily the result of growth across several of our key product franchises, including our biopsy business; our biliary device franchise driven by continued growth in our Expect™ Endoscopic Ultrasound Aspiration Needle; our metal stent franchise driven by our industry-leading WallFlex® product family, which now includes our WallFlex® Biliary Transhepatic stent system for treatment of biliary strictures, launched in the first quarter of 2012; and our hemostasis franchise on the continued adoption and utilization of our Resolution Clip for gastrointestinal bleeding. In October 2010, we completed our acquisition of Asthmatx, Inc. Through Asthmatx, we design, manufacture and market a less-invasive, catheter-based bronchial thermoplasty procedure for the treatment of severe persistent asthma. The Alair® Bronchial Thermoplasty System, developed by Asthmatx, has both Conformite Europeenne (CE) Mark and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval and is the first device-based asthma treatment approved by the FDA. In the third quarter of 2012, the American Medical Association (AMA) Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) editorial panel assigned category I CPT codes specifically for bronchial thermoplasty beginning January 1, 2013. The Category I CPT procedure codes are recognized by all public and private health insurance payers in the United States, which will allow physicians and hospitals to seek reimbursement for bronchial thermoplasty procedures. We believe these codes will provide greater access to treatment for patients with poorly controlled severe asthma, help facilitate claims processing and help private payers' approve coverage for this form of treatment. We continue to focus on driving commercialization and increased awareness of the Alair® System. We expect this technology to strengthen our existing offering of pulmonary devices and contribute to future sales growth and diversification of the Endoscopy business. During 2012, we saw growth in our Alair® System product line with worldwide net sales of $11 million in 2012 as compared to approximately $4 million in 2011.Peripheral Interventions (PI)Our PI product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and other devices used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $774 million in 2012, as compared to $731 million in 2011, an increase of $43 million, or six percent. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $340 million in 2012, as compared to $310 million in 2011. Our international net sales were $434 million in 2012, as compared to $421 million in 2011, and included a $13 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide PI net sales increased $56 million, or eight percent, in 2012 as compared to 2011. The year-over-year increase in worldwide PI net sales was primarily driven by growth in our core PI franchise as the result of new product launches in stents, balloons and chronic total occlusions (CTO) devices, which we expect to continue to drive our future growth. We also recently announced the acquisition of Vessix Vascular, Inc., a developer of catheter-based renal denervation systems for the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension. Through the acquisition of Vessix we added a second generation, highly differentiated technology to our hypertension strategy, and we believe this technology will accelerate our entry into the hypertension market. We expect to launch this technology commercially in Europe and certain other international markets in 2013. We believe that offering these devices will enhance our position in assisting physicians in addressing the challenges of treating complex peripheral lesions.NeuromodulationOur Neuromodulation business offers the Precision® Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) system, used for the management of chronic pain. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products were $367 million in 2012, as compared to $336 million in 2011, an increase of $31 million, or nine percent. Our U.S. net sales of Neuromodulation products were $342 million in 2012, as compared to $317 million in the prior year, and our international net sales of these products were $25 million in 2012 and $19 million in 2011. Excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $1 million, our Neuromodulation worldwide net sales in 2012 grew nine percent as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by U.S. net sales as a result of strong sales of our Infinion™ 16 Percutaneous Lead, which received FDA approval in the fourth quarter of 2011, and continued focus on commercial execution. During the third quarter of 2012, we received CE Mark approval for use of our Vercise™ Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in Europe and we expect to begin our U.S. pivotal study for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in 2013. We believe we have an exciting opportunity in DBS with our ability to customize 37Table of Contentsthe field designed to precisely stimulate the target without extraneous stimulation of adjacent areas that may cause unwanted side effects. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2012 we received CE Mark approval for the Precision Spectra™ Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) System. The Precision Spectra System is the world's first and only SCS system with 32 contacts and 32 dedicated power sources and is designed to provide improved pain relief to a wide range of patients who suffer from chronic pain. Urology/Women’s HealthOur Urology/Women’s Health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and gynecological disorders. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $500 million in 2012, as compared to $498 million in 2011, an increase of approximately $2 million, or less than one percent. Our U.S. net sales were $355 million in 2012, as compared to $362 million in 2011. Our international net sales were $145 million in 2012, as compared to $136 million for the prior year, and included a $3 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide Urology/Women's Health net sales increased $5 million, or one percent, in 2012, as compared to 2011.Our Urology business grew approximately five percent on strong sales execution and continued commercial expansion. However, our Women's Health business declined 11 percent primarily due to continued pressures on elective procedures and lower sales levels following the FDA release of a Public Health Notice update in July 2011 regarding complications related to the use of urogynecologic surgical mesh for pelvic organ prolapse.Despite the recent performance of the Urology/Women's Health division, due primarily to the market contraction as a result of the 2011 FDA release of a Public Health Notice update, we believe that our Urology/Women's Health business has the opportunity for growth as a result of our pipeline of upcoming product launches and our plans to continue expanding the global footprint of this business. ElectrophysiologyOur Electrophysiology business develops less-invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart. Our leading products include the Blazer™ line of ablation catheters, designed to deliver enhanced performance, responsiveness and durability. Our Blazer™ line includes our next generation Blazer™ Prime ablation catheter, and our Blazer™ Open-Irrigated Catheter, launched in select European countries. Worldwide net sales of our Electrophysiology products were $147 million in 2012 and 2011. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $108 million in 2012, as compared to $107 million in 2011. Our international net sales of these products were $39 million in 2012 and $40 million in 2011 and included a negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $2 million. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide Electrophysiology net sales, increased $2 million, or one percent, in 2012, as compared to 2011. Additionally, on October 9, 2012, we acquired Rhythmia Medical, Inc., a developer of next-generation mapping and navigation solutions for use in cardiac catheter ablations and other electrophysiology procedures, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. We believe that this acquisition, as well as our other expected product launches, will help to position us to competitively participate in the fast-growing Electrophysiology market. In January 2013, the first patient was enrolled in the ZERO AF clinical trial to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Blazer® Open-Irrigated Temperature Ablation Catheter in patients with symptomatic, drug refractory paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. The results of the ZERO AF trial are expected to be used to support a FDA regulatory submission for a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation indication. The Blazer Open-Irrigated Catheter is our first entry into the open-irrigated catheter segment and is approved for use in CE Mark countries and Canada. The Blazer Open-Irrigated Catheter offers the Total Tip Cooling™ design, engineered to consistently cool the entire tip of the electrode during radiofrequency energy delivery to treat many heart rhythm disorders including paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.Cardiac Rhythm ManagementOur CRM division develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices including implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) systems and pacemaker systems that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities. Worldwide net sales of our CRM products of $1.908 billion represented approximately 26 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2012. Our worldwide CRM net sales decreased $179 million, or nine percent, in 2012, as compared to the prior year. Our U.S. CRM net sales decreased $114 million, or nine percent, in 2012 as compared to 2011. Our international CRM net sales decreased $65 million, or seven percent, in 2012, as compared to 2011, and included a $34 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates our 2012 worldwide CRM net sales decreased $145 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2011. 38Table of ContentsThe following are the components of our worldwide CRM net sales: Year Ended Year Ended(in millions) December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 U.S. International Total U.S. International TotalICD systems $858 $521 $1,379 $949 $569 $1,518Pacemaker systems 256 273 529 279 290 569CRM products $1,114 $794 $1,908 $1,228 $859 $2,087The reduction in our CRM net sales during 2012 as compared to 2011, is primarily due to the impact of average selling price pressures driven by governmental, competitive and other pricing pressures, and lower procedural volumes as a result of continued contraction in the U.S. ICD market due to a variety of factors, including physician reaction to study results published by the Journal of the American Medical Association in prior years regarding evidence-based guidelines for ICD implants, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) investigations into hospitals’ ICD implant practices and the expansion of Medicare recovery audits, as well as on-going physician alignment to hospitals. In addition, our sales levels related to replacement procedures were lower than the prior year due to historical product recalls and subsequent reductions in our denovo (first time) ICD implants following these recalls. However, we believe that our U.S. denovo ICD share increased throughout 2012 as a result of our INCEPTA™ and ENERGEN™ line of defibrillators launched in the fourth quarter of 2011, and our highly-reliable RELIANCE lead platform.In the first half of 2012, we launched our INGENIO™ family of pacemaker systems in the U.S. and EMEA, and in July 2012, we received CE Mark approval for use of our INGENIO™ and ADVANTIO™ pacemakers in patients in need of a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, which we believe represents a significant advancement to our family of pacemaker devices. In the second quarter of 2012, we received FDA approval for our INVIVE™ cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers (CRT-Ps). During the second quarter of 2012, we completed the acquisition of Cameron Health, Inc. (Cameron). Cameron developed the world's first and only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator - the S-ICD® System, which we believe is a differentiated technology that will provide us the opportunity to both increase our market share in the existing ICD market and expand that market over time. The S-ICD® system has received CE Mark approval and is available in EMEA. In September 2012 we received FDA approval for the S-ICD® system and commenced a limited commercial launch in the United States. We believe these recent product developments will help to better position us within the CRM market. Net sales from our CRM products represent a significant source of our overall net sales. Therefore, increases or decreases in our CRM net sales could have a significant impact on our results of our consolidated operations. Variables that may impact the size of the CRM market and/or our share of that market include, but are not limited to:•the on-going impact of physician alignment to hospitals, government investigations and audits of hospitals, and other market and economic conditions on the overall number of procedures performed and average selling prices;•our ability to retain and attract key members of our CRM sales force and other key CRM personnel;•the ability of CRM manufacturers to maintain the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community, the referring physician community and prospective patients in CRM technologies;•future product field actions or new physician advisories issued by us or our competitors;•our ability to timely and successfully acquire or develop and launch new or next-generation competitive products and technologies worldwide, in line with our commercialization strategies, including the S-ICD® system;•new product launches by our competitors;•variations in clinical results, reliability or product performance of our and our competitors’ products; and•delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies.During the third quarter of 2012, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge, primarily driven by the reduction in the estimated size of the U.S. CRM market and related adjustments to our business, and other competitive factors, which led to lower projected U.S. CRM results compared to prior forecasts. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2012, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge related to our EMEA business. The EMEA goodwill impairment charge was primarily driven by our revised projections for revenue growth in EMEA which were slightly lower than our previous estimates; which was primarily due to macro-economic factors and our performance in the European market. Refer to Results of Operations for further details.39Table of ContentsInterventional Cardiology (Coronary Stent Systems)We offer innovative products in the coronary stent market to treat coronary artery disease. We market our internally-developed and self-manufactured PROMUS® Element™ everolimus-eluting stent platform in all major markets worldwide, as well as our TAXUS® paclitaxel-eluting stent line, including our third-generation TAXUS® Element™ stent system. Beginning in the first quarter of 2013, we also received CE Mark approval and launched our next-generation Promus PREMIER™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System in Europe and other select geographies. We are the only company in the industry to offer a two-drug platform strategy with our paclitaxel-eluting and everolimus-eluting stent system offerings, and we offer a broad range of stent sizes. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we received CE Mark approval for the SYNERGY™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System featuring an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating. The SYNERGY Stent is unique in that its proprietary polymer and everolimus drug coating dissipate by three months. This innovation has the potential to improve post-implant vessel healing and will eliminate long-term polymer exposure, a possible cause of late adverse events. During the fourth quarter of 2012 we also enrolled the first patient in the EVOLVE II clinical trial, which is designed to further assess the safety and effectiveness of the SYNERGY Stent System and support U.S. FDA and Japanese regulatory approvals for this technology.Worldwide net sales of our coronary stent systems, with the inclusion of bare-metal stent systems, was $1.363 billion or approximately 19 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2012. Our worldwide net sales of these products decreased $257 million, or 16 percent, in 2012, as compared to 2011. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $33 million negative impact on our coronary stent system net sales in 2012, as compared to the prior year, net sales of these products decreased $224 million, or 14 percent. Our U.S. net sales of drug-eluting stent systems decreased $193 million, or 26 percent, in 2012, as compared to 2011. This decrease was primarily related to lower market share due to competitive launches in 2012, continued average selling price declines in the U.S. drug-eluting stent (DES) market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes. Our international drug-eluting stent system net sales decreased $39 million, or five percent, in 2012, as compared to the previous year. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our international drug-eluting stent system net sales decreased $11 million, or two percent due to continued lower market share related to competitive launches. During 2012, we substantially completed the conversion of our U.S. and international drug-eluting stent system sales to our self-manufactured PROMUS® Element™ and TAXUS® stent systems, which has positively impacted our gross profit margins. The following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales: Year Ended Year Ended(in millions) December 31, 2012 December 31, 2011 U.S. International Total U.S. International TotalDrug-eluting $557 $720 $1,277 $750 $759 $1,509Bare-metal 24 62 86 32 79 111 $581 $782 $1,363 $782 $838 $1,620Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial end points. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or third parties, or the market’s perception of these clinical data, may adversely impact our position in, and share of, the drug-eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market.We believe that we will continue to maintain a strong position within the worldwide drug-eluting stent market for a variety of reasons, including:•the performance benefits of our current and future technology;•the strength of our pipeline of drug-eluting stent products, which has shown favorable results in clinical trials to date;•the broad and consistent long-term results of our TAXUS® clinical trials, and the favorable results of PROMUS® Element™ and TAXUS® Element™ (ION™) stent system clinical trials to date;•our overall position in the interventional medical device market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force;•the strength of our clinical, selling, marketing and manufacturing capabilities; and•our increased presence and investment in rapidly growing emerging markets, including Brazil, Russia, India and China.40Table of ContentsHowever, a decline in net sales from our drug-eluting stent systems could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results. Significant variables that may impact the size of the drug-eluting stent market and our position within this market include, but are not limited to:•the impact of competitive pricing pressure on average selling prices of drug-eluting stent systems available in the market;•the impact and outcomes of on-going and future clinical results involving our or our competitors’ products, including those trials sponsored by our competitors, or perceived product performance of our or our competitors’ products;•new product launches by our competitors;•our ability to timely and successfully launch new or next-generation products and technologies, in line with our commercialization strategies;•physician and patient confidence in our current and next-generation technology;•changes in the overall number of percutaneous coronary intervention procedures performed, drug-eluting stent penetration rates and the average number of stents used per procedure;•delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; and•the outcome of intellectual property litigation.Interventional Cardiology (Excluding Coronary Stent Systems)In addition to coronary stent systems, our Interventional Cardiology business markets balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures, as well as intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging systems. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $816 million in 2012, as compared to $875 million in 2011, a decrease of $59 million, or seven percent. Our U.S. net sales were $311 million in 2012, as compared to $342 million in 2011. Our international net sales of these products were $505 million in 2012, as compared to $533 million in 2011, and included a $17 million unfavorable impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates for 2012, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) worldwide net sales decreased $42 million, or five percent, as compared to the prior year primarily due to competitive launches and pricing pressures. In April 2012, we received CE Mark approval for and launched our Emerge™ PTCA Dilatation Catheter in our EMEA region and we received FDA clearance for this product in September 2012. The Emerge™ Catheter is a next-generation pre-dilatation balloon catheter designed specifically to offer exceptional deliverability for physicians to address challenging lesions in coronary arteries. In addition, in October 2012, we completed the acquisition of BridgePoint Medical, Inc., a developer of proprietary, catheter-based systems to treat coronary chronic total occlusions (CTOs). Through this acquisition we expect to augment our current portfolio of Interventional Cardiology products, which we believe will enable us to be a single-source supplier for complex percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures.In January 2011, we completed the acquisition of Sadra Medical, Inc. Through our acquisition of Sadra, we are developing a fully repositionable and retrievable device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis. The Lotus™ Valve System consists of a stent-mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve. The low-profile delivery system and introducer sheath are designed to enable accurate positioning, repositioning and retrieval at any time prior to release of the aortic valve implant. We believe TAVR is one of the fastest growing medical device markets. In April 2012, we completed enrollment in the REPRISE I clinical trial, designed to evaluate the acute safety of the Lotus™ Valve System. In October 2012, we enrolled the first patients in the REPRISE II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and performance of the Lotus™ Valve System. The results of the REPRISE II trial are expected to be used to support CE Mark and other international regulatory approvals, which we anticipate receiving in the second half of 2013.Due to revised expectations of the required effort, time and cost involved in completing Sadra's in-process research and development projects and bringing the related products to market, we recorded an intangible asset impairment charge in the second quarter of 2012. Refer to Results of Operations for further details. We continue to believe that the technology associated with the Sadra acquisition represents a significant future opportunity for us in the structural heart market. In March 2011, we completed the acquisition of Atritech, Inc. Atritech developed a novel device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. The WATCHMAN® Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology is the first device proven in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to anticoagulant drugs, and is approved for use in CE Mark countries. In August 2012, European regulators approved an expanded indication for the WATCHMAN® 41Table of ContentsLeft Atrial Appendage Closure Device. The new indication offers patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), and a contraindication to warfarin and the newer oral anticoagulants, a new treatment option for stroke reduction. We are integrating the operations of the Atritech business and are leveraging expertise from both our Electrophysiology and Interventional Cardiology divisions in the commercialization of the WATCHMAN® device. Emerging MarketsAs part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, described in Item 1 of this Annual Report, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence. In particular, we are focusing our efforts and increasing our investment in certain countries whose economies and healthcare sectors are growing rapidly, in order to maximize opportunities in those countries. We significantly increased sales in Brazil, Russia, India and China and continued investments in infrastructure in those countries, as well as others, in 2011 and throughout 2012. As a result of these efforts, during 2012, we experienced double-digit sales growth in these markets, as compared to 2011. We recently created a new Asia-Pacific regional organization under new leadership to further increase our capabilities and strengthen our position in this fast growing region. Restructuring InitiativesOn an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, and better alignment of expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital and our people that are essential to our long-term success. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. These initiatives are described below, and additional information can be found in Results of Operations and Note H – Restructuring-related Activities to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.2011 Restructuring PlanOn July 26, 2011, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a restructuring initiative (the 2011 Restructuring plan) designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies, increase competitiveness and support new investments, thereby increasing shareholder value. The original estimate of the plan was a reduction of annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $225 million to $275 million exiting 2013, a substantial portion of which is expected to be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth, including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets. Key activities under the plan include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities; relocating select administrative and functional activities; rationalizing organizational reporting structures; leveraging preferred vendors; and other efforts to eliminate inefficiency. Among these efforts, we are expanding our ability to deliver best-in-class global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets. This action is intended to enable us to grow our global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many cost-reducing and productivity-enhancing opportunities. In addition, we are undertaking efforts to streamline various corporate functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies. On January 25, 2013, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expansion of our 2011 restructuring program (the Expansion). The Expansion is intended to further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiencies and support new investments, which we expect to increase shareholder value. We estimate that the Expansion will reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $100 million to $115 million exiting 2013; and that the total 2011 restructuring program, including the Expansion (the Total Program), will reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $340 million to $375 million exiting 2013. We expect a substantial portion of the Total Program savings to be reinvested in targeted areas for future growth, including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets. Key activities under the Expansion include further initiatives to: standardize and automate certain processes and activities; relocate select administrative and functional activities; rationalize organizational reporting structures; expand shared services; and align expenses to revenues within certain divisions and geographic regions. In addition, they include further efforts to streamline various corporate functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies. Key activities under the Total Program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2013.2010 Restructuring PlanOn February 6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to focus our business, drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value. Key activities under the plan included the restructuring of certain of our businesses and corporate functions; the re-alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets; and the reprioritization and diversification of 42Table of Contentsour product portfolio. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and were completed by the end of 2012, and resulted in gross reductions in pre-tax operating expenses of approximately $250 million. A portion of these savings were reinvested into customer-facing positions and other commercial resources and infrastructure. Plant Network OptimizationIn January 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a Plant Network Optimization program, intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The program was a complement to our 2007 restructuring plan, and was intended to improve overall gross profit margins. The program has resulted in annualized run-rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65 million exiting 2012. These savings are in addition to the $35 million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs from activities under our 2007 restructuring plan. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and were substantially completed during 2012.Neurovascular DivestitureIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.5 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion during 2011, $10 million during 2012, and will receive an additional $40 million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we expect will occur during 2013. We are providing transitional services through a transition services agreement, and are also manufacturing and supplying products to Stryker through a supply agreement. These transition services and supply arrangements are expected to end in 2013. We recorded revenue of $122 million during 2012 related to this divested business as compared to $141 million during 2011 and $344 million of sales of Neurovascular and other divested product lines in 2010. Our sales related to divested businesses will continue to decline as the various transition services and supply agreements terminate in 2013. See Results of Operations and Note C - Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale for additional information.Healthcare ReformThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. Certain provisions of the law have yet to be implemented and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not yet fully understood; therefore, it is unclear what the full impact will be from the law. The legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. We intend to record this tax within our selling, general and administrative expenses and expect that our excise tax liability for 2013 will be up to $80 million. Other provisions of this law, including Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and will place a significant emphasis on clinical and economic data to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchases. Any changes that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. or internationally. 43Table of ContentsResults of OperationsNet SalesAs of December 31, 2012, we had four reportable segments based on geographic regions: the United States; EMEA, consisting of Europe, the Middle East and Africa; Japan; and Inter-Continental, consisting of our Asia Pacific and the Americas operating segments, which include the emerging markets of Brazil, China and India. The reportable segments represent an aggregate of all operating divisions within each segment. We manage our international operating segments on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. Management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using standard currency exchange rates. The regional constant currency growth rates in the tables below can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note O – Segment Reporting to our 2012 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The following tables provide our worldwide net sales by region and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. We have restated regional net sales for 2011 and 2010 to exclude sales from our former Neurovascular business, which we sold to Stryker Corporation in January 2011, and present net sales from this business within divested businesses in the tables below. Net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and net sales from divested businesses are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Refer to Additional Information of this Item 7 for a further discussion of management’s use of this non-GAAP financial measure. 2012 versus 20112011 versus 2010 Year EndedDecember 31,As ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasisAs ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasis(in millions)201220112010 (restated)*(restated)* United States$3,756$4,010$4,215(6)%(6)%(5)%(5)%EMEA1,5681,7211,662(9)%(3)%4%(1)%Japan931951886(2)%(2)%7%(2)%Inter-Continental8727996999%11%14%9%International3,3713,4713,247(3)%1%7%1%Subtotal Core Businesses7,1277,4817,462(5)%(3)%0%(2)%Divested Businesses122141344N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide$7,249$7,622$7,806(5)%(3)%(2)%(5)%* We have restated prior year regional detail to conform to current year presentation.44Table of ContentsThe following tables provide our worldwide net sales by division and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. 2012 versus 20112011 versus 2010 Year EndedDecember 31,As ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasisAs ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasis(in millions)201220112010Interventional Cardiology$2,179$2,495$2,602(13)%(11)%(4)%(7)%Cardiac Rhythm Management1,9082,0872,180(9)%(7)%(4)%(7)%Endoscopy1,2521,1871,0795%7%10%6%Peripheral Interventions7747316696%8%9%5%Urology/Women’s Health500498481—%1%4%2%Neuromodulation3673363049%9%11%10%Electrophysiology147147147—%1%—%(2)%Subtotal Core Businesses7,1277,4817,462(5)%(3)%—%(2)%Divested Businesses122141344N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide$7,249$7,622$7,806(5)%(3)%(2)%(5)%The divisional constant currency growth rates in the tables above can be recalculated from the reconciliations provided below.

The decrease was driven primarily by lower U.S. Interventional Cardiology net sales of $232 million primarily as a result of lower market share due to competitive launches in 2012, continued average selling price declines in the U.S. DES market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes. In addition our U.S. CRM sales declined $114 million due to lower procedural volumes as a result of a contraction in the U.S. ICD market, lower average selling prices, and lower replacement volumes. Partially offsetting these decreases were our Endoscopy business that increased U.S. net sales $43 million, as compared to 2011, due to growth across several of its key product franchises; our Neuromodulation division which increased U.S. net sales $25 million, as compared to 2011, due to market share increases from strong commercial execution and continued market expansion; and our Peripheral Interventions business which increased U.S. net sales of $30 million, as compared to 2011, on the strength of several new product launches. Refer to Business and Market Overview for further discussion of our net sales.During 2011, our U.S. net sales decreased $205 million, or five percent, as compared to 2010. The decrease was driven primarily by lower U.S. CRM net sales of $129 million resulting from the contraction in the U.S. ICD market in 2011, as well as lower U.S. Interventional Cardiology net sales of $119 million driven by competitive and other pricing pressures and reductions in procedural volumes across our key markets. Partially offsetting these decreases, our Endoscopy business increased U.S. net sales $21 million, 45Table of Contentsas compared to 2010, due primarily to continued commercialization and adoption of products within our stent franchise, and our Neuromodulation division increased U.S. net sales $29 million, as compared to 2010, due primarily to higher procedural volumes and positive momentum from new product launches.International Net SalesDuring 2012, our international net sales decreased $100 million, or three percent, as compared to 2011. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates negatively impacted our international net sales by $122 million in 2012 as compared to 2011. Excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $122 million, international net sales grew $22 million or one percent as compared to 2011. Excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange of $13 million, sales in our Inter-Continental region increased $86 million, or 11 percent, in 2012, as compared to 2011. The increase in our Inter-Continental sales was due to growth across several of our businesses and continued growth in Brazil, India and China. Excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange of $105 million, net sales in our EMEA region decreased $48 million, or three percent, in 2012, as compared to 2011; driven primarily by a decline in CRM and Interventional Cardiology net sales of $33 million and $37 million, respectively, partially offset by growth in all other businesses. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange of $4 million, our net sales in Japan decreased $16 million, or two percent, in 2012, as compared to 2011, due primarily to a decline in Interventional Cardiology net sales. Refer to Business and Market Overview for further discussion of our net sales.During 2011, our international net sales increased $224 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2010. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates contributed $201 million to our international net sales in 2011 as compared to 2010. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, net sales in our Inter-Continental region increased $64 million, or nine percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010, primarily as a result of strong growth in Brazil, India and China as we began to see a return on our commercial investment in these areas. Net sales in our EMEA region decreased $20 million, or one percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, driven primarily by a decline in CRM net sales. Our net sales in Japan decreased $21 million, or two percent, in 2011, as compared to 2010, excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, due primarily to a decline in Interventional Cardiology net sales.Gross ProfitOur gross profit was $4.900 billion in 2012, $4.963 billion in 2011, and $5.207 billion in 2010. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased to 67.6 percent in 2012, as compared to 65.1 percent in 2011 and 66.7 percent in 2010. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period: Year EndedDecember 31, 20122011Gross profit - prior year65.1 %66.7 %PROMUS® supply true-up(0.6)%0.6 %Neurovascular divestiture— %(1.4)%Manufacturing cost reductions1.4 %— %Transition-related inventory charges (credits)0.7 %(0.7)%All other, including other inventory charges, other period expense and net impact of foreign currency1.3 %(0.3)%Sales mix and pricing(0.3)%0.2 %Gross profit - current year67.6 %65.1 %The increase in our gross profit margin for 2012, as compared to 2011, is primarily the result of cost reductions from our restructuring and other process improvement programs. Our gross margin was negatively impacted by declines in average selling prices related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products; however, these declines were largely offset by the full conversion to our internally-developed and self-manufactured next-generation PROMUS® Element™ stent system during 2012. Our PROMUS® Element™ stent system has significantly higher gross margins than the prior generation PROMUS® stent system, which was supplied to us by Abbott Laboratories. Additionally, affecting our year over year comparison of year to date gross margin was the impact of a one-time $50 million credit to cost of products sold, related to a two-year retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our PROMUS® supply arrangement with Abbott and product transition-related inventory charges of $54 million recorded in 2011, discussed further below.46Table of ContentsThe primary factor contributing to the decrease in our gross profit margin during 2011, as compared to 2010, was the negative impact of lower sales of Neurovascular products and at significantly lower gross profit margins as result of the divestiture of our Neurovascular business. In addition, we recognized transition-related inventory charges of $54 million in 2011, primarily related to PROMUS® excess inventory and purchase commitments as a result of our fourth quarter 2011 launch of our internally-developed and self-manufactured next-generation PROMUS® Element™ stent system in the U.S. The decreases in 2011 were partially offset by the positive impact of a $50 million credit to cost of products sold recognized in the first quarter of 2011, related to a two-year retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our PROMUS® supply arrangement with Abbott for historical purchases of PROMUS® stent systems. Declines in average selling prices of our products, particularly our drug-eluting stent systems, were offset by the positive impact of product mix related to sales of our drug-eluting stent systems, as we began shifting sales to our internally-developed and manufactured stent systems with more favorable gross profit margins during 2011. In addition, our gross profit margin in 2010 was negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. CRM business.We are subject to a final retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our PROMUS® supply arrangement with Abbott for historical purchases of PROMUS® stent systems. We may record a one-time benefit or charge to our gross profit in the future as a result of this adjustment process.Operating ExpensesThe following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2012 2011 2010 % of Net % of Net % of Net(in millions) $ Sales $ Sales $ SalesSelling, general and administrative expenses 2,535 35.0 2,487 32.6 2,580 33.1Research and development expenses 886 12.2 895 11.7 939 12.0Royalty expense 153 2.1 172 2.3 185 2.4Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) ExpensesIn 2012, our SG&A expenses increased $48 million, or two percent, as compared to 2011, and were 240 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. This increase was driven primarily by continued investments in acquisitions and in commercial resources and infrastructure for global expansion, particularly in emerging markets, and a non-recurring asset impairment charge as a result of a program termination. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase was a benefit recorded in 2011 as a result of a reversal of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against long-outstanding receivables in Greece. These increases in SG&A were partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Beginning in January 2013, as a result of new legislation, all medical device manufacturers will be subject to a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices. We intend to record this tax within our selling, general and administrative expenses and expect that our excise tax liability for 2013 will be up to $80 million. In 2011, our SG&A expenses decreased $93 million, or four percent, as compared to 2010, and were 50 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. Our SG&A expenses were lower in 2011, as compared to 2010, as a result of the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker in January 2011 and lower expenses due to our restructuring initiatives and cost containment discipline. In addition, our SG&A expenses for 2011 benefited from the reversal of $20 million of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against long-outstanding receivables in Greece in 2011. These receivables had previously been fully reserved as we had determined that they had a high risk of being uncollectible due to the economic situation in Greece. During the first quarter of 2011, the Greek government converted these receivables into bonds, which we were able to monetize, reducing our allowance for doubtful accounts as a credit to SG&A expense. These decreases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as additional SG&A expenses related to acquisitions and global expansion initiatives.Research and Development (R&D) ExpensesIn 2012, our R&D expenses decreased $9 million, or approximately one percent, as compared to 2011, and were 50 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. The slight decrease in overall spending in 2012 was due to continued focus on cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs and the benefits from our strategy to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient, partially offset by increased R&D funding for our acquisitions. We remain committed 47Table of Contentsto advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth.In 2011, our R&D expenses decreased $44 million, or approximately five percent, as compared to 2010, and were 30 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease in 2011 was due to the elimination of spending related to our Neurovascular business and cost reductions associated with our restructuring programs.Royalty ExpenseIn 2012, our royalty expense decreased $19 million, or 11 percent, as compared to 2011, and was 20 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to lower sales of our royalty-bearing products within our Interventional Cardiology business.In 2011, our royalty expense decreased $13 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2010, and was slightly lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to royalty expense attributable to Neurovascular products which was eliminated with the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011. These royalties represented $12 million of expense in 2010.Amortization ExpenseOur amortization expense was $395 million in 2012, as compared to $421 million in 2011, a decrease of $26 million or six percent. This decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of Guidant Corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011. This non-cash charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Amortization expense was $421 million in 2011, as compared to $513 million in 2010, a decrease of $92 million, or 18 percent. This decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of Guidant Corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011.Goodwill Impairment Charges2012 ChargesWe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In the second quarter of 2012, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our EMEA reporting unit was impaired and recorded a $3.602 billion ($3.579 billion after-tax) charge in the second quarter of 2012. We finalized the second step of the EMEA goodwill impairment test during the third quarter of 2012, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles -Goodwill and Other, and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization. In the third quarter of 2012, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a non-cash $748 million (pre- and after-tax) charge associated with our U.S. CRM reporting unit, primarily driven by the reduction in the estimated size of the U.S. CRM market, related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors, which led to lower projected U.S. CRM results compared to prior forecasts. We finalized the second step of the U.S. CRM goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of 2012, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles -Goodwill and Other, and there were no adjustments to the charge upon finalization. In our goodwill impairment tests we used the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of our EMEA and U.S. CRM reporting units, as described in our accounting policies. We updated all aspects of the DCF models associated with the EMEA and U.S. CRM businesses, including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and the appropriate market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average costs of capital (WACC) to apply.EMEAAs a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test in the second quarter, we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the EMEA reporting unit would be slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macro-economic factors and our performance in the European market. We updated short-term operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for EMEA prepared by management. We reduced the EMEA long-term growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our 15-year DCF model for EMEA by approximately 100 basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of the economic uncertainty in Europe. While we continue to 48Table of Contentsproject revenue growth in our EMEA business, our expectations for future growth and profitability were lower than our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measures. The declines expected in the EMEA market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units. The aggregate amount of goodwill that remains associated with our EMEA reporting unit is $556 million as of December 31, 2012. In addition, the remaining book value of our other EMEA intangible assets allocated to our EMEA reporting unit is approximately $1.563 billion as of December 31, 2012. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, we tested our EMEA amortizable intangible assets as of April 1, 2012 for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow basis, and determined that these assets were not impaired. We also tested our indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with EMEA as of April 1, 2012 and recorded an impairment charge related to the in-process research and development associated with our acquisition of Sadra Medical, Inc. See Intangible Asset Impairment Charges below for a further discussion of this impairment. U.S. CRMThe U.S. CRM market is dynamic, highly competitive and difficult to forecast; in the third quarter of 2012, we lowered our projections for the U.S. CRM market size and our future revenue levels within this market, primarily to reflect recent changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth, adjustments to our business and other competitive factors. This reduction warranted an interim goodwill impairment test for our U.S. CRM reporting unit. The declines expected in the U.S. CRM market did not impact our assumptions related to other reporting units. The increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes are primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals, efforts to reduce health care costs, focus on appropriate device usage, replacement volumes and competition, and have been more impactful to the U.S. CRM business than previously estimated. In addition, we recently aligned certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return. As a result of these factors, we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our 15 year DCF model for the U.S. CRM reporting unit by approximately 250 basis points. We continue to analyze business trends using all available information and our U.S. CRM goodwill remains sensitive to changes in expectations of future growth of this market and our performance. Based on the remaining book value of our U.S. CRM reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge recorded during the third quarter of 2012, the carrying value of our U.S. CRM reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value, due primarily to the value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit. The remaining book value of the amortizable intangible assets allocated to the U.S. CRM reporting unit was approximately $3.303 billion as of December 31, 2012. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, we tested the amortizable intangible assets as of September 30, 2012, in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our U.S. CRM reporting unit. We performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis, and concluded that these assets were not impaired. However, following the recent declines in our CRM projections, the recoverability of our CRM-related amortizable intangibles ($4.636 billion globally) are sensitive to changes in future cash flow assumptions and our CRM business performance. The $4.636 billion of CRM-related amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods. An impairment of a material portion of our CRM-related amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period.We continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM reporting unit, which holds $216 million of remaining allocated goodwill; our U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit, which holds $2.380 billion of allocated goodwill; and our U.S. Neuromodulation reporting unit, which holds $1.266 billion of allocated goodwill, each as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk (with the exception of the U.S. CRM reporting unit, whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value) was approximately seven to 11 percent. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance, declines in our market share due to competitive launches, and continued average selling price declines in the U.S. drug-eluting stent (DES) market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. The key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability. Terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges. For example, keeping all other variables constant, a 80 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the U.S. Neuromodulation reporting unit. A 90 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would 49Table of Contentsrequire that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit. An increase in the WACC applied of 70 basis points would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the U.S. Neuromodulation and U.S. Cardiovascular reporting units. Given that the carrying value of the U.S. CRM reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value, any negative changes in the key variables or values associated with this reporting unit would likely require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in a future reporting period. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management's best estimates, which we believe to be reasonable, but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances. Future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units and/or amortizable intangible assets include, but are not limited to:•decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater-than-expected declines in procedural volumes, pricing pressures, product actions, and/or competitive technology developments;•declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition, an inability to develop or launch new and next-generation products and technology features in line with our commercialization strategies, and market and/or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls;•decreases in our profitability due to an inability to successfully implement and achieve timely and sustainable cost improvement measures consistent with our expectations, increases in our market-participant tax rate, and/or changes in tax laws;•negative developments in intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products or increase our costs to sell certain products;•the level of success of on-going and future research and development efforts, including those related to recent acquisitions, and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products;•the level of success in managing the growth of acquired companies, achieving sustained profitability consistent with our expectations, establishing government and third-party payer reimbursement, and increases in the costs and time necessary to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully;•changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses;•increases in our market-participant risk-adjusted WACC; and•declines in revenue as a result of loss of key members of our sales force and other key personnel.Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in additional impairment charges.2011 ChargeBased on market information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of 2011, we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the U.S. ICD market, which led to lower projected U.S. CRM results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our U.S. CRM business unit. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies and recorded a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $697 million, on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis, associated with this business unit during the first quarter of 2011. 2010 ChargeAs a result of ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. ICD and CRT-D products, which we announced on March 15, 2010, and the forecasted corresponding financial impact on our operations we concluded there was an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our U.S. CRM reporting unit during the first quarter of 2010. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies and recorded a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $1.817 billion, on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis, associated with our U.S. CRM reporting unit.Goodwill impairment charges do not impact our debt covenants or our cash flows, and are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.50Table of ContentsIntangible Asset Impairment ChargesOn a quarterly basis, we monitor for events or other potential indicators of impairment that would warrant an interim impairment test of our intangible assets. 2012 ChargesDuring the third quarter of 2012, we performed our annual impairment test of all in-process research and development projects, and our indefinite lived core technology assets. Based on the results of our annual test, we recorded total impairment charges of $13 million to write-down the balances of certain in-process projects to their fair value. These charges were primarily due to increased expectations in the cost to bring an in-process project to market in a certain geographic region and lower future revenue expectations associated with an in-process project.Following the recent declines in our CRM projections, the recoverability of our CRM-related amortizable intangibles ($4.636 billion globally) are sensitive to changes in future cash flow assumptions and our CRM business performance. The $4.636 billion of CRM-related amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods. An impairment of a material portion of our CRM-related amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period. See Goodwill Impairment Charges above for discussion of future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units and/or amortizable intangible assets.During the second quarter of 2012, as a result of revised estimates developed in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process and annual goodwill impairment test, we performed an interim impairment test of our in-process research and development projects associated with our acquisition of Sadra Medical, Inc. Based on our impairment analysis, we revised our expectations of the required effort, time and cost involved in completing the in-process projects and bringing the related products to market. As a result of these changes, we recorded an impairment charge of $129 million to write-down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value during the second quarter of 2012. 2011 ChargesDuring the third quarter of 2011, we recorded a $9 million intangible asset impairment charge attributable to lower projected cash flows associated with certain technologies. During the second quarter of 2011, we recorded a $12 million intangible asset impairment charge associated with changes in the timing and amount of the expected cash flows related to certain purchased research and development projects. 2010 ChargesDuring the first quarter of 2010, due to lower than anticipated net sales of one of our Peripheral Interventions technology offerings, as well as changes in our expectations of future market acceptance of this technology, we lowered our sales forecasts associated with a product. In addition, during the third quarter of 2010, as part of our initiatives to reprioritize and diversify our product portfolio, we discontinued one of our internal research and development programs to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success. As a result of these factors, we tested the related intangible assets for impairment and recorded a $60 million charge in the first quarter of 2010, and a $5 million charge in the third quarter of 2010 to write down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value. Intangible asset impairment charges are non-cash charges that are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Contingent Consideration ExpenseCertain of our acquisitions involve contingent consideration arrangements. Payment of additional consideration is generally contingent on the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones, including attaining specified revenue levels, achieving product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones.51Table of ContentsWe recorded a net benefit related to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities of $6 million in 2012 and net expenses of $7 million in 2011 and $2 million in 2010. Contingent consideration expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating performance. See Note B – Acquisitions to our 2012 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our contingent consideration associated with our acquisitions. Acquisition-related MilestoneIn connection with Abbott Laboratories’ 2006 acquisition of Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, Abbott agreed to pay us a milestone payment of $250 million upon receipt of an approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) to market the XIENCE V® stent system in Japan. The MHLW approved the XIENCE V® stent system in the first quarter of 2010 and we received the milestone payment from Abbott, which we recorded as a $250 million pre-tax gain. This non-recurring acquisition-related gain is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.Restructuring Charges and Restructuring-related Activities2011 Restructuring PlanOn July 26, 2011, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a restructuring initiative (the 2011 Restructuring plan) designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies, increase competitiveness and support new investments, thereby increasing shareholder value. The original estimate of the plan was a reduction of annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $225 million to $275 million exiting 2013, a substantial portion of which is expected to be reinvested in targeted areas necessary for future growth, including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets. Key activities under the plan include standardizing and automating certain processes and activities; relocating select administrative and functional activities; rationalizing organizational reporting structures; leveraging preferred vendors; and other efforts to eliminate inefficiency. Among these efforts, we are expanding our ability to deliver best-in-class global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets. This action is intended to enable us to grow our global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many cost-reducing and productivity-enhancing opportunities. In addition, we are undertaking efforts to streamline various corporate functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies. On January 25, 2013, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expansion of the 2011 restructuring program (the Expansion). The Expansion is intended to further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiencies and support new investments, which we expect to increase stockholder value. We estimate that the Expansion will reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $100 million to $115 million exiting 2013; and that the total 2011 Restructuring plan, including the Expansion (Total Program), will reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $340 million to $375 million exiting 2013. We expect a substantial portion of the Total Program savings to be reinvested in targeted areas for future growth, including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets. Key activities under the Expansion include further initiatives to: standardize and automate certain processes and activities; relocate select administrative and functional activities; rationalize organizational reporting structures; expand shared services; and align expenses to revenues within certain divisions and geographic regions. In addition, they include further efforts to streamline various corporate functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies. Key activities under the Total Program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2013.52Table of ContentsWe estimate that the implementation of the Expansion will result in pre-tax charges of approximately $140 million to $160 million, of which approximately $100 million to $120 million is expected to result in future cash outlays. We estimate that the implementation of the Total Program will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $300 million to $355 million, and that approximately $270 million to $300 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays, of which we had made payments of $128 million as of December 31, 2012. The following table provides a summary of our estimates of costs associated with the Expansion and the Total Program by major type of cost:Type of costTotal estimated amount expected tobe incurredExpansionTotal ProgramRestructuring charges: Termination benefits$55 million to $65 million$185 million to $210 millionOther (1)$50 million to $55 million$70 million to $90 millionRestructuring-related expenses: Other (2)$35 million to $40 million$45 million to $55 million $140 million to $160 million$300 million to $355 million(1)Includes primarily consulting fees, fixed asset write-offs and costs associated with contractual cancellations.(2)Comprised of other costs directly related to the restructuring program, including program management, accelerated depreciation, retention and infrastructure-related costs.As of December 31, 2012, we have recorded costs of $184 million since the inception of the 2011 Restructuring plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations.2010 Restructuring PlanOn February 6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to focus our business, drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value. Key activities under the plan included the restructuring of certain of our businesses and corporate functions; the re-alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets; and the re-prioritization and diversification of our product portfolio. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and were complete by the end of 2012, and resulted in gross reductions in pre-tax operating expenses of approximately $250 million. A portion of these savings were reinvested into customer-facing positions and other commercial resources and infrastructure.The execution of the 2010 Restructuring plan resulted in total pre-tax charges of $160 million, and required cash outlays of $145 million, of which we had made payments of $144 million to date. We have recorded a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations.Plant Network Optimization ProgramIn January 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a plant network optimization initiative (the Plant Network Optimization program), intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The program was a complement to the restructuring initiatives approved by our Board of Directors in 2007 (the 2007 Restructuring plan), and was intended to improve overall gross profit margins. The program has resulted in annualized run-rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65 million exiting 2012. These savings are in addition to the $35 million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs from activities under our 2007 Restructuring plan. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and were substantially completed during 2012.We expect that the execution of the Plant Network Optimization program will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $132 million to $135 million, and that approximately $105 million to $110 million of these charges will result in cash outlays, of which we had made payments of $102 million to date. We have recorded related costs of $132 million since the inception of the plan, and recorded a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through cost of products sold within our consolidated statements of operations.53Table of ContentsIn aggregate, we recorded restructuring charges pursuant to our restructuring plans of $136 million during 2012, $89 million during 2011, and $116 million during 2010. In addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of our accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $24 million during 2012, $40 million during 2011, and $53 million during 2010. Restructuring and restructuring-related costs are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.We made cash payments of $149 million in 2012, $114 million in 2011 and $133 million in 2010 associated with our restructuring initiatives.See Note H - Restructuring Related Activities to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details related to our restructuring plans.Litigation-related Charges and CreditsDuring 2012 and 2011, we recorded net litigation-related charges in the amount of $192 million and $48 million, respectively. In 2010, we recorded a litigation-related credit of $104 million associated with a settlement of a dispute we had with Medinol Ltd. These charges and credits are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants.Gain on DivestitureIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.500 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion during 2011, including an upfront payment of $1.426 billion, and $24 million which was placed into escrow and released throughout 2011 upon the completion of local closings in certain foreign jurisdictions. During 2012, we received an additional $10 million of consideration, which we recorded as a gain in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We will receive the remaining $40 million of consideration upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we expect will occur during 2013. Due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the Neurovascular business, the divestiture does not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $778 million during 2011 associated with the transaction and a gain of $15 million during 2012. These divestiture-related gains are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.Interest ExpenseOur interest expense decreased to $261 million in 2012, as compared to $281 million in 2011. The decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels, due to repayment of $1.250 billion of debt during 2011, and the refinancing of our credit facility in April 2012 at lower average costs. Our average borrowing rate was 5.5 percent in 2012 and 5.4 percent in 2011. Our 2011 interest expense included $6 million associated with the write-off of debt issuance costs, and a $3 million benefit associated with interest rate derivative contracts terminated during 2011. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note F – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2012 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations.Our interest expense was $281 million in 2011, as compared to $393 million in 2010. The decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels, due to repayment of $1.250 billion of debt during 2011, as well as lower average borrowing rates. Our average borrowing rate was 5.4 percent in 2011 and 6.0 percent in 2010. Our 2010 interest expense included $25 million of write-offs of debt issuance costs, discounts, and the impacts of the early termination of interest rate derivative contracts associated with loan prepayments.54Table of ContentsOther, netOur other, net reflected income of $22 million in 2012, income of $19 million in 2011, and expense of $14 million in 2010. The following are the components of other, net: Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201220112010Interest income $5$7$13Foreign currency losses (18)(12)(9)Net gains (losses) on investments 3727(12)Other expense, net (2)(3)(6) $22$19$(14)During 2012, we recognized gains of $39 million associated with 2012 acquisitions in which we held prior equity interests, which were partially offset by net losses of $2 million related to our investment portfolio. During 2011, we recognized gains of $38 million associated with 2011 acquisitions in which we held prior equity interests, which were partially offset by net losses of $11 million on our investment portfolio. During 2010, we recognized net losses of $12 million relating to the write-down of investments in our portfolio. The acquisition-related gains from previously held investments are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Tax RateThe following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Year EndedDecember 31, 201220112010Reported tax rate (1.0)%31.3 %0.2%Impact of certain receipts/charges* 12.7 %(12.0)%18.0% 11.7 %19.3 %18.2%*These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.The change in our reported tax rate for 2012, as compared to 2011 and 2010, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. In 2012, these receipts and charges include goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits, and litigation- and restructuring-related charges. Our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from an unfavorable court ruling. In addition, the decrease in the tax rate excluding the impact of these receipts and charges in 2012 as compared to 2011 is primarily the result of shifts in the geographic mix of our business. In 2011, these receipts and charges included a gain on our divestiture of the Neurovascular business, a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, other intangible asset impairment charges and restructuring-, litigation- and acquisition-related charges and credits. Our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items, related primarily to a release of valuation allowances resulting from a change in our expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets, changes in various state tax laws, the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from closing agreements with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions, and the finalization of our 2010 U.S. Federal tax return. In 2010, these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, a gain associated with the receipt of an acquisition-related milestone payment, and restructuring-related charges. In 2010, our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items, related primarily to the re-measurement of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable court ruling issued in a similar third-party case and the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar third-party case.We have received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and Boston Scientific Corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years. Subsequent to issuing these Notices, the IRS conceded a portion of its original assessment. The total incremental tax liability now asserted by the IRS for the applicable periods is $1.162 billion plus interest. The primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. In addition, the IRS has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our Transaction Agreement with Abbott Laboratories pertaining to the sale of Guidant's vascular intervention business to Abbott in April 2006. We do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the 55Table of ContentsIRS or its resulting assessment and we believe that the IRS has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated third-party agreement with Abbott. In addition, we believe that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations. We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed, or will timely file, petitions with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the Notices of Deficiency for the tax years in challenge. No payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. However, final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. Our current financial position and results of operations are not impacted by this Act. However, for 2013, our results of operations are expected to be favorably impacted as certain provisions, including the U.S. R&D tax credit, are retroactively reenacted for the year ending December 31, 2012. Refer to Note J - Income Taxes for our 2012 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2012, we had $207 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $39 million invested in money market and government funds and $168 million in interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We also have full access to our $2.000 billion revolving credit facility and $350 million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables, both described below.The following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010: Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201220112010Cash provided by operating activities $1,260$1,008$325Cash provided by (used for) investing activities (579)776(468)Cash used for financing activities (744)(1,728)(508)Operating ActivitiesDuring 2012, we generated $1.260 billion from operating activities, as compared to $1.008 billion in 2011, an increase of $252 million. This increase was driven primarily by accounts receivable and inventory reductions, which generated approximately $103 million; the impact of litigation-related payments of approximately $300 million to the U.S. Department of Justice in 2011; and lower tax-related net cash outflows of approximately $40 million during 2012. Partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower operating profit in 2012 and a $35 million increase in restructuring-related payments as compared to 2011. Our cash provided by operating activities in 2011 also included proceeds of approximately $80 million related to the termination of our outstanding interest rate derivative contracts and the receipt of a $75 million manufacturing cost true-up payment from Abbott in accordance with our supply agreement. During 2011 we generated $683 million more of operating cash flows than in 2010. This increase was driven primarily by lower litigation-related payments of approximately $1.3 billion. Our 2011 litigation-related payments primarily consisted of a payment of approximately $300 million to the U.S. Department of Justice in the first quarter of 2011; during 2010, we made payments of $1.725 billion to Johnson & Johnson related to a patent litigation settlement and received $104 million in connection with a litigation settlement with Medinol. Our cash provided by operating activities in 2011 also included proceeds of approximately $80 million related to the termination of our outstanding interest rate derivative contracts and the receipt of a $75 million manufacturing cost true-up payment from Abbott in accordance with our supply agreement. In 2011 we incurred net tax payments in the amount of $138 million as compared to net tax related receipts of $286 million in 2010. In addition, our 2010 cash flows include the receipt of a $250 million milestone payment from Abbott.56Table of ContentsInvesting ActivitiesDuring 2012, cash used for investing activities was $579 million. Our investing activities included capital expenditures of $226 million and payments for the acquisitions of Cameron Health Inc., Bridgepoint Medical Inc., Rhythmia Medical Inc., and Vessix Vascular Inc., totaling $366 million. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately $300 million during 2013.During 2011, cash provided by investing activities was comprised primarily of proceeds from the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker. We received $1.440 billion of net cash proceeds during 2011 related to the sale of this business. This cash inflow was partially offset by payments of $370 million for acquisitions consummated during 2011; and capital expenditures of $304 million.During 2010, our investing activities were comprised primarily of capital expenditures of $272 million, as well as payments of approximately $200 million to acquire Asthmatx, Inc. and certain other strategic assets.Financing ActivitiesOur cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and repurchases of common stock pursuant to our authorized repurchase programs, discussed in Note L - Stockholders' Equity to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, our financing activities included $146 million of contingent payments primarily associated with the achievement of receiving FDA approval of the S-ICD® system in September 2012.DebtWe had total debt of $4.256 billion as of December 31, 2012 and $4.261 billion as of December 31, 2011. The debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2012 is as follows: (in millions)2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Thereafter TotalSenior notes $600 $1,250 $600 $250 $1,500 $4,200 $600 $1,250 $600 $250 $1,500 $4,200Note:The table above does not include unamortized discounts associated with our senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes.In July 2011, Fitch Ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating to BBB-, an investment-grade rating; and in February 2012, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded our corporate credit rating to Baa3, an investment-grade rating. In addition, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services has maintained an investment-grade corporate credit rating for us since 2009. We believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy. Term Loan and Revolving Credit FacilityDuring 2011, we prepaid the remaining $1.000 billion of our term loan maturities without premium or penalty.In the second quarter of 2012, we established a $2.000 billion revolving credit facility, maturing in April 2017, with a global syndicate of commercial bank and terminated our previous revolving credit facility. Eurodollar and multicurrency loans under the new revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin of between 0.875 percent and 1.475 percent, based on our corporate credit ratings and consolidated leverage ratio (1.275 percent, as of December 31, 2012). In addition, we are required to pay a facility fee based on our credit ratings, consolidated leverage ratio, and the total amount of revolving credit commitments, regardless of usage, under the agreement (0.225 percent, as of December 31, 2012). There were no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2012 or December 31, 2011. 57Table of ContentsOur revolving credit facility agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, as follows: Covenant Requirement Actual as ofDecember 31, 2012 Maximum leverage ratio (1)3.5 times 2.4 timesMinimum interest coverage ratio (2)3.0 times 6.9 times(1)Ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit agreement, for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters.(2)Ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit agreement, to interest expense for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters.The credit agreement provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, through the credit agreement maturity, of up to $500 million in restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses related to our current or future restructuring plans. As of December 31, 2012, we had $357 million of the combined restructuring charge exclusion remaining. Any non-cash charges, as defined by the agreement, are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA. In addition, any cash litigation payments, as defined by the agreement, are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA and any new debt issued to fund any tax deficiency payments is excluded from consolidated total debt, as defined in the agreement, provided that the sum of any excluded cash litigation payments and any new debt issued to fund any tax deficiency payments shall not exceed $2.300 billion in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2012, we had $2.271 billion of the combined legal and debt exclusion remaining. As of and through December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with the required covenants.Any inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers.Senior NotesWe had senior notes outstanding in the amount of $4.200 billion as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. In January 2011, we paid $250 million of our senior notes at maturity.Other ArrangementsWe also maintain a $350 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. In June 2012, we extended the maturity of this facility to June 2013, subject to further extension. There were no amounts borrowed under this facility as of December 31, 2012 or December 31, 2011.We have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries that we account for as sales under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. These agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties, without recourse, of up to approximately $300 million as of December 31, 2012. We have no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. We de-recognized $191 million of receivables as of December 31, 2012 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent, and $390 million as of December 31, 2011 at an average interest rate of 3.3 percent. The European sovereign debt crisis may impact our future ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain Southern European countries. Third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt. This could result in terminations of, or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs. Such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding. Within Italy, Spain, and Portugal the number of days our receivables are outstanding has increased above historical levels. We believe we have adequate allowances for doubtful accounts related to our Italy, Spain and Portugal accounts receivable; however, we will continue to monitor the European economic environment for any collectibility issues related to our outstanding receivables. In addition, we are currently pursuing alternative factoring providers and financing arrangements to mitigate our credit exposure to receivables in this region. During the first quarter of 2011, the Greek government converted a significant portion of our outstanding receivables into bonds, which we monetized during the first quarter and reduced our credit exposure in this country.In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with a Japanese bank that provide for borrowings, promissory notes discounting and receivables factoring of up to 18.5 billion Japanese yen (translated to approximately $214 million as of December 31, 2012). We de-recognized $182 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2012 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent and $188 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2011 at an average interest rate of 1.7 percent. De-recognized accounts and notes 58Table of Contentsreceivable are excluded from trade accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. EquityDuring 2012 and 2011, we received approximately $21 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared $31 million in 2010. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.In March and May 2011, our Board of Directors and stockholders, respectively, approved our 2011 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2011 LTIP), authorizing the issuance of up to 145.6 million shares of our common stock. The 2011 LTIP provides for the grant of restricted or unrestricted common stock, deferred stock units (DSU), options to acquire our common stock, stock appreciation rights, performance awards (market-based and performance-based DSUs) and other stock and non-stock awards. In addition, in July 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion in shares of our common stock and re-approved the repurchase of approximately 37 million shares remaining under a previous share repurchase program. Any repurchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes. During 2012, we repurchased 105 million shares of our common stock for approximately $600 million, pursuant to our share repurchase authorizations. During 2011, we repurchased approximately 82 million shares of our common stock for approximately $492 million. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock in 2010. As of December 31, 2012, we had completed our share repurchase program authorized in 2011 and had remaining 21 million shares authorized under our previous share repurchase programs. Stock-based compensation expense related to our stock equity compensation and ownership plans was $108 million in 2012, $128 million in 2011, and $150 million in 2010. Stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors: the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period; forfeiture levels related to unvested awards; and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.On January 25, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion of our common stock.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2012.

Purchase obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.392 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note J – Income Taxes to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits.With certain of our acquisitions, we acquired in-process research and development projects that require future funding to complete the projects. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory 59Table of Contentsapproval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the in-process research and development projects acquired in 2010-2012 is between $250 million and $350 million and we expect material net cash inflows from the projects in development to commence in 2013 through 2017, following the respective launches of these technologies in the U.S., EMEA and Japan regions. Certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B – Acquisitions to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2012.Legal MattersThe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. Over the years, there has been litigation initiated against us by others, including our competitors, claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. Intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases, but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. Although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies. During recent years, we successfully negotiated closure of several long-standing legal matters and recently received favorable legal rulings in several other matters; however, there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation particularly in the coronary stent market. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.In the normal course of business, product liability, securities and commercial claims are asserted against us. Similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time. We maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims, and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation, and other legal proceedings in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.In addition, like other companies in the medical device industry, we are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which we operate. From time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory, marketing and other business practices. These qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $491 million as of December 31, 2012 and $299 million as of December 31, 2011, and includes estimated costs of settlement, damages and defense. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants.See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We describe these accounting policies in Note A–Significant Accounting Policies to our 2012 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.60Table of ContentsTo prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring management’s judgment that we consider critical:Revenue RecognitionWe allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.Many of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE® Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period. We do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations; therefore, we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available; otherwise, we use our best estimate of selling price. We allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.Inventory ProvisionsWe base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration LiabilitiesWe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including purchased research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the discounted fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations, amortization expense, and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods.We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable, as discussed in Note A - Significant Accounting Policies, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.61Table of ContentsWe generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset (asset group). The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment.Goodwill ValuationWe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the assessment, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. For our 2012 annual impairment assessments, we identified six reporting units within the U.S., including our CRM, Neuromodulation, Endoscopy, Urology/Women's Health, Electrophysiology, and Cardiovascular (consisting of Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions) franchises, which in aggregate make up the U.S. reportable segment. In addition, we identified four international reporting units, including EMEA, Japan, Asia Pacific and the Americas. When allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition. In addition, for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets, which relate to a reporting unit’s operations, and would be considered in determining its fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit.During 2012, 2011, and 2010, we used only the income approach, specifically the DCF method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted WACC as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units’ future expected cash flows.If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value. If we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated, we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate. We would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods, once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test.Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.We continue to identify three reporting units with goodwill that is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM reporting unit, which holds $216 million 62Table of Contentsof remaining allocated goodwill; our U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit, which holds $2.380 billion of allocated goodwill; and our U.S. Neuromodulation reporting unit, which holds $1.266 billion of allocated goodwill, each as of December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, the level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk (with the exception of the U.S. CRM reporting unit, whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value) was approximately seven to 11 percent. During the fourth quarter of 2012, the level of excess fair value over carrying value of our U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit declined as a result of our performance, declines in our market share due to competitive launches, and continued average selling price declines in the U.S. drug-eluting stent (DES) market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. The key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability. Terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges. For example, keeping all other variables constant, a 80 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the U.S. Neuromodulation reporting unit. A 90 basis point decrease in the long term revenue and terminal growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit. An increase in the WACC applied of 70 basis points would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the U.S. Neuromodulation and U.S. Cardiovascular reporting units. Given that the carrying value of the U.S. CRM reporting unit continues to exceed its fair value, any negative changes in the key variables or values associated with this reporting unit would likely require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test in a future reporting period. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management's best estimates, which we believe to be reasonable, but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances. Future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units and/or amortizable intangible assets include, but are not limited to:•decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater-than-expected declines in procedural volumes, pricing pressures, product actions, and/or competitive technology developments;•declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition, an inability to develop or launch new and next-generation products and technology features in line with our commercialization strategies, and market and/or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls;•decreases in our profitability due to an inability to successfully implement and achieve timely and sustainable cost improvement measures consistent with our expectations, increases in our market-participant tax rate, and/or changes in tax laws;•negative developments in intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products or increase our costs to sell certain products;•the level of success of on-going and future research and development efforts, including those related to recent acquisitions, and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products;•the level of success in managing the growth of acquired companies, achieving sustained profitability consistent with our expectations, establishing government and third-party payer reimbursement, and increases in the costs and time necessary to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully;•changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations or divestitures of assets or businesses;•increases in our market-participant risk-adjusted WACC; and•declines in revenue as a result of loss of key members of our sales force and other key personnel.Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in additional impairment charges.63Table of ContentsIncome TaxesWe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of these matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results.We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years.New Accounting PronouncementsStandards ImplementedASC Update No. 2011-04In May 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011-04, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs. Update No. 2011-04 clarifies the FASB's intent about the application of certain existing fair value measurement and disclosure requirements and changes certain principles or requirements for measuring or disclosing information about fair value. It requires, for all Level 3 fair value measurements, new quantitative information about significant unobservable inputs used. We adopted Update No. 2011-04 beginning in our first quarter ended March 31, 2012. The adoption of Update No. 2011-04 did not impact our results of operations or financial position. See Note B - Acquisitions and Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for relevant disclosures.ASC Update No. 2011-05In May 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011-05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income. Update No. 2011-05 requires that net income, items of other comprehensive income and total comprehensive income be presented in one continuous statement or two separate consecutive statements. The amendments in this update also require that reclassifications from other comprehensive income to net income be presented on the face of the financial statements. We adopted Update No. 2011-05 beginning in our first quarter ended March 31, 2012. Update No. 2011-05 is related to presentation only and its adoption did not impact our results of operations or financial position. ASC Update No. 2012-02In July 2012, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2012-02, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Testing Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment. Update No. 2012-02 provides companies with the option to assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicates that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. If the company concludes that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, it is required to determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with Topic 350. If a company concludes otherwise, no further quantitative assessment is required. We adopted Update No. 2012-02 beginning in our third quarter ended September 30, 2012. The adoption of Update No. 2012-02 did not impact our results of operations or financial position. See Note B - Acquisitions and Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for relevant disclosures.Standards to be ImplementedIn December 2011, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (Topic 210), requiring enhanced disclosures about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the statement of financial position or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements. This accounting standard update will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of 2013, at which time we will include the required applicable disclosures. Update No. 2011-11, Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities (Topic 210), will not impact our future results of operations or financial position.64Table of ContentsAdditional InformationUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Used by Boston ScientificTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share that exclude certain amounts and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income (loss) is GAAP net income (loss) and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income per share. To calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP financial measure is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules. Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess its performance relative to its competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from its operating segments' measures of profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to the our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance. We believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by our management for our financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance. The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:Adjusted Net Income (loss) and Adjusted Net Income (loss) per Share•Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges - These amounts represent non-cash write-downs of our goodwill balances attributable to its (a) U.S. Cardiac Rhythm Management reporting unit in the third quarter of 2012, (b) Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) reporting unit recorded in the second quarter of 2012, and (c) U.S. Cardiac Rhythm Management reporting unit recorded in the first quarter of 2011 and non-cash write-downs of certain other intangible asset balances. Management removes the impact of non-cash goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. Management believes this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, these charges are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to the our past operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity.•Acquisition- and divestiture related net credits - These adjustments consist of (a) acquisition-related gains on previously held investments, (b) contingent consideration fair value adjustments, (c) inventory step-up adjustments, (d) due diligence and other fees, exit costs and other costs and credits related to current and prior period acquisitions, (e) gains resulting from business divestitures and (f) fees and separation costs associated with business divestitures. The acquisition-related gains on previously held investments are non-recurring benefits associated with acquisitions completed in the second quarter and fourth quarters of 2012 and the first quarter of 2011. The contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments. The inventory step-up adjustment is a charge related to acquired inventory directly attributable to prior acquisitions and is not indicative of our on-going operations, or on-going cost of products sold. Due diligence, exit costs and other costs and credits include legal, tax, severance and other expenses and credits associated with prior acquisitions that are not representative of on-going operations. The divestiture-related net credits are related to the 65Table of Contentssale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011. The resulting gains are not indicative of future operating performance and are not used by management to assess operating performance. Fees and separation costs represent those associated with our divestiture of its Neurovascular business and are not representative of on-going operations. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Restructuring and restructuring-related charges - These adjustments represent primarily severance, costs to transfer production lines from one facility to another, and other direct costs associated with the Company's 2011 Restructuring plan, 2010 Restructuring plan and Plant Network Optimization program. These expenses are excluded by management in assessing the our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Litigation-related charges - These adjustments include certain significant product liability and other litigation-related charges and credits. These amounts are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Discrete tax items - These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions, which were initially established in prior periods as a result of intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- or litigation-related charges (credits). These adjustments do not reflect expected on-going operating results. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Amortization expense - Amortization expense is a non-cash charge and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in its credit facility agreement. Management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. Management believes this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, amortization expense is excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation. Accordingly, management has excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity.Regional and Divisional Revenue Growth Rates Excluding the Impact of Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates•Changes in foreign currency exchange rates - The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict. Accordingly, management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.Adjusted net income (loss), adjusted net income (loss) per share and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than us, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.Rule 10b5-1 Trading PlansPeriodically, certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and our own Stock Trading Policy. A Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula(s) for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including the exercise and sale of stock options, and is entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non-public information about the company.66Table of ContentsManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingAs the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control–Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2012, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ Michael F. Mahoney /s/ Jeffrey D. Capello Michael F. Mahoney Jeffrey D. Capello President and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and ChiefFinancial Officer 67Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Scientific CorporationWe have audited Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 22, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLPBoston, MassachusettsFebruary 22, 201368Table of ContentsITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $4.411 billion as of December 31, 2012 and $4.297 billion as of December 31, 2011. We recorded $121 million of other assets and $57 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2012, as compared to $87 million of other assets and $131 million of other liabilities as of December 31, 2011. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $270 million as of December 31, 2012 and $230 million as of December 31, 2011. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $319 million as of December 31, 2012 and by $281 million as of December 31, 2011. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operations.Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of $850 million in the first quarter of 2011 to convert fixed-rate debt associated with certain of our senior notes into floating-rate debt, and subsequently terminated these hedges during the third quarter of 2011. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2012 and December 31, 2011. As of December 31, 2012, $4.250 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates, representing approximately 100 percent of our total debt.See Note E – Fair Value Measurements to our 2012 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding our derivative financial instruments.69Table of ContentsReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Scientific CorporationWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Boston Scientific Corporation at December 31, 2012 and 2011, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2012, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2012, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 22, 2013 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLPBoston, MassachusettsFebruary 22, 201370Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:42:23.274271

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Executive SummaryFinancial Highlights and TrendsIn 2013, we generated net sales of $7.143 billion, as compared to $7.249 billion in 2012, a decrease of $106 million, or one percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $156 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2013 as compared to 2012 and sales related to our divested Neurovascular business declined $64 million in 2013. Refer to Note C - Divestitures included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on the Neurovascular divestiture. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $114 million, or two percent, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to constant currency increases in net sales from our Endoscopy business of $89 million, from our Neuromodulation business of $87 million, and from our Peripheral Interventions business of $43 million. These increases were partially offset by a constant currency decrease in net sales from our Interventional Cardiology business of $124 million.1 Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our sales results.Our reported net loss in 2013 was $121 million, or $0.09 per share. Our reported results for 2013 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges; restructuring- and litigation-related charges; debt extinguishment charges; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $1.112 billion, or $0.82 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2013 was $991 million, or $0.73 per share1.Our reported net loss in 2012 was $4.068 billion, or $2.89 per share. Our reported results for 2012 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits; restructuring- and litigation-related charges; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $5.001 billion, or $3.55 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2012 was $933 million, or $0.66 per share1. The following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) to those adjusted results considered by management. Refer to Results of Operations for a discussion of each reconciling item: Year Ended December 31, 2013 Tax Impact per in millions, except per share data Pre-Tax Impact After-Tax share GAAP net income (loss) $(223) $102 $(121) $(0.09) Non-GAAP adjustments: Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 476 (8) 468 0.35*Acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges 1 3 4 0.00*Restructuring-related charges 124 (36) 88 0.07*Litigation-related charges 221 (72) 149 0.11*Debt extinguishment charges 70 (26) 44 0.03*Discrete tax items — (7) (7) (0.01)*Amortization expense 410 (44) 366 0.27*Adjusted net income $1,079 $(88) $991 $0.73 * Assumes dilution of 19.5 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2013 for all or a portion of these non-GAAP adjustments.1 Sales growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates and net income and net income per share excluding certain items required by GAAP are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Refer to Additional Information in this Item 7 for a discussion of management’s use of these non-GAAP financial measures.Cash generated by operating activities was $1.082 billion in 2013, as compared to $1.260 billion in 2012. Our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth and returning value to shareholders by buying back shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase authorizations discussed in Note L - Stockholders' Equity to our 2013 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. During 2013, we used $500 million of cash generated from operations to repurchase approximately 51 million shares of our common stock, as compared to 2012 in which $600 million of cash generated from operations was used to repurchase approximately 105 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2013, we had total debt of $4.240 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $217 million and working capital of $1.187 billion. We hold investment-grade ratings with all three major credit-rating agencies. We believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy. 38Business and Market OverviewCardiovascularInterventional Cardiology Our Interventional Cardiology division develops, manufactures and markets technologies for diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders. Product offerings include coronary stents, including drug-eluting and bare metal stent systems, balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, crossing and re-entry devices for the treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels, diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging systems. In the first quarter of 2013, we received CE Mark approval and launched our Promus PREMIER™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System in Europe and other select geographies. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we received FDA approval and launched Promus PREMIER™ in the U.S. The Promus PREMIER™ Stent System is designed to provide physicians improved drug-eluting stent performance in treating patients with coronary artery disease, featuring unique customized platinum chromium alloy stent architecture and an enhanced stent delivery system. We have also received CE Mark approval for our next generation SYNERGY™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System featuring an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating and have commenced a limited commercial launch. We expect to expand the launch in Europe in the first half of 2014. The SYNERGY Stent is unique in that its proprietary polymer and everolimus drug coating dissipate by three months. This innovation has the potential to improve post-implant vessel healing and eliminate long-term polymer exposure, a possible cause of late adverse events. We have completed patient enrollment in the EVOLVE II clinical trial, which is designed to further assess the safety and effectiveness of the SYNERGY Stent System and support U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Japanese regulatory approvals for this technology.Our worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products were $1.997 billion for the year ended December 31, 2013, or approximately 28 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2013. Our worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products decreased $182 million, or eight percent, in 2013, as compared to 2012. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $58 million negative impact on our Interventional Cardiology net sales in 2013, as compared to 2012, net sales of these products decreased $124 million, or six percent. This decrease was primarily due to lower coronary stent system sales, partially offset by higher sales of our non-stent Interventional Cardiology products.Our coronary stent system sales represent a significant portion of our Interventional Cardiology net sales. The following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales: Year Ended Year Ended(in millions) December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 U.S. International Total U.S. International TotalDrug-eluting $448 $665 $1,113 $557 $720 $1,277Bare-metal 19 45 64 24 62 86 $467 $710 $1,177 $581 $782 $1,363Worldwide net sales of our coronary stent systems, with the inclusion of bare-metal stent systems, were $1.177 billion or approximately 16 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2013. Our worldwide net sales of these products decreased $186 million, or 14 percent, in 2013, as compared to 2012. Our U.S. net sales of drug-eluting stent systems decreased $109 million, or 20 percent, in 2013, as compared to 2012. This decrease was primarily related to lower market share due to competitive launches in 2012, continued average selling price declines in the U.S. DES market as a result of continued competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes. Our international drug-eluting stent system net sales decreased $55 million, or eight percent, in 2013, as compared to the previous year, due to continued lower market share related to competitive launches. Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. We believe that we will continue to maintain a strong position within the worldwide coronary stent market for a variety of reasons, including:•the performance benefits of our current and future technology;•the strength of our pipeline of drug-eluting stent products, which has shown favorable results in clinical trials to date;•the breadth and depth of our interventional cardiology product portfolio; 39•the broad and consistent long-term results of our clinical trials;•our overall position in the interventional medical device market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force;•the strength of our clinical, selling, marketing and manufacturing capabilities; and•our increased presence and investment in rapidly growing emerging markets.However, a decline in net sales from our drug-eluting stent systems could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results. Significant variables that may impact the size of the drug-eluting stent market and our position within this market include, but are not limited to:•the impact of competitive pricing pressure on average selling prices of drug-eluting stent systems available in the market;•the impact and outcomes of on-going and future clinical trials involving our or our competitors’ products, including those trials sponsored by our competitors or other third parties, or perceived product performance of our or our competitors’ products;•new product launches by our competitors;•our ability to timely and successfully launch new or next-generation products and technologies, in line with our commercialization strategies;•physician and patient confidence in our current and next-generation technology;•changes in the overall number of percutaneous coronary intervention procedures performed, drug-eluting stent penetration rates and the average number of stents used per procedure;•delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; and•the outcome of intellectual property litigation.In January 2011, we completed the acquisition of Sadra Medical, Inc. Through our acquisition of Sadra, we have developed a fully repositionable and retrievable device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis. The Lotus™ Valve System consists of a stent-mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve. The low-profile delivery system and introducer sheath are designed to enable accurate positioning, repositioning and retrieval at any time prior to release of the aortic valve implant. In April 2013, we completed enrollment in the REPRISE II clinical trial to evaluate the safety and performance of the Lotus™ Valve System. In October 2013, we received CE Mark approval and launched the Lotus ™ Valve System in Europe.In 2013 and 2012, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges related to the Sadra in-process research and development intangible assets. Refer to Results of Operations for further details. In March 2011, we completed the acquisition of Atritech, Inc. Atritech developed a novel device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. The WATCHMAN® Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology is the first device proven in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to anticoagulant drugs, and is marketed in CE Mark countries. In the U.S., we completed the PREVAIL trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the WATCHMAN® device in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation versus long-term warfarin therapy. In the first half of 2013, we submitted the results of the US IDE trial, PREVAIL, to the FDA. The FDA Circulatory System Device Panel met in December of 2013 and voted favorably by a majority, Yes: 13, No:1, that there is reasonable assurance the device is safe, there is reasonable assurance of efficacy, and the benefits of the WATCHMAN® LAA Closure Device outweigh the risks. We expect FDA approval of the device in the first half of 2014. We are leveraging expertise from both our Electrophysiology and Interventional Cardiology businesses in the commercialization of the WATCHMAN® LAA Closure Device. Peripheral Interventions Our PI product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and other devices used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $789 million in 2013, as compared to $774 million in 2012, an increase of $15 million, or two percent. Excluding the $28 million of negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide PI net sales increased $43 million, or six percent, in 2013 as compared to 2012. The year-over-year increase in worldwide PI net sales was primarily driven by growth in our core PI franchise as a result of new product launches in stents and balloons, as well as the launch of the Vessix renal denervation system in Europe. 40During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed the acquisition of Vessix, a developer of catheter-based renal denervation systems for the treatment of uncontrolled hypertension. Through the acquisition of Vessix, we added a second generation, highly differentiated technology to our hypertension strategy and launched this technology in Europe in May 2013. We plan to carefully examine the forthcoming available data from a competitor’s recently completed U.S. pivotal trial in renal denervation for treatment-resistant hypertension, with respect to which the competitor announced in January 2014 that it failed to meet its primary efficacy endpoint. We plan to work collaboratively with the scientific community to determine the next steps for the design of our Vessix clinical program.Rhythm ManagementCardiac Rhythm ManagementOur CRM division develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices including implantable cardioverter defibrillator systems and pacemaker systems that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities. Worldwide net sales of our CRM products of $1.886 billion represented approximately 27 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2013. Our worldwide CRM net sales decreased $22 million, or one percent, in 2013, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates our 2013 worldwide CRM net sales decreased $8 million, or less than one percent, as compared to 2012. Our U.S. CRM net sales increased $3 million, or less than one percent, in 2013 as compared to 2012. Our international CRM net sales decreased $25 million, or three percent, in 2013, as compared to 2012, and included a $14 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The following are the components of our worldwide CRM net sales: Year Ended Year Ended(in millions) December 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 U.S. International Total U.S. International TotalICD systems $850 $505 $1,355 $858 $521 $1,379Pacemaker systems 267 264 531 256 273 529CRM products $1,117 $769 $1,886 $1,114 $794 $1,908The reduction in our worldwide CRM net sales during 2013 as compared to 2012 was principally the result of a decrease in net sales of our defibrillator systems due to the impact of average selling price pressures driven by governmental, competitive and other pricing pressures partially offset by slight increases in unit volumes. Our pacemaker system net sales increased less than one percent during 2013 as compared to 2012 due to the continued strong performance of our INGENIO family of pacemaker systems.During the second quarter of 2012, we completed the acquisition of Cameron Health, Inc. Cameron developed the world's first and only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator, the S-ICD® System, which we believe is a differentiated technology that will provide us the opportunity to both increase our market share in the existing ICD market and expand that market over time. The S-ICD® system has received CE Mark and FDA approval. We became supply constrained in early March 2013 and were only able to provide a very limited supply of S-ICD systems during the second and third quarters of 2013. We continued to make progress in our efforts to enhance the S-ICD supply chain; and in the fourth quarter of 2013 we were able to resume our launch of our S-ICD system.Net sales from our CRM products represent a significant source of our overall net sales. Therefore, increases or decreases in our CRM net sales could have a significant impact on the results of our consolidated operations. Variables that may impact the size of the CRM market and/or our share of that market include, but are not limited to:•our ability to timely and successfully acquire or develop and launch new or next-generation competitive products and technologies worldwide, in line with our commercialization strategies, including the S-ICD® system;•new product launches by our competitors;•the on-going impact of physician alignment to hospitals, government investigations and audits of hospitals, and other market and economic conditions on the overall number of procedures performed and average selling prices;•our ability to retain and attract key members of our CRM sales force and other key CRM personnel; 41•the ability of CRM manufacturers to maintain the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community, the referring physician community and prospective patients in CRM technologies;•future product field actions or new physician advisories issued by us or our competitors;•variations in clinical results, reliability or product performance of our and our competitors’ products; and•delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies.During 2013, 2012 and 2011, we have recorded goodwill impairment charges related to our CRM business unit. Refer to Results of Operations for further discussion of these charges.ElectrophysiologyOur Electrophysiology business develops less-invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart. Our leading products include the Blazer™ line of ablation catheters, designed to deliver enhanced performance and responsiveness. Our Blazer™ line includes our next generation Blazer™ Prime ablation catheter, and our Blazer™ Open-Irrigated Catheter, launched in select European countries. Worldwide net sales of our Electrophysiology products were $155 million in 2013, as compared to $147 million in 2012, an increase of approximately $8 million, or five percent. Excluding the $2 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide Electrophysiology net sales increased $10 million, or seven percent, in 2013, as compared to 2012. The increase in worldwide Electrophysiology net sales was due to the acquisition of the electrophysiology business of C.R. Bard Inc. which produced $15 million of sales during the fourth quarter of 2013.During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed the acquisition of Rhythmia Medical, Inc., a developer of next-generation mapping and navigation solutions for use in cardiac catheter ablations and other electrophysiology procedures, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. We received CE Mark approval for the Rhythmia technology during the second quarter of 2013 and received FDA approval during July 2013, and expect to launch the product in 2014. On November 1, 2013, we completed the acquisition of the electrophysiology business of C.R. Bard Inc. (Bard EP). We believe that this transaction brings a strong commercial team and complementary portfolio of ablation catheters, diagnostic tools, and electrophysiology recording systems, and will allow us to better serve the global Electrophysiology market through a more comprehensive portfolio offering and sales infrastructure. We believe that the Rhythmia and Bard EP acquisitions, as well as our other expected product launches, will help to position us to participate more competitively in the fast-growing Electrophysiology market.MedSurgEndoscopyOur Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $1.300 billion in 2013, as compared to $1.252 billion in 2012, an increase of $48 million, or four percent. Excluding the $41 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide Endoscopy net sales increased $89 million, or seven percent, in 2013, as compared to 2012. This performance was primarily the result of growth across several of our key product franchises, including our hemostasis franchise on the continued adoption and utilization of our Resolution Clip for gastrointestinal bleeding; our biliary device franchise driven by our endoscopic ultrasound platform and recent launches within our biliary access and retrieval product lines; our metal stent franchise driven by our WallFlex® product family; and improved adoption of the Alair® Bronchial Thermoplasty system.In 2010, we completed our acquisition of Asthmatx, Inc., which added to our Endoscopy portfolio a less-invasive, catheter-based bronchial thermoplasty procedure for the treatment of severe persistent asthma. The Alair® Bronchial Thermoplasty System, developed by Asthmatx, has CE Mark, China Food and Drug Administration and U.S. FDA approval and is the first device-based asthma treatment approved by the FDA. Beginning January 1, 2013, the America Medical Association Current Procedural Terminology editorial panel assigned category I CPT codes specifically for bronchial thermoplasty. The Category I CPT procedure codes are recognized by all public and private health insurance payers in the United States, which will allow physicians and hospitals to seek reimbursement for bronchial thermoplasty procedures. In addition, during the third quarter of 2013, the five-year data from the AIR2 clinical trial were published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, which showed that the Alair System provided long-term asthma control, demonstrated by a sustained reduction in the rate of severe exacerbations and emergency room visits over a five year period after treatment. We expect that the Alair technology will continue to strengthen our existing offering of pulmonary devices and contribute to future sales growth and diversification of the Endoscopy business. 42Urology and Women’s HealthOur Urology and Women’s Health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and gynecological disorders. Our worldwide net sales of these products were $505 million in 2013, as compared to $500 million in 2012, an increase of approximately $5 million, or one percent. Excluding the $12 million negative impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide Urology and Women's Health net sales increased $17 million, or three percent, in 2013, as compared to 2012. The increase in worldwide Urology and Women's Health net sales was primarily due to new product launches and growth in the international business as a result of our global commercial expansion.NeuromodulationOur Neuromodulation business offers the Precision® and Precision SpectraTM Spinal Cord Stimulator systems, used for the management of chronic pain. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products were $453 million in 2013, as compared to $367 million in 2012, an increase of $86 million, or 23 percent. Excluding the negative impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of $1 million, our Neuromodulation worldwide net sales in 2013 grew 24 percent as compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily a result of strong sales of our Precision Spectra System. We received CE Mark approval for the Precision Spectra System during the fourth quarter of 2012 and we commenced our U.S. commercial launch of the device during the first quarter of 2013 following FDA approval. The Precision Spectra System is the world's first and only SCS system with 32 contacts and 32 dedicated power sources and is designed to provide improved pain relief to a wide range of patients who suffer from chronic pain.During the third quarter of 2012, we received CE Mark approval for use of our Vercise™ Deep Brain Stimulation System for the treatment of Parkinson's disease in Europe, and we began our U.S. pivotal trial for the treatment of Parkinson's disease during the second quarter of 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we received CE Mark approval for use of our Vercise™ DBS System for the treatment of intractable primary and secondary dystonia. We believe we have an exciting opportunity in DBS with the Vercise™ DBS System which is designed to selectively stimulate targeted areas of the brain to customize therapy for patients and minimize side effects of unwanted stimulation. Emerging MarketsAs part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, described in Item 1 of this Annual Report, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in Emerging Markets. We define Emerging Markets as including certain developing countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors, and our global capabilities, which currently include 20 countries. We are seeking to expand our presence and strengthen relationships in order to grow net sales and market share within our Emerging Markets, and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities. Our Emerging Markets revenue was approximately eight percent of our consolidated net sales in 2013. Restructuring InitiativesOn an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and we assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital and our people that we believe are important to our long-term success. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. These initiatives are described below, and additional information can be found in Results of Operations and Note H – Restructuring-related Activities to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.2014 Restructuring PlanOn October 22, 2013, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a restructuring initiative (the 2014 Restructuring plan). The 2014 Restructuring plan is intended to build on the progress we have made to address financial pressures in a changing global marketplace, further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiency and support new growth investments. Key activities under the plan include continued implementation of our ongoing Plant Network Optimization strategy, continued focus on driving operational efficiencies and ongoing business and commercial model changes. The PNO strategy is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities. Other activities involve rationalizing organizational reporting structures to streamline various functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align resources to business strategies and marketplace dynamics. These activities were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2015. 43We estimate that the 2014 Restructuring plan will reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $150 million to $200 million exiting 2015, and we expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. We estimate that the implementation of the 2014 Restructuring plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $175 million to $225 million, of which approximately $160 million to $210 million is expected to result in future cash outlays. Refer to Results of Operations for further details on our restructuring charges.2011 Restructuring PlanOn July 26, 2011, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a restructuring initiative (the 2011 Restructuring plan) designed to strengthen operational effectiveness and efficiencies, increase competitiveness and support new investments, thereby increasing shareholder value. Key activities under the 2011 Restructuring plan included standardizing and automating certain processes and activities; relocating select administrative and functional activities; rationalizing organizational reporting structures; leveraging preferred vendors; and other efforts to eliminate inefficiency. Among these efforts, we expanded our ability to deliver best-in-class global shared services for certain functions and divisions at several locations in emerging markets. This action was intended to enable us to grow our global commercial presence in key geographies and take advantage of many cost-reducing and productivity-enhancing opportunities. In addition, we undertook efforts to streamline various corporate functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies. On January 25, 2013, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expansion of our 2011 Restructuring plan. The Expansion was intended to further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiencies and support new investments. Key activities under the Expansion included further initiatives to: standardize and automate certain processes and activities; relocate select administrative and functional activities; rationalize organizational reporting structures; expand shared services; and align expenses to revenues within certain divisions and geographic regions. In addition, they included further efforts to streamline various corporate functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align corporate resources to our key business strategies. The total 2011 Restructuring plan, including the Expansion (the Total Program), reduced gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $360 million exiting 2013. A substantial portion of the Total Program savings were reinvested in targeted areas for future growth, including strategic growth initiatives and emerging markets. Key activities under the Total Program were substantially completed by the end of 2013. Refer to Results of Operations for further details on our restructuring charges.Neurovascular DivestitureIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.5 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion during 2011, $10 million during 2012, $30 million during 2013 and received the final $10 million in January 2014. After the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker, we provided transitional services through a transition services agreement, and also manufactured and supplied products to Stryker through a supply agreement. These transition services and supply agreements substantially ended during 2013. We recorded Neurovascular revenue of $58 million during 2013, $122 million during 2012 and $141 million during 2011. Our sales related to our divested Neurovascular business have declined as the various transition services and supply agreements have terminated. We do not expect revenue from our divested Neurovascular business to be significant in 2014. Divestiture-related gains or charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. See Results of Operations and Note C - Divestitures for additional information.Healthcare ReformThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. Certain provisions of the law have yet to be implemented and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not yet fully understood; therefore, it is unclear what the full impact will be from the law. The legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. In 2013, we recorded $73 million within our selling, general and administrative expenses. Other provisions of this law, including Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and will place a significant emphasis on clinical and economic data to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchases.Any changes in government policies that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes in countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally. 44We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations (ACOs) continue to take shape globally. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan and Europe and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for our products, which in turn may influence a hospital’s or physician's selection of products used to treat patients. In Japan, the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years, which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those procedures.Results of OperationsNet SalesEffective as of January 1, 2013, we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units. We have three new global reportable segments comprised of Cardiovascular, Rhythm Management, and MedSurg. We have restated the 2012 and 2011 information to conform to our new segment presentation.We manage our global businesses on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. Management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using standard internal currency exchange rates held constant for each year. The following table provides our worldwide net sales by global business and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. Net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and net sales from divested businesses are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Refer to Additional Information of this Item 7 for a further discussion of management’s use of this non-GAAP financial measure. 2013 versus 20122012 versus 2011 Year EndedDecember 31,As ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasisAs ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasis(in millions)201320122011Interventional Cardiology$1,997$2,179$2,495(8)%(6)%(13)%(11)%Peripheral Interventions7897747312%6%6%8%Cardiovascular2,7862,9533,226(6)%(3)%(8)%(7)% Cardiac Rhythm Management1,8861,9082,087(1)%—%(9)%(7)%Electrophysiology1551471475%7%—%1%Rhythm Management2,0412,0552,234(1)%—%(8)%(6)% Endoscopy1,3001,2521,1874%7%5%7%Urology and Women’s Health5055004981%3%—%1%Neuromodulation45336733623%24%9%9%MedSurg2,2582,1192,0217%9%5%6%Subtotal Core Businesses7,0857,1277,481(1)%2%(5)%(3)%Divested Businesses58122141N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide$7,143$7,249$7,622(1)%1%(5)%(3)%The constant currency growth rates in the table above can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note O - Segment Reporting to our 2013 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Growth rates are based on actual, non-rounded amounts and may not recalculate precisely. Refer to Executive Summary for further discussion of our net sales and a comparison of our 2013 and 2012 net sales. 45In 2012, we generated net sales of $7.249 billion, as compared to $7.622 billion in 2011, a decrease of $373 million, or five percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $123 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2012 as compared to 2011 and sales related to our divested Neurovascular business declined $19 million in 2012. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales decreased $232 million, or three percent, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was due primarily to constant currency declines in net sales from our Interventional Cardiology business of $266 million primarily as a result of lower market share due to competitive launches in 2012, average selling price declines in the DES market as a result of competitive pressures and declines in procedural volumes; and declines in our CRM net sales of $145 million due to lower procedural volumes as a result of a contraction in the ICD market, lower average selling prices, and lower volumes. These decreases were partially offset by constant currency increases in net sales during 2012 from our Endoscopy business of $84 million, from our Peripheral Interventions business of $56 million, and net sales from our Neuromodulation business of $32 million, as compared to 2011.Gross ProfitOur gross profit was $4.969 billion in 2013, $4.900 billion in 2012, and $4.963 billion in 2011. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased to 69.6 percent in 2013, as compared to 67.6 percent in 2012 and 65.1 percent in 2011. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period: Year EndedDecember 31, 20132012Gross profit - prior year67.6 %65.1 %Neurovascular divestiture0.5 %— %Manufacturing cost reductions1.9 %1.4 %Transition-related inventory charges(0.1)%0.7 %All other, including other inventory charges, other period expense and net impact of foreign currency0.6 %0.7 %Sales mix and pricing(0.9)%(0.3)%Gross profit - current year69.6 %67.6 %The increase in our gross profit margin for 2013, as compared to 2012, is primarily the result of cost reductions from our restructuring and process improvement programs. Our gross profit margin was also positively impacted by lower sales related to our divested businesses, as these sales are at significantly lower gross profit margins. In addition, during the second quarter of 2013, we recorded a $16 million credit to cost of products sold related to the final retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our PROMUS® supply arrangement with Abbott for historical purchases of PROMUS® stent systems. This credit is included in the ""all other"" caption in the table above. Partially offsetting these factors was the negative impact of pricing and sales mix related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products. The main factor contributing to the increase in our gross profit margin during 2012, as compared to 2011, was the result of cost reductions from our restructuring and process improvement programs. Our gross margin was negatively impacted by declines in average selling prices related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products; however, these declines were largely offset by the full conversion to our internally-developed and self-manufactured next-generation PROMUS® Element™ stent system during 2012. Our PROMUS® Element™ stent system has significantly higher gross margins than the prior generation PROMUS® stent system, which was supplied to us by Abbott Laboratories. Additionally, affecting our 2012 to 2011 comparison of gross margin was the impact of a one-time $50 million credit to cost of products sold, related to a two-year retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our PROMUS® supply arrangement with Abbott and product transition-related inventory charges of $54 million recorded in 2011. 46Operating ExpensesThe following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 % of Net % of Net % of Net(in millions) $ Sales $ Sales $ SalesSelling, general and administrative expenses 2,674 37.4 2,535 35.0 2,487 32.6Research and development expenses 861 12.0 886 12.2 895 11.7Royalty expense 140 2.0 153 2.1 172 2.3Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) ExpensesIn 2013, our SG&A expenses increased $139 million, or five percent, as compared to 2012, and were 240 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. This increase was driven primarily by our increased investment related to acquisitions, strategic growth initiatives, and our expansion efforts in emerging markets, as well as $73 million of expense associated with the new excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices that went into effect January 1, 2013. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. In 2012, our SG&A expenses increased $48 million, or two percent, as compared to 2011, and were 240 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. This increase was driven primarily by continued investments in acquisitions and in commercial resources and infrastructure for global expansion, particularly in emerging markets, and a non-recurring asset impairment charge as a result of a program termination. Also contributing to the year-over-year increase was a benefit recorded in 2011 as a result of a reversal of previously established allowances for doubtful accounts against long-outstanding receivables in Greece. These increases in SG&A were partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Research and Development (R&D) ExpensesIn 2013, our R&D expenses decreased $25 million, or approximately three percent, as compared to 2012, and were 20 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease was due primarily to our continued focus on cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs and the benefits from our strategy to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient. Partially offsetting the decrease was R&D funding for our acquisitions. We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth.In 2012, our R&D expenses decreased $9 million, or approximately one percent, as compared to 2011, and were 50 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. The slight decrease in overall spending in 2012 was due to cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs, partially offset by increased R&D funding for our acquisitions. Royalty ExpenseIn 2013, our royalty expense decreased $13 million, or nine percent, as compared to 2012, and was ten basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to lower sales of our royalty-bearing products within our Interventional Cardiology business.In 2012, our royalty expense decreased $19 million, or 11 percent, as compared to 2011, and was 20 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to lower sales of our royalty-bearing products within our Interventional Cardiology business.Amortization ExpenseOur amortization expense was $410 million in 2013, as compared to $395 million in 2012, an increase of $15 million or four percent. This increase was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of Bridgepoint, Rhythmia, and Vessix, which all took place in the fourth quarter of 2012 and electrophysiology business or C.R. Bard, Inc., which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013. 47Amortization expense was $395 million in 2012, as compared to $421 million in 2011, a decrease of $26 million or six percent. This decrease was due primarily to certain intangible assets associated with our acquisition of Guidant Corporation in 2006 reaching the end of their useful lives during the second quarter of 2011.Amortization expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Goodwill Impairment ChargesEffective as of January 1, 2013, we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units. Our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes. We identified the following new global reporting units effective as of January 1, 2013: Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Women's Health, and Neuromodulation. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates for further discussion of the reorganization and the resulting global reporting units. The discussion below for 2013 relates to our global business reporting units and for 2012 and prior periods, relates to our former regional reporting units. For our 2012 and prior impairment assessments, we identified (i) six reporting units within the U.S., which included our CRM, Neuromodulation, Endoscopy, Urology and Women's Health, Electrophysiology, and Cardiovascular (consisting of Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions) franchises, which in aggregate made up the U.S. reportable segment and (ii) four international reporting units, including EMEA (consisting of Europe, Middle East and Africa), Japan, Asia Pacific and the Americas. 2013 ChargeWe test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. Following our reorganization from regions to global business units and our reallocation of goodwill on a relative fair value basis, we conducted the first step of the goodwill impairment test for all new global reporting units as of January 1, 2013. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units. The fair value of each new global reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, with the exception of the global CRM reporting unit. The global CRM reporting unit carrying value exceeded its fair value primarily due to the carrying value of its amortizable intangible assets. The carrying value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to the global CRM reporting unit was $4.636 billion as of January 1, 2013. In accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles—Goodwill and Other (Topic 350), we tested the global CRM amortizable intangible assets for impairment in conjunction with the interim goodwill impairment test of our global CRM reporting unit. We performed the impairment analysis of the amortizable intangible assets on an undiscounted cash flow basis, and concluded that these assets were not impaired.The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value. We performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test on the global CRM reporting unit and recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $423 million ($421 million after-tax) to write-down the goodwill to its implied fair value as of January 1, 2013. The primary driver of this impairment charge was our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units as of January 1, 2013, which changed the composition of our reporting units. As a result of the reorganization, any goodwill allocated to the global CRM reporting unit was no longer supported by the cash flows of other businesses. Under our former reporting unit structure, the goodwill allocated to our regional reporting units was supported by the cash flows from all businesses in each international region. The hypothetical tax structure of the global CRM business and the global CRM business discount rate applied were also contributing factors to the goodwill impairment charge. We finalized the second step of the global CRM goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of 2013 and determined that no adjustments to the charge were required. After recording the impairment charge in the first quarter of 2013, there was no remaining goodwill allocated to the global CRM reporting unit. The goodwill impairment charge taken during the first quarter of 2013 was determined on a global CRM basis pursuant to our new organizational structure. We used the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of the global CRM reporting unit. We completed a DCF model associated with our new global CRM business, including the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, tax attributes, the terminal value growth rate of approximately two percent and the appropriate market-participant risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital (WACC) of approximately 12 percent. 48In the second quarter of 2013, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value except CRM, for which no goodwill remains. Therefore, it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test. We have identified our global Neuromodulation reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. Our global Neuromodulation reporting unit holds $1.356 billion of allocated goodwill. The level of excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit identified during our annual goodwill impairment test was approximately 16 percent. Future changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global CRM. Further, the recoverability of our CRM-related amortizable intangibles ($4.374 billion globally as of December 31, 2013) is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global CRM business performance. The $4.374 billion of CRM-related amortizable intangibles are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods. An impairment of a material portion of our CRM-related amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates of this Item 7 for further discussion of our CRM-related intangible assets.2012 ChargesDuring the second quarter of 2012, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded that the goodwill within our former EMEA reporting unit was impaired and recorded a charge of $3.602 billion ($3.579 billion after-tax). As a result of revised estimates developed during our annual strategic planning process and analysis performed in conjunction with our annual goodwill impairment test, we concluded that the revenue growth rates projected for the EMEA reporting unit were slightly lower than our previous estimates primarily driven by macro-economic factors and our performance in the European market. We updated short-term operating projections based on our most recent strategic plan for EMEA prepared by management. We reduced the EMEA long-term growth rates and terminal value growth rate projections and increased the discount rate within our 15-year DCF model for EMEA by approximately 100 basis points due to increased risk associated with our projections in this market primarily as a result of economic uncertainty in Europe. In addition, our expectations for future growth and profitability were lowered as compared to our previous estimates and reflected declines in average selling prices and volume pressures due to austerity measures.In the third quarter of 2012, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test and recorded a non-cash $748 million (pre- and after-tax) charge associated with our former U.S. CRM reporting unit, primarily driven by a reduction in the estimated size of the U.S. CRM market, related adjustments to our business and other competitive factors, which led to lower projected U.S. CRM results compared to prior forecasts. The U.S. CRM market is dynamic, highly competitive and difficult to forecast; in the third quarter of 2012, we lowered our projections for the U.S. CRM market size and our future revenue levels within this market, primarily to reflect changes in expectations of average selling prices and unit growth, adjustments to our business and other competitive factors. The increased pricing pressure and lower unit volumes were primarily due to physician alignment with hospitals, efforts to reduce health care costs, focus on appropriate device usage, replacement volumes and competition, and were more impactful to the U.S. CRM business than previously estimated. In addition, we adjusted certain elements of our business and shifted investments to focus on areas expected to provide the highest future growth and financial return. As a result of these factors, we reduced the compound annual revenue growth rate of our 15 year DCF model for the U.S. CRM reporting unit by approximately 250 basis points. 2011 ChargeBased on market information that became available to us toward the end of the first quarter of 2011, we concluded that there was a reduction in the estimated size of the U.S. ICD market, which led to lower projected U.S. CRM results compared to prior forecasts and created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our former U.S. CRM business unit. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies and recorded a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge of $697 million, on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis, associated with this business unit during the first quarter of 2011. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. Goodwill impairment charges do not impact our debt covenants or our cash flows, and are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. 49Intangible Asset Impairment Charges2013 ChargesDuring the third quarter of 2013, we performed our annual impairment test of all in-process research and development projects,and our indefinite lived core technology assets, and recorded no impairments based on the results of our testing. These indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, in accordance with U.S. GAAP and our accounting policies described in Note A – Significant Accounting Policies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report.During the second quarter of 2013 as a result of revised estimates developed in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process and annual goodwill impairment test, we performed an interim impairment test of our in-process research and development projects associated with certain of our acquisitions. Based on the results of our impairment analyses, we revised our expectations of the market size related to Sadra, and the resulting timing and amount of future revenue and cash flows associated with the technology acquired from Sadra. As a result of these changes, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $51 million to write-down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value during the second quarter of 2013. During the second quarter of 2013, we also recorded an additional $2 million intangible asset impairment charge associated with changes in the amount of the expected cash flows related to certain other acquired in-process research and development projects.2012 ChargesDuring the third quarter of 2012, we performed our annual impairment test of all in-process research and development projects, and our indefinite lived core technology assets. Based on the results of our annual test, we recorded total impairment charges of $13 million to write-down the balances of certain in-process projects to their fair value. These charges were primarily due to increased expectations in the cost to bring an in-process project to market in a certain geographic region and lower future revenue expectations associated with an in-process project.During the second quarter of 2012, as a result of revised estimates developed in conjunction with our annual strategic planning process and annual goodwill impairment test, we performed an interim impairment test of our in-process research and development projects associated with our acquisition of Sadra Medical, Inc. Based on our impairment analysis, we revised our expectations of the required effort, time and cost involved in completing the in-process projects and bringing the related products to market. As a result of these changes, we recorded an impairment charge of $129 million to write-down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value during the second quarter of 2012. 2011 ChargesDuring the third quarter of 2011, we recorded a $9 million intangible asset impairment charge attributable to lower projected cash flows associated with certain technologies. During the second quarter of 2011, we recorded a $12 million intangible asset impairment charge associated with changes in the timing and amount of the expected cash flows related to certain in-process research and development projects. Intangible asset impairment charges are non-cash charges that are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Contingent Consideration ExpenseCertain of our acquisitions involve contingent consideration arrangements. Payment of additional consideration is generally contingent on the acquired company reaching certain performance milestones, including attaining specified revenue levels, achieving product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payments we expect to make as of the acquisition date. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones.We recorded a net expense related to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities of $4 million in 2013, a net benefit of $6 million in 2012 and a net expense of $7 million in 2011. Contingent consideration expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating performance. See Note B – Acquisitions to our 2013 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our contingent consideration associated with our acquisitions. 50Restructuring-related Charges2014 Restructuring PlanAs of December 31, 2013, we have recorded costs of $30 million under the 2014 Restructuring Plan, of which $29 million has been recorded as restructuring charges and the remaining portion has been recorded through other lines within our consolidated statement of operations. Refer to Business and Market Overview and Note H – Restructuring-related Activities to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on our restructuring initiatives.2011 Restructuring PlanAs of December 31, 2013, we have recorded costs of $284 million since the inception of the 2011 Restructuring plan (as expanded), and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. Refer to Business and Market Overview and Note H – Restructuring-related Activities to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on our restructuring initiatives.2010 Restructuring PlanOn February 6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to focus our business, drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value. Key activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan included the restructuring of certain of our businesses and corporate functions; the re-alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets; and the re-prioritization and diversification of our product portfolio. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and were complete by the end of 2012, and resulted in gross reductions in pre-tax operating expenses of approximately $250 million. A portion of these savings were reinvested into customer-facing positions and other commercial resources and infrastructure.The execution of the 2010 Restructuring plan resulted in total pre-tax charges of $160 million, and required cash outlays of $145 million. We have recorded a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations.Plant Network Optimization ProgramIn January 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a plant network optimization initiative (the Plant Network Optimization program), intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The Plant Network Optimization program was intended to improve our overall gross profit margins. The Plant Network Optimization program has resulted in annualized run-rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65 million exiting 2012. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and were substantially completed during 2012.The execution of the Plant Network Optimization program resulted in total pre-tax charges of $126 million and required cash outlays of $103 million. We have recorded a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through cost of products sold within our consolidated statements of operations.In aggregate, we recorded restructuring charges pursuant to our restructuring plans of $101 million during 2013, $136 million during 2012, and $89 million during 2011. In addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of our accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $23 million during 2013, $24 million during 2012, and $40 million during 2011. Restructuring and restructuring-related costs are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.We made cash payments of $141 million in 2013, $149 million in 2012, and $114 million in 2011 associated with our restructuring initiatives.See Note H - Restructuring Related Activities to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details related to our restructuring plans. 51Litigation-related Charges and CreditsDuring 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recorded net litigation-related charges in the amount of $221 million, $192 million and $48 million, respectively. These charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants. See Note K - Commitments and Contingencies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional discussion of our litigation-related matters.Gain on DivestitureIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.5 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion during 2011, including an upfront payment of $1.426 billion, and $24 million which was placed into escrow and released throughout 2011 upon the completion of local closings in certain foreign jurisdictions. During 2012, we received an additional $10 million of consideration, which we recorded as a gain in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations. We received $30 million in 2013 and received the remaining $10 million of consideration in January 2014. Due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the Neurovascular business, the divestiture does not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $778 million during 2011 associated with the transaction, a gain of $15 million during 2012 and a gain of $38 million during 2013. These divestiture-related gains are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Interest ExpenseOur interest expense increased to $324 million in 2013, as compared to $261 million in 2012. The increase was primarily due to $70 million of debt extinguishment charges, representing premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of accelerated amortization of interest rate hedge gains related to early extinguishment of $1.450 billion of debt during the third quarter of 2013. Debt extinguishment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Including the debt extinguishment charges, our average borrowing rate was 6.9 percent in 2013 and 5.5 percent in 2012. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note F – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2013 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations.Our interest expense decreased to $261 million in 2012, as compared to $281 million in 2011. The decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels, due to repayment of $1.250 billion of debt during 2011, and the refinancing of our credit facility in April 2012 at lower average costs. Our average borrowing rate was 5.5 percent in 2012 and 5.4 percent in 2011.Other, netOur other, net reflected expense of $19 million in 2013, income of $22 million in 2012, and income of $19 million in 2011. The following are the components of other, net: Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201320122011Interest income $6$5$7Foreign currency losses (11)(18)(12)Net gains (losses) on investments (9)3727Other expense, net (5)(2)(3) $(19)$22$19During 2013, we recognized losses on investments of $9 million due to $7 million in investment impairments and $2 million for equity method adjustments on investments. During 2012, we recognized gains of $39 million associated with 2012 acquisitions in which we held prior equity interests, which were partially offset by net losses of $2 million related to our investment portfolio. During 2011, we recognized gains of $38 million associated with 2011 acquisitions in which we held prior equity interests, which were partially offset by net losses of $11 million on our investment portfolio. The acquisition-related gains from previously held investments are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. 52Tax RateThe following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Year EndedDecember 31, 201320122011Reported tax rate 46.0 %(1.0)%31.3 %Impact of certain receipts/charges* (35.4)%12.7 %(12.0)% 10.6 %11.7 %19.3 %*These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.The change in our reported tax rate for 2013, as compared to 2012 and 2011, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. In 2013, these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges, litigation- and restructuring-related charges, and debt extinguishment charges. Our reported tax rate for 2013 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied. In 2012, these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits, and litigation- and restructuring-related charges. Our reported tax rate for 2012 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from an unfavorable court ruling. Excluding the impact of these receipts and charges in 2013 and 2012, the change in our reported tax rate for 2013, as compared to 2012, is primarily the result of shifts in the geographic mix of our business. In 2011, these receipts and charges included a gain on our divestiture of the Neurovascular business, a non-deductible goodwill impairment charge, other intangible asset impairment charges and restructuring-, litigation- and acquisition-related charges and credits. Our reported tax rate was also affected by discrete tax items, related primarily to a release of valuation allowances resulting from a change in our expected ability to realize certain deferred tax assets, changes in various state tax laws, the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from closing agreements with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions, and the finalization of our 2010 U.S. Federal tax return.We have received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and Boston Scientific Corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years. Subsequent to issuing these Notices, the IRS conceded a portion of its original assessment. The total incremental tax liability now asserted by the IRS for the applicable periods is $1.162 billion plus interest. The primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. In addition, the IRS has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our Transaction Agreement with Abbott Laboratories pertaining to the sale of Guidant's vascular intervention business to Abbott in April 2006. We do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the IRS or its resulting assessment and we believe that the IRS has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated third-party agreement with Abbott. In addition, we believe that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations.We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed, or will timely file, petitions with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the Notices of Deficiency for the tax years in challenge. No payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. The IRS is currently examining the 2008 through 2010 tax years of Boston Scientific. During the first quarter of 2014 we were notified by the IRS of their intent to propose significant adjustments to our tax returns for these tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that are currently being contested in U.S. Tax Court for our tax years prior to 2008. As with the prior years, we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the IRS and we expect to contest any adjustments received through applicable IRS and judicial procedures, as appropriate. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. However, final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 53Liquidity and Capital ResourcesAs of December 31, 2013, we had $217 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $38 million invested in money market and government funds and $179 million in interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We also have full access to our $2.000 billion revolving credit facility and $300 million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables, both described below.The following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011: Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201320122011Cash provided by operating activities $1,082$1,260$1,008Cash provided by (used for) investing activities (475)(579)776Cash used for financing activities (596)(744)(1,728)Operating ActivitiesDuring 2013, we generated $1.082 billion from operating activities, as compared to $1.260 billion in 2012, a decrease of $178 million. This reduction was primarily due to the impact of increased levels of accounts receivable of approximately $100 million, payments related to debt extinguishment of approximately $70 million and net payments associated with litigation of approximately $50 million; partially offset by a final cash receipt associated with our Promus® supply agreement with Abbott.During 2012, we generated $1.260 billion from operating activities, as compared to $1.008 billion in 2011, an increase of $252 million. This increase was driven primarily by accounts receivable and inventory reductions, which generated $103 million; the impact of litigation-related payments of approximately $300 million to the U.S. Department of Justice in 2011; and lower tax-related net cash outflows of approximately $40 million during 2012. Partially offsetting these items was the impact of lower operating profit in 2012 and a $35 million increase in restructuring-related payments as compared to 2011. Our cash provided by operating activities in 2011 also included proceeds of approximately $80 million related to the termination of our outstanding interest rate derivative contracts and the receipt of a $75 million manufacturing cost true-up payment from Abbott in accordance with our supply agreement.Investing ActivitiesDuring 2013, cash used for investing activities was $475 million. Our investing activities included capital expenditures of $245 million and a $274 million payment for the acquisition of C.R. Bard's electrophysiology business. These expenditures were partially offset by $53 million of proceeds received from the sale of our Natick, Massachusetts headquarters in March 2013. We are currently in the process of consolidating our Natick, Massachusetts headquarters into our Marlborough, Massachusetts location, where we are establishing a new global headquarters campus. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately $250 million during 2014.During 2012, cash used for investing activities was $579 million. Our investing activities included capital expenditures of $226 million and payments for the acquisitions of Cameron Health Inc., Bridgepoint Medical Inc., Rhythmia Medical Inc., and Vessix Vascular Inc., totaling $367 million. During 2011, cash provided by investing activities was comprised primarily of proceeds from the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker. We received $1.440 billion of net cash proceeds during 2011 related to the sale of this business. This cash inflow was partially offset by payments of $370 million for acquisitions consummated during 2011; and capital expenditures of $304 million.Financing ActivitiesOur cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and repurchases of common stock pursuant to our authorized repurchase programs, discussed in Note L - Stockholders' Equity to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, our financing activities included $160 million of contingent payments primarily associated with our acquisition of Sadra and clinical milestones achieved by the Vessix™ Renal Denervation System. 54DebtWe had total debt of $4.240 billion as of December 31, 2013 and $4.256 billion as of December 31, 2012. During the third quarter of 2013, we refinanced our public debt obligations maturing in June 2014 and January 2015 (see Senior Notes below). The debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2013 is as follows: (in millions)2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 Thereafter TotalSenior notes$— $400 $600 $250 $600 $1,950 $3,800Term Loan— — 80 80 240 — 400 $— $400 $680 $330 $840 $1,950 $4,200Note:The table above does not include unamortized discounts associated with our senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes.In July 2011, Fitch Ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating to BBB-, an investment-grade rating; and in February 2012, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded our corporate credit rating to Baa3, an investment-grade rating. In addition, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services has maintained an investment-grade corporate credit rating for us since 2009. We believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy.Revolving Credit FacilityWe maintain a $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, maturing in April 2017, with a global syndicate of commercial banks. Eurodollar and multicurrency loans under this revolving credit facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin of between 0.875 percent and 1.475 percent, based on our corporate credit ratings and consolidated leverage ratio (1.275 percent, as of December 31, 2013). In addition, we are required to pay a facility fee based on our credit ratings, consolidated leverage ratio, and the total amount of revolving credit commitments, regardless of usage, under the agreement (0.225 percent, as of December 31, 2013). There were no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2013 or December 31, 2012. Our revolving credit facility agreement in place as of December 31, 2013 requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, as follows: CovenantRequirement Actual as of December 31, 2013Maximum leverage ratio (1)3.5 times 2.5 timesMinimum interest coverage ratio (2)3.0 times 5.2 times(1)Ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit agreement, for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters. (2)Ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the credit agreement, to interest expense for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters.The credit agreement provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, through the credit agreement maturity, of any non-cash charges and up to $500 million in restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses related to our current or future restructuring plans. As of December 31, 2013, we had $234 million of the restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any cash litigation payments (net of any cash litigation receipts), as defined by the agreement, are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA and any new debt issued to fund any tax deficiency payments is excluded from consolidated total debt, as defined in the agreement, provided that the sum of any excluded net cash litigation payments and any new debt issued to fund any tax deficiency payments shall not exceed $2.300 billion in the aggregate. As of December 31, 2013, we had approximately $2.185 billion of the combined legal and debt exclusion remaining. As of and through December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the required covenants.Any inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers. 55Term LoanIn August 2013, we entered into a new $400 million, unsecured term loan facility. Term loan borrowings under this facility bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin of between 1.0 percent and 1.75 percent (currently 1.5 percent), based on our corporate credit ratings and consolidated leverage ratio. The term loan borrowings are payable over a five-year period, with quarterly principal payments of $20 million commencing in the first quarter of 2016 and the remaining principal amount due at the final maturity date in August 2018, and are repayable at any time without premium or penalty. Our term loan facility requires that we comply with certain covenants, including financial covenants with respect to maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage; the maximum leverage ratio requirement is 3.5 times, our actual leverage ratio as of December 31, 2013 is 2.5 times and the minimum interest coverage ratio requirement is 3.0 times, our actual interest coverage ratio as of December 31, 2013 is 5.2 times. We had $400 million outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2013 and no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2012.Senior NotesWe had senior notes outstanding of $3.800 billion and $4.200 billion as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012, respectively. In August 2013, we issued $600 million of 2.650% senior notes due in 2018, and $450 million of 4.125% senior notes due in 2023. In September 2013, we used the proceeds, together with borrowings under our new $400 million term loan facility, to prepay $600 million of senior notes maturing in June 2014 and $850 million maturing in January 2015. We recorded a one-time charge of $70 million ($44 million after-tax) for premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of accelerated amortization of interest rate hedge gains related to the early debt extinguishment. Our senior notes are publicly registered securities, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to borrowings under our credit and security facility and liabilities of our subsidiaries (see Other Arrangements below).Other ArrangementsWe also maintain a credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. In June 2013, we extended the maturity of this facility through June 2015, subject to further extension, reduced the size of the facility from $350 million to $300 million and added a maximum leverage covenant consistent with our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. The maximum leverage ratio requirement is 3.5 times and our actual leverage ratio as of December 31, 2013 is 2.5 times. We had no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2013 and December 31, 2012.We have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries that we account for as sales under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. These agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties, without recourse, of up to approximately $312 million as of December 31, 2013. We have no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities and, once sold, the accounts receivable are no longer available to satisfy creditors in the event of bankruptcy. We de-recognized $146 million of receivables as of December 31, 2013 at an average interest rate of 3.3 percent, and $191 million as of December 31, 2012 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent. Within Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece the number of days our receivables are outstanding has increased above historical levels. We believe we have adequate allowances for doubtful accounts related to our Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece accounts receivable; however, we continue to monitor the European economic environment for collectibility issues related to our outstanding receivables. In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with a commercial Japanese bank that provide for borrowings, promissory notes discounting and receivables factoring of up to 21.0 billion Japanese yen (approximately $200 million as of December 31, 2013). We de-recognized $147 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2013 at an average interest rate of 1.8 percent and $182 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2012 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent. De-recognized accounts and notes receivable are excluded from trade accounts receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.As of December 31, 2013, we had outstanding letters of credit of $78 million, as compared to $94 million as of December 31, 2012, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers' compensation insurance arrangements. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees; accordingly, we have not recognized a related liability for our outstanding letters of credit in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 or 2012. We believe we will generate sufficient cash from operations to fund these payments and intend to fund these payments without drawing on the letters of credit. 56EquityDuring 2013 we received $74 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $21 million in both 2012 and 2011. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.In July 2011, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion in shares of our common stock and re-approved approximately 37 million shares remaining under a previous share repurchase program. On January 25, 2013, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $1.0 billion in shares of our common stock. Throughout 2013, we repurchased approximately 51 million shares of our common stock for $500 million. During 2012, we repurchased approximately 105 million shares of our common stock for $600 million. During 2011, we repurchased approximately 82 million shares of our common stock for $492 million. Repurchased shares are available for reissuance under our equity incentive plans and for general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. As of December 31, 2013, we had completed our share repurchase program authorized in 2011 and previous share repurchase programs. We had remaining approximately $660 million authorized under our 2013 share repurchase program as of December 31, 2013. There were approximately 238 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2013 and 187 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2012.Stock-based compensation expense related to our stock equity compensation and ownership plans was $105 million in 2013, $108 million in 2012, and $128 million in 2011. Stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors: the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period; forfeiture levels related to unvested awards; and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2013.

Purchase obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.069 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note J – Income Taxes to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits.With certain of our acquisitions, we acquired in-process research and development projects that require future funding to complete the projects. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the in-process research and development projects acquired in 2011-2013 is between $200 million and $250 million and we expect material net cash inflows from the projects in development to commence in 2014 through 2018, following the respective launches of these technologies in the U.S., Europe and Japan regions. Certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B – Acquisitions to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2013. 57Legal MattersThe medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. Over the years, there has been litigation initiated against us by others, including our competitors, claiming that our current or former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. Intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases, but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. Although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies. During recent years, we successfully negotiated closure of several long-standing legal matters and have received favorable legal rulings in several other matters; however, there continues to be outstanding intellectual property litigation. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.In the normal course of business, product liability, securities and commercial claims are asserted against us. Similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time. We maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims, and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation, and other legal proceedings in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.In addition, like other companies in the medical device industry, we are subject to extensive regulation by national, state and local government agencies in the United States and other countries in which we operate. From time to time we are the subject of qui tam actions and governmental investigations often involving regulatory, marketing and other business practices. These qui tam actions and governmental investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies and have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and/or liquidity.Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $607 million as of December 31, 2013 and $491 million as of December 31, 2012, and includes certain estimated costs of settlement, damages and defense. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants.See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We describe these accounting policies in Note A–Significant Accounting Policies to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring management’s judgment that we consider critical: 58Revenue RecognitionWe allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.Many of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE® Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period. We do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations; therefore, we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available; otherwise, we use our best estimate of selling price. We allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.Inventory ProvisionsWe base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration LiabilitiesWe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including in-process research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations, amortization expense, and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods.We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable, as discussed in Note A - Significant Accounting Policies, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. We generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset (asset group). The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value. 59Valuation of CRM-related Amortizable Intangible AssetsCertain of our amortizable intangible assets that relate to our CRM business ($4.374 billion globally as of December 31, 2013) are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods. Key assumptions we have made in determining the recoverability of these assets include how we grouped our assets for purposes of measuring cash flows, the estimated life of those cash flows and our expectations for the amount of cash flows generated by these assets over their remaining useful life. For purposes of testing the CRM-related amortizable intangible assets, we grouped the intangible assets with the other assets and liabilities of the global CRM reporting unit, as a result of having identified the CRM reporting unit as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows because our CRM core technology, which is the primary asset within the CRM asset group, is utilized by all CRM revenue-generating products. As a result, we include cash flows generated by our CRM products in our recoverability analysis through the core technology useful life, which is estimated to end in 2031. We determined the useful life of the core technology based on our expectation of the period during which the technology is expected to contribute to the cash flows of our business. Our core technology represents know-how, patented and unpatented technology, testing methodologies and hardware that is integral to our current and future CRM product generations. This core technology includes battery and capacitor technology, lead technology, software algorithms and interfacing for shocking and pacing used in each therapy franchise. The recoverability of our CRM-related amortizable intangible assets is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global CRM business performance. The amount of future cash flows within our recoverability analysis include our future projections of revenue, expenses and capital expenditures, which are based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. These future cash flow assumptions consider the significant investments we have made to renew the CRM reporting unit's product portfolio within its existing core franchises and to develop what we believe to be unique innovative solutions that utilize our core technology; the increased impact to the CRM reporting unit from emerging markets; and demographic trends toward an aging population. Further, while our CRM revenue has declined over the last three years as a result of factors specific to our CRM business and contraction in the overall CRM market, we believe our CRM revenue will return to low growth over the remaining useful life of our CRM amortizing intangible assets. Events specific to our CRM business included the 2010 product ship hold actions and resulting market share losses, and lower replacement volumes due to historical product recalls. We believe that the contraction in the CRM market was primarily due to lower procedural volumes principally due to a focus on appropriate device usage and increased pressure on selling prices; however, we believe that there has been a recent trend toward stabilization in procedural volumes across the market.We continue to perform thorough reviews of the CRM market and our recent business results within the market, and consider the impacts on future expectations of performance to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life.Goodwill ValuationEffective as of January 1, 2013, we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units. Our reorganization changed our reporting structure and changed the composition of our reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes. Following the reorganization, based on information regularly reviewed by our chief operating decision maker, we have three new global reportable segments consisting of: Cardiovascular, Rhythm Management, and MedSurg. We determined our new global reporting units by identifying our operating segments and assessing whether any components of these segments constituted a business for which discrete financial information is available and whether segment management regularly reviews the operating results of any components. Through this process, we identified the following new global reporting units as of January 1, 2013: Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Women's Health, and Neuromodulation.To determine the amount of goodwill within our new global reporting units, on a relative fair value basis we reallocated $1.764 billion of goodwill previously allocated to our former Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), Asia Pacific, Japan, and Americas international reporting units to our new global reporting units. In addition, we reallocated the goodwill previously allocated to the former U.S. divisional reporting units to each respective new global reporting unit, with the exception of the goodwill allocated to the former U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit. The $2.380 billion of goodwill allocated to the former U.S. Cardiovascular reporting unit was reallocated between the new global Interventional Cardiology and global Peripheral Interventions reporting units on a relative fair value basis. 60We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the assessment, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. For our 2013 annual impairment assessment, we identified seven reporting units, including Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Women's Health and Neuromodulation. For our 2012 and 2011 impairment assessments, we identified six reporting units within the U.S., including our CRM, Neuromodulation, Endoscopy, Urology and Women's Health, Electrophysiology, and Cardiovascular (consisting of Interventional Cardiology and Peripheral Interventions) franchises. In addition, we identified four international reporting units, including EMEA, Japan, Asia Pacific and the Americas. When allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition. In addition, for purposes of performing our goodwill impairment tests, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets, which relate to a reporting unit’s operations, and would be considered in determining its fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit.During 2013, 2012, and 2011, we used only the income approach, specifically the DCF method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted WACC as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units’ future expected cash flows.If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative, we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. If we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists, we then perform the second step of the goodwill test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value. If we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated, we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate. We would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods, once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test.Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates. 61We have identified our global Neuromodulation reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. Our global Neuromodulation reporting unit holds $1.356 billion of allocated goodwill. The level of excess fair value over carrying value for this reporting unit identified during our annual goodwill impairment test was approximately 16 percent. Future changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units, including global CRM. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. The key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability. Terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges. For example, keeping all other variables constant, an increase in the WACC applied of 80 basis points or a 200 basis point decrease in the terminal value growth rate would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for the global Neuromodulation reporting unit. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management's best estimates, which we believe to be reasonable, but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances. Future events that could have a negative impact on the levels of excess fair value over carrying value of our reporting units and/or amortizable intangible assets include, but are not limited to:•decreases in estimated market sizes or market growth rates due to greater-than-expected declines in procedural volumes, pricing pressures, reductions in reimbursement levels, product actions, and/or competitive or disruptive technology developments;•declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition, an inability to develop or launch new and next-generation products and technology features in line with our commercialization strategies, and market and/or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls;•decreases in our forecasted profitability due to an inability to successfully implement and achieve timely and sustainable cost improvement measures consistent with our expectations, increases in our market-participant tax rate, and/or changes in tax laws;•negative developments in intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products or increase our costs to sell certain products;•the level of success of on-going and future research and development efforts, including those related to recent acquisitions, and increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products;•the level of success in managing the growth of acquired companies, achieving sustained profitability consistent with our expectations, establishing government and third-party payer reimbursement, supplying the market, and increases in the costs and time necessary to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully;•changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses; and•increases in our market-participant risk-adjusted WACC. Negative changes in one or more of these factors, among others, could result in additional impairment charges.Income TaxesWe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of these matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results. 62We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years.New Accounting PronouncementsStandards ImplementedASC Update No. 2013-02In February 2013, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2013-02, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reporting of Amounts Reclassified out of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income. Update No. 2013-02 requires that entities provide information about amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income by component. The amendment also requires entities to present significant amounts by the respective line items of net income, either on the face of the income statement or in the notes to the financial statements for amounts required to be reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income in their entirety in the same reporting period. For other amounts that are not required to be reclassified to net income in their entirety, a cross-reference is required to other disclosures that provide additional details about those amounts. We adopted Update No. 2013-02 beginning in our first quarter ended March 31, 2013. Update No. 2013-02 is related to presentation only and its adoption did not impact our results of operations or financial position. See our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss) and Note P - Changes in Other Comprehensive Income to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the required disclosures under Update No. 2013-02.ASC Update No. 2013-01In January 2013, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2013-01, Balance Sheet (Topic 210): Clarifying the Scope of Disclosures about Offsetting Assets and Liabilities. Update No. 2013-01 clarifies the FASB's intent about requiring enhanced disclosures about certain financial instruments and derivative instruments that are offset in the statement of financial position or that are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements. We adopted Update No. 2013-01 beginning in our first quarter ended March 31, 2013. See Note E - Fair Value Measurements to our 2013 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the required disclosures under Update No. 2013-01.Standards to be ImplementedASC Update No. 2013-11In July 2013, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2013-11, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Presentation of an Unrecognized Tax Benefit When a Net Operating Loss Carryforward, a Similar Tax Loss, or a Tax Credit Carryforward Exists. Update No. 2013-11 requires that entities present an unrecognized tax benefit, or portion of an unrecognized tax benefit, as a reduction to a deferred tax asset in the financial statements for a net operating loss carryforward, a similar tax loss, or a tax credit carryforward, with certain exceptions. We are required to adopt Update No. 2013-11 for our first quarter ending March 31, 2014. Update No. 2013-11 is related to presentation only and its adoption will not impact our results of operations or financial position.Additional InformationUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures by Boston ScientificTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income per share. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure that excludes sales from divested businesses is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules. 63Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments’ measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.We believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts, such as sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share•Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges - This amount represents (a) a non-cash write-down of our goodwill balance attributable to our global Cardiac Rhythm Management reporting unit in the first quarter of 2013; (b) non-cash write-downs of certain intangible asset balances in the second quarter of 2013; (c) a non-cash write-down of our goodwill balance attributable to our former U.S. Cardiac Rhythm Management reporting unit in the third quarter of 2012; (d) a non-cash write-down of our goodwill balance attributable to our former EMEA reporting unit in the second quarter of 2012; and (e) non-cash write-downs of certain intangible asset balances in the second and third quarters of 2012. We remove the impact of non-cash impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, these charges are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity.•Acquisition- and divestiture related net charges (credits) - These adjustments consist of (a) contingent consideration fair value adjustments; (b) due diligence, other fees and exit costs; and (c) separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011. The contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments. Due diligence, other fees and exit costs include legal, tax, severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions and divestitures that can be highly variable and not representative of on-going operations. Separation costs and gains on the sale of a business unit primarily represent those associated with the Neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of on-going operations. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Restructuring and restructuring-related charges - These adjustments represent primarily severance and other direct costs associated with our 2014 Restructuring program and 2011 Restructuring program. These costs are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these costs for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Litigation-related charges - These adjustments include certain significant product liability and other litigation-related charges and credits. These amounts are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. 64•Discrete tax items - These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions, which were initially established in prior periods as a result of intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- or litigation-related charges or credits. These adjustments do not reflect expected on-going operating results. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Debt extinguishment charge - This item represents premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.450 billion of debt during the third quarter of 2013. These adjustments are not expected to recur and do not reflect expected on-going operating results. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Amortization expense - Amortization expense is a non-cash expense and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in our credit facility agreement. Management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, amortization expense is excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation. Accordingly, management has excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity.Revenue Growth Rates Excluding the Impact of Sales from Divested Businesses and/or Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates•Sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates - Sales from divested businesses are primarily associated with the Neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of on-going operations. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict. Accordingly, management excludes the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts, such as the sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans by Executive OfficersPeriodically, certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act and our own Stock Trading Policy. A Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amount, prices and dates (or formulas for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including shares issued upon exercise of stock options or vesting of deferred stock units. These plans are entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non-public information about the Company. On November 26, 2013, Michael P. Phalen, our Executive Vice President and President, MedSurg, entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan. Mr. Phalen’s plan covers the sale of shares of our stock to be acquired upon (A) exercise of 162,000 stock options and (B) vesting of deferred stock units representing 29,582 shares (the amount to be sold will be net of shares withheld to satisfy applicable tax withholding obligations upon vesting). Transactions under Mr. Phalen’s plan are based upon pre-established dates and stock price thresholds. Mr. Phalen’s plan will terminate on the earlier of (among other things) December 31, 2014 and the date all shares subject to the plan have been sold. Any transaction under Mr. Phalen’s plan will be disclosed publicly through appropriate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 65On November 26, 2013, David A. Pierce, our Senior Vice President and President, Endoscopy, entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan. Mr. Pierce’s plan covers the sale of shares of our stock to be acquired upon vesting of deferred stock units representing 23,422 shares (the amount to be sold will be net of shares withheld to satisfy applicable tax withholding obligations upon vesting). Transactions under Mr. Pierce’s plan are based upon pre-established dates and stock price thresholds. Mr. Pierce’s plan will terminate on the earlier of (among other things) December 31, 2014 and the date all shares subject to the plan have been sold. Any transaction under Mr. Pierce’s plan will be disclosed publicly through appropriate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 66Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingAs the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (1992 framework). Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2013, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on the COSO criteria.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 26, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLPBoston, MassachusettsFebruary 26, 2014 68ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $4.516 billion as of December 31, 2013 and $4.411 billion as of December 31, 2012. We recorded $264 million of other assets and $55 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2013, as compared to $121 million of other assets and $57 million of other liabilities as of December 31, 2012. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $257 million as of December 31, 2013 and $270 million as of December 31, 2012. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $314 million as of December 31, 2013 and by $319 million as of December 31, 2012. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operations.Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of $450 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 to convert fixed-rate debt associated with certain of our senior notes into floating-rate debt. We recorded $1 million of other assets and $8 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2013. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2012. A one-percentage point increase in interest rates would have decreased the derivative instruments’ fair value by $41 million as of December 31, 2013. A one-percentage point decrease in interest rates would have increased the derivative instruments’ fair value by $37 million as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2013, $3.393 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates, representing approximately 80 percent of our total debt.See Note E – Fair Value Measurements to our 2013 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding our derivative financial instruments. 69Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific CorporationWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Boston Scientific Corporation at December 31, 2013 and 2012, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2013, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Boston Scientific Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2013, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (1992 framework), as applicable and our report dated February 26, 2014 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLPBoston, MassachusettsFebruary 26, 2014 70",2023-12-30 19:42:26.539984

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for additional information.InnovationOur approach to innovation combines internally-developed products and technologies with those we may obtain externally through strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our research and development efforts are focused largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. In addition, we have undertaken strategic acquisitions to help enable us to continue to be a leader in the medical device industry. We expect to continue to invest in our core franchises, and also investigate opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, strategic growth adjacencies. During the last several years, we have closed multiple acquisitions to strengthen our core franchises and expand into high growth adjacencies. There can be no assurance that technologies developed internally or acquired through acquisitions and alliances will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance, and any delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our ability to drive future growth.Research and DevelopmentOur investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth. We expended $817 million on research and development in 2014, $861 million in 2013, and $886 million in 2012. Our investment in research and development reflects the following:•regulatory compliance, clinical science, and internal research and development programs, as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances; and•engineering efforts that incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and next-generation products.We have directed our development efforts toward regulatory compliance and innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets. We are transforming the way we conduct research and development and are scrutinizing our cost structure, which we believe will enable increased development activity and faster concept to market timelines. Our approach to new product design and development is through focused, cross-functional teams. We believe that our formal process for technology and product development aids in our ability to offer and manufacture innovative products in a consistent and timely manner. Involvement of the research and development, clinical, quality, regulatory, manufacturing and marketing teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle. We believe this collaboration allows these teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies, and focus on bringing them to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. In addition to internal development, we work with hundreds of leading research institutions, universities and clinicians around the world to develop, evaluate and clinically test our products. We believe our future success will depend upon the strength of these development efforts. 8Marketing and SalesDuring 2014, we marketed our products to approximately 25,000 hospitals, clinics, outpatient facilities and medical offices in the U.S. and across over 110 countries worldwide. The majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations. We also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets, which accounts for our remaining sales. We expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third parties in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence. No single institution accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2014 or 2013; however, large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales. We have a dedicated corporate sales organization in the U.S. focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks. We consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers. Each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focused on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions. We believe that this focused disease state management enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with physicians. We believe that we have positive working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry, which enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and their patients. International OperationsInternational net sales accounted for approximately 47 percent of our net sales in 2014. Maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Through our international presence, we seek to increase net sales and market share, leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs, accelerate the time to bring new products to market, and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines. In addition, we are investing in infrastructure in emerging markets in order to introduce products and strengthen our sales capabilities in these countries.As of December 31, 2014, we had six international manufacturing facilities, including three in Ireland, two in Costa Rica and one in Puerto Rico. Approximately 57 percent of our products manufactured in 2014 were produced at these facilities. Additionally, we maintain international research and development capabilities in Ireland and China and are establishing capabilities in India. We operate physician training centers in France, Japan, and China, and we are currently developing physician training centers in India and South Africa.Manufacturing and Raw MaterialsWe are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization. We believe by sourcing global manufacturing by technology capabilities, we are able to leverage our existing resources and concentrate on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products. We continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability and service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs, and have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations, supplier controls, distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify cost-improvement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness.Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. In most cases, the manufacturing of each of our product families is concentrated in one location. We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter. However, significant interruptions in the manufacturing of our products for an extended duration may result in loss of market share, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We also have an on-going program to identify single-source components and to develop alternative back-up supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs. 9In certain cases we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific materials, components or products, largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers. A reduction or interruption in supply, an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required, or a significant increase in the price of raw materials, components or products could adversely affect our operations and financial condition, particularly materials or components related to our CRM products and drug-eluting stent systems. In addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service. We believe we have capabilities sufficient to sterilize our products; however, to the extent we or our third-party sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity, availability of materials for sterilization, regulatory or other constraints, we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizers, sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our operations.Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has promulgated rules applicable to public companies that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products. The rules require us to undertake measures to understand the origin and, as need be, source of conflict minerals within our supply chain and to disclose, among other things, those measures and whether or not any such conflict minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. These requirements could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be sourced from that region. Quality Assurance We are committed to providing high quality products to our customers. Our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product, component specification process and the manufacturing, sale and servicing of the product. Our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life. These systems are designed to enable us to satisfy the various international quality system regulations, including those of the FDA with respect to products sold in the U.S. All of our manufacturing facilities, and our U.S. and European distribution centers, are certified under the ISO13485 quality system standard, established by the International Standards Organization, for medical devices, which requires, among other items, an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. This certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a company’s quality system by an independent outside auditor. Maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic re-examination.Environmental Regulation and ManagementWe are subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad. Our operations, like those of other medical device companies, involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We do not believe that compliance with environmental laws will have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, given the scope and nature of these laws, there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not have a material impact on our results of operations. We assess potential environmental contingent liabilities on a regular basis. At present, we are not aware of any such liabilities that would have a material impact on our business.We believe that sound environmental, health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers, shareholders and employees. We are focused on continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution, the depletion of natural resources, and our overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we are working to optimize energy and resource usage, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste. We are certified to the FTSE4Good Corporate Social Responsibility Index, managed by The Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility. This certification recognizes our dedication to those standards, and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policies.We have completed an initiative and obtained ISO 14001:2004 certification at our major manufacturing plants and Tier 1 distribution centers around the world. In addition, in 2014, our Corporate Headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts was certified to the ISO14001:2004 standard. ISO 14001:2004 is a globally recognized standard for Environmental Management Systems, established by the International Standards Organization, which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business. Using this environmental management system and the specific attributes of our certified locations in the U.S., Ireland, Costa Rica and the Netherlands, we continue to improve our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprint. 10CompetitionWe encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products from various companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories; Medtronic, Inc.; St. Jude Medical, Inc.; and Cook Medical; as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, such as pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our products.We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers; while also continuing to safely and effectively perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a less-invasive manner, as well as to provide ease of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current environment of managed care, economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and market sizes. We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to: offer products and solutions that offer differentiated clinical and economic outcomes; create or acquire innovative, scientifically advanced technologies; apply our technology and solutions cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets; develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions; attract and retain skilled personnel; obtain patent or other protection for our products; obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals; continually enhance our quality systems; manufacture and successfully market our products and solutions either directly or through outside parties; and supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demand.Medical Device Regulatory ApprovalsThe medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, based on the risk level of the device. In the U.S., authorization to commercially distribute a new device generally can be met in one of three ways. The first process requires that a premarket notification (510(k)) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device, the “predicate” device. Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.The second process requires the submission of a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices, and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose, and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). For novel technologies, the FDA will generally seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process.The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) be made to the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). An HUD is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects, or is manifested in, fewer than 4,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE is similar in both form and content to a PMA application, but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA. The HUD provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populations. 11In the European Union, we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives (including the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive) and obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity. It is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable European Medical Devices Directives. We are also required to comply with the regulations of each other country where we commercialize products, such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) and China Food and Drug Administration before we can launch new products in Japan and China, respectively. The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record keeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country, or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations.International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent, and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, on existing regulations. Certain regulators are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect that the global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain or maintain future approvals for our products, or could increase the cost and time to obtain or maintain such approvals in the future.Government AffairsWe maintain a global Government Affairs presence, headquartered in Washington D.C., to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies impacting us, both on a domestic and an international front. The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress and committee staff, the White House and Administration offices, state legislatures and regulatory agencies, and governments overseas on issues affecting our business. Our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal, state and global decision-makers, while also advancing our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions, key priorities and the value of our technologies. The Government Affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in general.Healthcare PoliciesPolitical, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation); coverage and payment policies; comparative effectiveness of therapies; technology assessments; and health care delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payors, and other stakeholders may be significant and may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption. In addition, the impact to our business of the United States’ Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (ACA) provisions related to coverage expansion, payment reforms, and delivery system changes remains uncertain. 12In addition, the federal government, as part of the ACA, and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between medical device, biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals (HCPs). As a result, we are required by law to report many types of payments made and items of value provided to HCPs licensed by certain states. In addition, certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws. Failure to adhere to our policies, comply with required laws or implement adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations. We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as governments and purchasers implement payment reforms such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations (ACOs). We also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other groups that seek to aggregate purchasing power continue to take shape globally. Similarly, governments are increasing the use of tenders, placing pressure on medical device pricing. In addition, patients and clinicians are becoming more informed on the risks and benefits of alternative treatments as comparative effectiveness research findings are beginning to be disseminated. Therefore, we believe that compelling clinical and economic data will become increasingly important to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchases.See Healthcare Policies within Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for additional information.Third-Party Coverage and ReimbursementOur products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payors, including governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S.), private insurance plans and managed care programs, for the healthcare services provided to their patients.Third-party payors and governments may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Reimbursement decisions by payors for these services are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services' assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value. These reimbursement methodologies and decisions confer different, and sometimes conflicting, levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients, and these methodologies and decisions are subject to frequent refinements. Third-party payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates, often downwards, and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. There can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by third-party payors, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third-party payors' coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.Proprietary Rights and Patent LitigationWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2014, we held more than 16,000 patents, and had approximately 6,200 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. There can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license, except for those relating to our drug-eluting coronary stent systems, is material in relation to our business as a whole.We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge. 13There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Adverse determinations in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties, and, if licenses are not available, prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Patent litigation can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the future or that the outcome of litigation will be favorable to us. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties. We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims, and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. See Item 3 and Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of intellectual property and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved. In management’s opinion, we are not currently involved in any legal proceeding other than those specifically identified in Note K, which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operations and/or cash flows.Risk ManagementWe have an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program in which we provide coordinated oversight, control and continuous improvement of processes and tools used to identify and manage business risk. On an annual basis, we reassess our risks based on the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) ERM framework in the areas of strategic risk, financial risk, external risk, operational risk and compliance risk with the goal of achieving our business strategies and objectives. This assessment, which engages key individuals from our Board of Directors and management, provides increased visibility and alignment of the risks we face, and seeks to improve the effectiveness of our overall risk management. Current Economic ClimateOur results of operations could be substantially affected by global economic factors and local operating and economic conditions. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products, particularly capital equipment, or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis, if at all. We cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions, including the increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the U.S. and abroad may negatively impact our average selling prices, our net sales and profit margins, procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third-party payors.EmployeesAs of December 31, 2014, we had approximately 24,000 employees, including approximately 11,000 in operations; 7,000 in selling, marketing and distribution; 3,000 in clinical, regulatory and research and development; and 3,000 in administration. Of these employees, we employed approximately 12,000 outside the U.S., approximately 7,000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function. We believe that the continued success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and we are committed to developing our people and providing them with opportunities to contribute to our growth and success.Community OutreachWe are committed to transforming lives and making a positive impact on the communities in which we live and work. We bring this commitment to life by supporting global, national and local health and education initiatives, striving to improve patient advocacy, adhering to strong ethical standards that deliver on our commitments, and minimizing our impact on the environment. A prominent example of our ongoing commitment to patients is our Close the Gap program, which aims to eliminate treatment disparities in underserved patient populations to ensure all patients - regardless of age, gender, race, ethnicity or primary language - receive access to quality health care. 14To achieve this goal, Close the Gap increases awareness and access to care in communities at high risk for cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and pulmonary diseases, engages with healthcare providers about barriers to treatment in underserved patient populations and advocates for measures that help ensure all patients receive the care they need. By sponsoring programs and executing educational programs through community partnerships in the community, our Close the Gap program has helped these messages reach more than one million people to date.Through the Boston Scientific Foundation, established in 2001, we fund non-profit organizations in our local U.S. communities. Community grants focus on increasing access to quality healthcare and improving educational opportunities, particularly related to science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education.SeasonalityOur worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, customer purchases have historically been lower in the third quarter of the year, as compared to other quarters. This reflects, among other factors, lower demand during summer months in the northern hemisphere, particularly in European countries.Available InformationCopies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), are available free of charge on our website (www.bostonscientific.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the material with or furnish it to the U.S. SEC.

RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements set forth at the end of Item 1 of this Annual Report. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.We face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The medical device markets in which we primarily participate are highly competitive. We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do, including as a result of consolidation among our competitors in the healthcare industry. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories; Medtronic, Inc.; St. Jude Medical, Inc. and Cook Medical, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or which participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, including pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our products.Additionally, the medical device markets in which we primarily participate are characterized by extensive research and development, and rapid technological change. Developments by other companies of new or improved products, processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales. We are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards. If we fail to develop or acquire new products or enhance existing products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Declines in average selling prices for our products, particularly our drug-eluting coronary stent systems, may materially adversely affect our results of operations. We have experienced pricing pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity, increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates, economic pressures experienced by our customers, and the impact of managed care organizations and other third-party payors. Any declines in average selling prices of our products due to pricing pressures may have an adverse impact on our results of operations.We derive a significant portion of our net sales from the sale of drug-eluting coronary stent systems and CRM products. Declines in market size, average selling prices, procedural volumes, and our share of the markets in which we compete; increased competition; market perceptions of studies published by third parties; or product launch delays may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Net sales from drug-eluting coronary stent systems represented approximately 16 percent of our consolidated net sales during 2014. In 2014, the launch of our PREMIER drug-eluting stent in the U.S. and Japan contributed to an increase in our share of the U.S. and global drug-eluting stent markets. We estimate that the global market for drug-eluting stents grew slightly in 2014 due to increased procedure volumes partially offset by price declines. There can be no assurance that these and other factors will not further impact our share of the U.S. or worldwide drug-eluting stent markets, that we will regain or gain share of the U.S. or worldwide drug-eluting stent markets, or that the size of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market will reach previous levels or will not decline further, all of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition. In addition, a delay in the timing of the launch of next-generation products, the overall performance of, and continued physician confidence in, those products may result in a further decline in our market share and have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Net sales from our CRM group represented approximately 26 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2014. Our CRM net sales increased one percent in 2014 primarily driven by increases in our denovo ICD market share and our new line of defibrillators; partially offset by lower volumes of replacement procedures and implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator market share losses in certain regions. There can be no assurance that the size of the CRM market will increase above existing levels or that we will be able to continue to increase our CRM market share or increase our net sales in a timely manner, if at all. Decreases in market size or our share of the CRM market and decreases in net sales from our CRM products could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations. Further, variability in the timing of the launch of next-generation products may 19result in excess or expired inventory positions and future inventory charges, or may result in a loss of market share and adversely impact our results of operations.Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to increased demands for price concessions or limit or eliminate our ability to sell to certain of our significant market segments, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Because healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have catalyzed a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and will continue to become more intense. This in turn has resulted in greater pricing pressures, decreased average selling prices, and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for hospitals. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may increase competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.We are subject to a number of market, business, financial, legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations that could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. International net sales accounted for approximately 47 percent of our global net sales in 2014, with sales from emerging markets accounting for approximately ten percent. An important part of our growth strategy is to continue pursuing growth opportunities in net sales and market share outside of the U.S. by expanding global presence, including in in emerging markets. Our international operations are subject to a number of market, business and financial risks and uncertainties, including those related to political and economic instability; foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations; competitive products offerings; local changes in health care financing and payment systems and health care delivery systems; local product preferences and requirements, including preferences for local manufacturers; workforce instability; less; intellectual property protection in certain countries than exists in the United States; and, in certain foreign countries, longer accounts receivable cycles. Such risks and uncertainties may adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy in these markets and, as a result, our sales growth market share and operating profits from our international operations may be adversely affected. Our international operations are subject to established and developing legal and regulatory requirements for medical devices in each country in which our products are marketed and sold. Most foreign countries have medical device regulations. Further, most countries outside of the U.S. require product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis in order to continue to be marketed and sold there. In addition, several countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, on existing regulations, including requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data. These factors have caused or may cause us to experience more uncertainty, risk, expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions, which could affect our ability to obtain approvals for our products in those jurisdictions and adversely impact our net sales, market share and operating profits from our international operations.Further, international markets are increasingly being affected by economic pressure to contain healthcare costs, which can lead to lower reimbursement rates for either our products directly or procedures in which are our products are used. Governments and payers may also institute changes in health care delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of health care costs. In addition, certain international markets may also be affected by foreign government efforts to reference reimbursement rates in other countries. All of these types of changes may ultimately reduce selling prices of our products, which may adversely impact our net sales, market share and operating profits from our international operations.In addition, our international operations are subject to other established and developing U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and/or similar laws in other countries; and U.S. and foreign import and export controls and licensing requirements, trade protection and embargo measures and customs laws. Global businesses, including those in the medical device industry, are facing increasing scrutiny of, and heightened enforcement efforts with respect to, their international operations. Any alleged or actual failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may subject us to government scrutiny, civil and/or criminal proceedings, sanctions and other liabilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our international operations, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity. Any significant changes in the political and economic, financial, competitive, legal and regulatory or reimbursement conditions where we conduct, or plan to expand, our international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 20If we are unable to manage our debt levels, maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies, or experience a disruption in our cash flows it could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing, financial condition or results of operations.As part of our strategy to maximize stockholder value we use financial leverage to reduce our cost of capital. Our outstanding debt balance was at $4.262 billion as of December 31, 2014 and $4.240 billion as of December 31, 2013. In February 2012, Moody's Investors Service upgraded our corporate credit rating to Baa3, an investment-grade rating, and in July 2011, Fitch Ratings upgraded our corporate credit rating to BBB-, an investment-grade rating. In addition, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services has maintained an investment-grade corporate credit rating for us since 2009. We believe these ratings reflect the strength of our product portfolio and cash flows, the reduction of our debt, and our improved financial fundamentals. Our inability to maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies, however, could increase our cost of borrowing funds in the future. Delays in our product development and new product launches, disruption in our cash flow or our ability to continue to effectively manage our debt levels could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our credit and security facilities contains covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and place other limits on our business. If we are unable to satisfy these covenants, we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all, and we could be required to repay any borrowings on demand.We may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges related to one or more of our global reporting units, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. In the second quarter of 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test. We identified our global Neuromodulation and global Electrophysiology reporting units as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. As of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, our global Neuromodulation reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 55 percent and held $1.356 billion of allocated goodwill. As of the date of our annual goodwil impairment test, our global Electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 38 percent and held $292 million of allocated goodwill. During the fourth quarter of 2014, due to changes in our expectations of the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flow related to our Electrophysiology reporting unit, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test on this reporting unit. Based on this assessment, we concluded that the fair value of the Electrophysiology reporting unit exceeded its carrying value; however the level of excess fair value over the carrying value had declined to approximately 26 percent. Our global Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) reporting unit had a fair value approximately equal to its carrying value; however, due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years, no goodwill remains within our CRM reporting unit. Changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global CRM. Further, the recoverability of our CRM-related amortizable intangibles ($4.097 billion globally as of December 31, 2014) is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global CRM business performance. The $4.097 billion of CRM-related amortizable intangibles is at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods. An impairment of a material portion of our CRM-related amortizable intangibles carrying value would occur if the second step of the amortizable intangible test is required in a future reporting period. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testing.On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or small changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. 21Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our strategy to realign our business portfolio, we completed several acquisitions in 2014, 2013 and 2012 in our strategic growth areas and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future. Our integration of the operations of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, manufacturing, quality systems and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant amounts of management's time. Some of the factors that could affect the success of our acquisitions include, among others, the strength of the acquired companies' underlying technology and ability to execute, results of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures, the continued performance of critical transition services, our ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and retain key employees, and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies, such as increasing sales of our products, achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products. In addition, foreign acquisitions involve unique risks, including those related to integration of operations across different geographies, cultures, and languages; currency risks; and risks associated with the economic, political, and regulatory environment in specific countries. Our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business and our future growth. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so and if our acquisitions are not successful, we may record related asset impairment charges in the future.We may not be successful in our strategy relating to future strategic acquisitions of, investments in, or alliances with, other companies and businesses, which have been a significant source of historical growth for us, and will be key to our diversification into new markets and technologies.Our strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective, high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions, investments and alliances, we may be unable to grow our business. These acquisitions, investments and alliances have been a significant source of our growth. The success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions, investments or alliances will depend on a number of factors, including:•our ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance, if at all;•the ability of our due diligence process to uncover potential issues with target companies;•our ability to finance any future acquisition, investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us, if at all;•whether we are able to complete an acquisition, investment or alliance on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all; •our ability to successfully integrate and operate acquired businesses;•our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including foreign laws and regulations; and•intellectual property and litigation related to newly acquired technologies. Any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing, depending on their size or nature. 22We may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives; our long-term expense reduction programs may result in an increase in short-term expense; and our efforts may lead to unintended consequences. On an on-going basis we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make investments in research and development projects, capital and our people that we believe are important to our long-term success. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring and optimization initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. For example, in October 2013, we announced a restructuring initiative (the “2014 Restructuring plan”) intended to build on the progress we have made to address financial pressures in a changing global marketplace, further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiency and support new growth investments. Key activities under the 2014 Restructuring plan include continued implementation of our ongoing plant network optimization strategy (aimed at simplifying our manufacturing plant structure, reducing manufacturing costs and improving gross margins); continued focus on driving operational efficiencies; and ongoing business and commercial model changes. Other activities under the plan involve rationalizing organizational reporting structures to streamline various functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align resources to business strategies and marketplace dynamics. Activities under the plan were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2015.We estimate that the 2014 Restructuring plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $250 million to $300 million and reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $175 million to $225 million by the end of 2015. We expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. Expense reduction initiatives under the plan include various cost and efficiency improvement measures, which may include workforce reductions; the transfer of certain production lines and/or the closure of certain facilities and other efforts to streamline and better align resources of our business, among other actions. These measures could yield unintended consequences, such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce, inability to attract or retain key personnel, and reduced employee productivity. Attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce or a material decrease in employee morale or productivity could negatively affect our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, workforce reductions may subject us to the risk of litigation, which could result in substantial cost. Moreover, our restructuring and optimization initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results. We cannot guarantee that the activities under the 2014 Restructuring plan or other restructuring and optimization initiatives that we may undertake in the future will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings.Current domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Uncertainty about global economic conditions, including as a result of credit and sovereign debt issues, has caused and may continue to cause disruption in the financial markets, including diminished liquidity and credit availability. These conditions may adversely affect our suppliers, leading them to experience financial difficulties or to be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products, particularly capital equipment, or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, we have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries. Continued deterioration of the global economy or increase in sovereign debt issues may impact our ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain of those countries in the future. Third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt. This could result in terminations of, or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs. Such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding. Within Italy, Spain, and Portugal the number of days our receivables are outstanding continue to be above historical levels; however, the total balance outstanding for greater than 365 days has declined in the past 12 months.While we believe we have adequate allowances for doubtful accounts related to these accounts receivables, there can be no assurance that further deterioration in the global economy or increase in sovereign debt issues may not prevent collection of these accounts receivables and adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.The strength and timing of economic recovery remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy. Accordingly, we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions, including sovereign debt issues and increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the U.S. and abroad, may continue to negatively impact our average selling prices, net sales and profit margins, procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payors. In addition, conditions in the financial markets and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our ability to borrow money in the credit markets, access the capital markets and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes. 23Healthcare policy changes, including healthcare reform legislation, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payors, and other stakeholders may be significant and may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption. Moreover, there can be no assurance that our strategies will succeed for every product.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 were enacted into law in the U.S. in March 2010. As a U.S. headquartered company with significant sales in the United States, the medical device tax included in this law has materially affected us. The law imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. Other provisions of this law, including comparative effectiveness research, pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies and other changes to the payment systems, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for either our products and/or procedures using our products, reduce medical procedure volumes or increase cost containment pressures on us or others in the healthcare sector could adversely affect our business and results of operations.Healthcare cost containment pressures, government payment and delivery system reforms, changes in private payer policies, and marketplace consolidations could decrease the demand for our products, the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures performed using our devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payors, including governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the United States) and private health plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental third-party payors is critical to the success of medical technology companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies. Even if we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payors. Further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the United States, Japan, or other countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures, including price regulation, competitive bidding and tendering, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Third-party payors for hospital services globally continue to implement policies to contain healthcare costs. The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed, led to increased physician employment by hospitals in the U.S. hospital consolidation, and shifted services to the outpatient setting. Initiatives to limit the increase of healthcare costs, including price regulation, are also underway in several countries in which we do business. Hospitals or physicians may respond to these cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 24We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products. Our products, marketing, sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDC Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In the European Union, we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives (including the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive) and obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:•take a significant period of time;•require the expenditure of substantial resources;•involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance;•require changes to products; and•result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. In addition, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin or legal manufacturer first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where renewal or recertification applications are required, they may need to be renewed and/or approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements.Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent, and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations. Certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local preclinical and clinical data in addition to global data. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products, or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future.The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDC Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. 25Regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our business. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our products are continually subject to clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or other third parties, the results of which may be unfavorable, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market's perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.Our future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and enhancement of existing products, which requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals, all of which are very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in commercially viable products.In order to develop new products and enhance existing products, we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and businesses. The development of new products and enhance existing products requires significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate, and develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and abroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products, and gain and maintain market approval of our products. There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. If we are unable to develop and launch new products and enhanced products, our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted. Further, we are continuing to investigate, and have completed several acquisitions that involve opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into priority growth areas by accessing new products and technologies. There can be no assurance that our investments will be successful or we will be able to access new products and technologies on terms favorable to us, or that these products and technologies will achieve commercial feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of new products and technologies or our decision to reduce our investments may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth.The medical device industry and its customers are experiencing greater scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and are often the subject of numerous investigations, often involving marketing and other business practices or product quality issues including device recalls or advisories. These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings; imposition of substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, including corporate integrity agreements, stipulated judgments or exclusion; diversion of our employees and management's attention; imposition of administrative costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity; and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future. The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities continue to highly scrutize our industry. We have received subpoenas and other requests for information from Congress and other state and federal governmental agencies, including, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Defense, as well foreign governments and agencies. We have also received subpoenas and other requests for information from comparable international governmental agencies. These request and/or subpoenas relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance and product promotional practices. We have cooperated with these subpoenas and other requests for information, and expect to continue to do so in the future. We cannot predict when the matters will be resolved, the outcome of these matters or their impact on us, and cooperation may involve significant costs, including document production costs. An adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could include the commencement of an investigation, civil and criminal proceedings; substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, including exclusion from 26government reimbursement programs, entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies and amendments to existing CIAs. In addition, resolution of any of these matters could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations. For example, in 2009, we entered into a civil settlement with the DOJ regarding the DOJ's investigation relating to certain post-market surveys conducted by Guidant Corporation before we acquired Guidant in 2006. As part of the settlement, we entered into a CIA with the Office of Inspector General for HHS, which requires various provisions, including enhancements to certain compliance procedures related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers. Cooperation with requests and investigations from external agencies result in employee resource costs and diversion of employee focus. If any requests or investigations continue over a long period of time, could divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operations of our business and impose significant additional administrative burdens on us. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from these requests or investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.In addition, certain foreign governments, state governments (including that of Massachusetts, where we are headquartered) and the U.S. federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers. As an example, compliance with the U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires us by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals at the U.S. federal level made after August 1, 2013. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business. In addition, we have and may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement enhanced structure, policies, systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact our business.Further, Supreme Court case law has clarified that the FDA's authority over medical devices preempts certain state tort laws, but recently federal appeals courts have determined that some state tort law claims remain, and legislation has been introduced at the federal level to allow state intervention, all of which could lead to increased and inconsistent regulation at the state level.Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity.We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to on-going tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments related to transfer pricing methodology disputes. We have received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and Boston Scientific Corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years. Subsequent to issuing these Notices, the IRS conceded a portion of its original assessment. The total incremental tax liability now asserted by the IRS for the applicable periods is $1.162 billion plus interest. The primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. In addition, the IRS has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our Transaction Agreement with Abbott Laboratories pertaining to the sale of Guidant's vascular intervention business to Abbott in April 2006. We do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the IRS or its resulting assessment and we believe that the IRS has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated third-party agreement with Abbott. In addition, we believe that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations.We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed, or will timely file, petitions with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the Notices of Deficiency for the tax years in challenge. No payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. The IRS is currently examining the 2008 through 2010 tax years of Boston Scientific. During the first quarter of 2014 we were notified by the IRS of their intent to propose significant adjustments to our tax returns for these tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that are currently being contested in U.S. Tax Court for our tax years prior to 2008. As with the prior years, we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the IRS and we expect to contest any adjustments received through applicable IRS and judicial procedures, as appropriate. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. However, final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. 27There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves, and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. corporate tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our future results of operations. In addition, effective January 1, 2013 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act imposed a 2.3 percent excise tax on medical device manufacturers on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices. We recorded $72 million and $73 million of expenses within our selling, general and administrative expenses during 2014 and 2013, respectively, as a result of this excise tax.We may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Physician customers have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However, intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable and appellate courts can overturn lower court decisions. Furthermore, as our business increasingly relies on technology systems and infrastructure, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation.Competing parties in our industry frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies.Several third parties have asserted that our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. We have similarly asserted that products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us. Adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Patents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business, and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others. We currently own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending. We also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash, cross-licensing rights or royalty payments. No assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that any current or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors, or that our patents will not be found invalid. In addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade secrets or know-how or to assert them against claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful. We are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual property-related actions. The invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own, or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.In addition, the laws of certain countries in which we market, and plan on manufacturing some of our products in the near future, do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 28Furthermore, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access, and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other data, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber-attacks or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.Pending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.We operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and, in recent years, it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies in order to prevent the marketing of new devices. We are currently the subject of various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note K- Commitments and Contingencies to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial condition, results of operation or liquidity. Pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel. In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged, we may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us, if at all. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Pending and future product liability claims and other litigation, including private securities litigation, shareholder derivative suits and contract litigation, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or liquidity.The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. Many of the medical devices that we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell, including physician technique and experience in performing the surgical procedure, component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could result in product liability claims, a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.We are currently the subject of product liability litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note K- Commitments and Contingencies to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, including not only actual damages, but also punitive damages. The magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in the future, regardless of the outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Additionally, we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims, and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The fact that we do not maintain third-party insurance coverage for all categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions and these losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Any failure to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a medical device manufacturer, we are required to register our establishments and list our devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its Quality System Regulation requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the Federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA which may result in observations on Form 483, and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain International Standards Organization (ISO) certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by 29notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. Many other countries in which we do business have requirements similar to those of the US or the EU, and other foreign governments or agencies may subject us to periodic inspections as well. If we, or our manufacturers, fail to adhere to quality system regulations or ISO requirements, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. In most cases, the manufacturing of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. Factors such as a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand. In the event of a significant interruption, for example, as result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to needs for regulatory approvals. As a result, we may experience loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture, and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by third-party vendors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from third-party vendors. Certain of these materials and components are purchased from single sources due to quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors' manufacturing processes. A reduction or interruption in the supply of materials and components used in manufacturing our products; an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, particularly materials or components related to our CRM products and drug-eluting stent systems. In addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service. To the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity, availability of materials for sterilization, regulatory or other constraints, we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizer, sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Moreover, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) promulgated new rules applicable to public companies like us that use certain minerals and metals, known as conflict minerals, in their products. The rules require us to undertake measures to understand the origin and, as need be, source of conflict minerals within our supply chain and to disclose, among other things, those measures and whether or not any such conflict minerals originated from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. These requirements could, directly or indirectly, adversely affect the sourcing, availability and pricing of such minerals if they are found to be sourced from that region. In addition, we will incur additional costs to comply with the requirements, including with respect to measures undertaken to understand the origin and, as need be, source of conflict minerals used in our products. We rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and changing customer patterns. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients with our products or our proprietary information. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft 30of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Any of these events, in turn, may cause us to lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, be subject to legal claims and liability, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our share price has been volatile and may fluctuate, and accordingly, the value of an investment in our common stock may also fluctuate.Stock markets in general, and our common stock in particular, have experienced significant price and volume volatility over recent years. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due to factors described under this Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors,” as well as economic and geopolitical conditions general, and also to variability in the prevailing sentiment regarding our operations or business prospects, as well as, among other things, changing investment priorities of our stockholders. Since the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able sell their shares at attractive prices. If we are unable to attract, retain and focus key personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations. We constantly monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete; and we continue to assess opportunities to improve operational effectiveness and better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make needed investments, research and development projects, capital and our people that we believe are essential to our long-term success. In our industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate and we may face increased competition for such employees, particularly in emerging markets as the trend toward globalization continues. If we are unable to attract key personnel in a timely manner, including key sales and other personnel who have critical industry experience and relationships in the regions in which we operate, including in emerging markets, it may have an adverse effect on our business and our ability to drive growth, including through execution of our strategic initiatives. Furthermore, some of the key personnel for whom we compete have post-employment arrangements with their current or former employer that may impact our ability to hire them or expose us and them to claims. In addition, if we are unable to retain and focus our existing key personnel it may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations. Moreover, we recently completed changes in our senior management structure, which may lead to inefficiencies in our ability to execute our strategic, cost-reduction and efficiency initiatives, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.ITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Executive SummaryFinancial Highlights and TrendsIn 2014, we generated net sales of $7.380 billion, as compared to $7.143 billion in 2013, an increase of $237 million, or three percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $99 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2014, as compared to 2013 and sales related to our divested Neurovascular business declined $54 million in 2014. Refer to Note C - Divestitures included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on the Neurovascular divestiture. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $390 million, or six percent, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to constant currency increases in net sales from our Interventional Cardiology business of $97 million, from our Electrophysiology business of $74 million, from our Endoscopy business of $66 million, and from our Peripheral Interventions business of $56 million.1 Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our sales results.Our reported net loss in 2014 was $119 million, or $0.09 per share, and was driven primarily by litigation-related charges of $600 million ($386 million after-tax) recorded for the settlement agreement reached with Johnson & Johnson on February 13, 2015. See Note K - Commitments and Contingencies included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on the settlement agreement. Our reported results for 2014 included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits; restructuring- and litigation-related charges; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $1.248 billion, or $0.93 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2014 was $1.129 billion, or $0.84 per share1.Our reported net loss in 2013 was $121 million, or $0.09 per share. Our reported results for 2013 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges; restructuring- and litigation-related charges; debt extinguishment charges; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $1.112 billion, or $0.82 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2013 was $991 million, or $0.73 per share1. The following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) to those adjusted results considered by management.

Our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth and returning value to shareholders by buying back shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase authorizations discussed in Note L - Stockholders' Equity to our 2014 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. During 2014, we used $125 million of cash generated from operations to repurchase approximately 10 million shares of our common stock, as compared to 2013 in which $500 million of cash generated from operations was used to repurchase approximately 51 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2014, we had total debt of $4.262 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $587 million and working capital of $760 million. We hold investment-grade ratings with all three major credit-rating agencies. We believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy.Business and Market OverviewCardiovascularInterventional Cardiology Our Interventional Cardiology division develops, manufactures and markets technologies for diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders. Product offerings include coronary stents, including drug-eluting and bare metal stent systems, balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, crossing and re-entry devices for the treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels, diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging systems. We also offer structural heart products in certain international markets, which include a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and a device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation that are at risk for ischemic stroke.In May 2014, we launched our Promus PREMIER™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System in Japan, following regulatory approval by the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW). We had previously launched this technology in Europe and select other geographies during the first quarter of 2013, and in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2013. The Promus PREMIER™ Stent System is designed to provide physicians improved drug-eluting stent performance in treating patients with coronary artery disease, and features a unique customized platinum chromium alloy stent architecture and an enhanced stent delivery system. We also market our next generation SYNERGY™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System in select European and other Conformité Européenne (CE) Mark countries, which features an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating. During 2014, we continued to expand our commercial launch of this technology in Europe. The EVOLVE II clinical trial, which is designed to further assess the safety and effectiveness of the SYNERGY Stent System and support U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Japanese regulatory approvals for this technology, released results in November 2014. The results demonstrated the SYNERGY stent system met its primary endpoint in this non-inferiority study, which evaluated the one-year rate of target lesion failure. We expect FDA approval of this technology in late 2015.Our worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products were $2.057 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, or approximately 28 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products increased $60 million, or three percent, in 2014, as compared to 2013. Excluding the impact 37of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $37 million negative impact on our Interventional Cardiology net sales in 2014, as compared to 2013, net sales of these products increased $97 million, or five percent. Our drug-eluting coronary stent system sales represent a significant portion of our Interventional Cardiology net sales. The following are the components of our worldwide drug-eluting coronary stent system sales: Year Ended Year Ended(in millions) December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 U.S. International Total U.S. International TotalDrug-eluting coronary stents $486 $665 $1,151 $448 $665 $1,113The year-over-year increase in our worldwide Interventional Cardiology net sales was primarily related to sales of our Promus PREMIER™ Stent System in the U.S. and Japan, our SYNERGY™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System in select European and other CE Mark countries, our structural heart products in international markets, including the Lotus™ transcatheter aortic valve replacement system and the WATCHMAN® left atrial appendage closure device, along with operational growth in our other cardiology product lines, including our OptiCross™ Coronary Imaging Catheter, iLab® Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging System, and Polaris® Imaging System.Our structural heart product offerings include our Lotus™ Valve System, a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and our WATCHMAN® device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. The Lotus™ Valve System consists of a stent-mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve. In October 2013, we received CE Mark approval and launched the Lotus™ Valve System in Europe. In September 2014, we initiated the REPRISE III clinical trial with first patient enrollment. The initiation of the REPRISE III clinical trial marks the beginning of the process required to support FDA premarket approval. The WATCHMAN® Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology (WATCHMAN®) is the first device studied in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to warfarin, and is marketed in CE Mark countries and other international countries. In the U.S., we completed the 18 month follow-up PREVAIL trial and final five year follow-up in the PROTECT AF trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the WATCHMAN® device in patients with nonvalvular atrial fibrillation versus long-term warfarin therapy and are working towards approval of the device. On October 8, 2014, the FDA Circulatory Device Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee (the Panel) voted favorably (six yes to five no, with one abstention) that the benefits of the WATCHMAN® device outweigh the risks. The Panel also voted favorably (12 yes to zero no) on the reasonable assurance of safety while voting unfavorably (six yes to seven no, Chairman vote as tie-breaker) on the question of reasonable assurance of effectiveness. We are committed to working with the FDA to address the Panel’s comments and recommendations. We estimate FDA approval of this technology in the first half of 2015. Peripheral InterventionsOur Peripheral Interventions (PI) product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and other devices used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease. Our worldwide net sales of PI products were $850 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our worldwide net sales of PI products increased $41 million, or five percent, in 2014, as compared to 2013. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $15 million negative impact on our worldwide PI net sales in 2014, as compared to 2013, net sales of these products increased $56 million, or seven percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide PI net sales was primarily driven by growth in our core PI franchise, particularly our interventional oncology franchise, as well as revenues from the Interventional Division of Bayer AG (Bayer). On August 29, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the Interventional Division of Bayer for $414 million in cash. We believe that this acquisition enhances our ability to offer physicians and healthcare systems a more complete portfolio of solutions to treat challenging vascular conditions. The addition of Bayer's strong commercial organization and innovative technologies supports our strategy to provide a comprehensive portfolio of leading solutions to treat peripheral vascular disease. The transaction includes the leading AngioJet® Thrombectomy System and the Fetch® 2 Aspiration Catheter, which are used in endovascular procedures to remove blood clots from blocked arteries and veins, and the JetStream® Atherectomy System, used in an innovative and fast-growing therapy to remove plaque and thrombi from diseased arteries. 38During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed the acquisition of Vessix, a developer of catheter-based renal denervation systems for the treatment of resistant hypertension. Through the acquisition of Vessix, we added a highly differentiated technology to our hypertension strategy and launched this technology in Europe in May 2013. We have seen a slowdown in the resistant hypertension market in Europe following the failure of a competitor's large randomized clinical trial, which was announced during the first quarter of 2014. During the first half of 2014, based on a careful examination of the available data, we determined that additional clinical research was required before we pursue a large, global pivotal trial. In December 2014, we agreed upon a study protocol with the FDA for an innovative Investigational Device Exemption trial called REDUCE-HTN REINFORCE. The trial is designed to isolate the effects of our Vessix renal denervation system while minimizing the impact of multiple medications and patient compliance. As a result of changes in our clinical strategy and lower estimates of the European and global hypertension markets, we reduced our expectations for future revenue and recorded impairment charges related to the Vessix technology intangible assets during 2014. See Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further details.Rhythm ManagementCardiac Rhythm ManagementOur CRM division develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices including implantable cardioverter defibrillator systems and pacemaker systems that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities. Our worldwide net sales of CRM products were $1.912 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, or approximately 26 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our worldwide net sales of CRM products increased $26 million, or one percent, in 2014, as compared to 2013. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $14 million negative impact on our CRM net sales in 2014, as compared to 2013, net sales of these products increased $40 million, or two percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide CRM net sales was primarily driven by increases in our denovo ICD market share as a result of our subcutaneous implantable cardiac defibrillator (S-ICD) technology and our new line of defibrillators; partially offset by lower volumes of replacement procedures and implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) market share losses in certain regions.The following are the components of our worldwide CRM net sales: Year Ended Year Ended(in millions) December 31, 2014 December 31, 2013 U.S. International Total U.S. International TotalDefibrillator systems $867 $513 $1,380 $850 $505 $1,355Pacemaker systems 255 277 532 267 264 531CRM products $1,122 $790 $1,912 $1,117 $769 $1,886In February 2014, our European business initiated the full launch of our new X4 line of quadripolar CRT-D systems, including the AUTOGEN™ X4, DYNAGEN™ X4, and INOGEN™ X4 cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (CRT-Ds), a suite of ACUITY™ X4 quadripolar LV leads and the ACUITY™ PRO lead delivery system. In addition, in April 2014, we received FDA approval for the DYNAGEN™ MINI and INOGEN™ MINI ICDs, the smallest fully-powered standard longevity ICD on the market, as well as the DYNAGEN™ X4 and INOGEN™ X4 CRT-Ds. These new defibrillators were launched in the U.S. during the second quarter of 2014 and our global roll-out of this new line of defibrillators will continue into 2015. In addition, our new EL (extended longevity) line of ICDs, was launched in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2015. We also completed U.S. phase I enrollment in our Quadripolar lead clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2014. We expect FDA approval of this lead in the first half of 2016.Our pacemaker system net sales remained relatively flat during 2014, as compared to 2013. Our international pacemaker business grew primarily due to the continued adoption of our INGENIO™ family of pacemakers. This was offset by a decline in the U.S. pacemaker business primarily driven by price erosion. We are encouraged by physician feedback on our next generation Ingevity family of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible pacing leads in select international markets. Ingevity™ MRI pacing leads are part of the ImageReady™ MR-conditional pacemaker system, which includes VITALIO™ MRI, FORMIO™ MRI, ADVANTIO™ MRI and INGENIO™ MRI pulse generators. When used with the LATITUDE™ NXT Patient Management System, these devices wirelessly monitor patients for conditions such as atrial arrhythmias. We commenced the U.S. Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) trial for the Ingevity™ MRI pacing lead during February 2013. During the second half of 2014, we also received FDA approval of our new ACCOLADE™ family of pacemakers, the second generation of INGENIO pacemakers, and cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers, including a quadripolar header design. We expect to initiate a full launch of this technology in 2015. 39During the second quarter of 2012, we completed the acquisition of Cameron Health, Inc. (Cameron). Cameron developed the world's first and only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator, the S-ICD® System, which we believe is a differentiated technology that will provide us the opportunity to both increase our market share in the existing ICD market and expand that market over time. The first generation S-ICD® System has received CE Mark and FDA approval. We became supply constrained in early 2013 and were only able to provide a very limited supply of S-ICD® systems during the second and third quarters of 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we resumed our launch of our S-ICD® System and have seen strong physician and patient interest in this differentiated technology. We are also developing the Emblem S-ICD® System, a next generation S-ICD® System that is smaller in size and offers improved battery longevity and remote monitoring capabilities. We expect to receive regulatory approvals and to initiate a full launch of the Emblem S-ICD® technology in Europe and the U.S. by the end of 2015.ElectrophysiologyOur Electrophysiology business develops less-invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart. Our leading products include the Blazer™ line of ablation catheters, designed to deliver enhanced performance and responsiveness. Our worldwide net sales of Electrophysiology products were $227 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or approximately three percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our worldwide net sales of Electrophysiology products increased $72 million, or 47 percent, in 2014, as compared to 2013. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $2 million negative impact on our Electrophysiology net sales in 2014, as compared to 2013, net sales of these products increased $74 million, or 48 percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide Electrophysiology net sales was driven by our acquisition of the electrophysiology business of C.R. Bard Inc. (Bard EP), which we completed on November 1, 2013. Through our acquisition of Bard EP, we obtained a strong commercial team and complementary portfolio of ablation catheters, diagnostic tools, and electrophysiology recording systems, which we believe allows us to better serve the global Electrophysiology market through a more comprehensive portfolio offering and sales infrastructure. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we completed the acquisition of Rhythmia Medical, Inc. (Rhythmia), a developer of next-generation mapping and navigation solutions for use in cardiac catheter ablations and other electrophysiology procedures, including atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. During the third quarter of 2014, we initiated our limited launch of the Rhythmia next-generation mapping and navigation solution in both the U.S. and Europe.We believe that the Rhythmia and Bard EP acquisitions, as well as our other expected product launches, will help to position us to participate more competitively in the growing Electrophysiology market.MedSurgEndoscopyOur Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. Our worldwide net sales of Endoscopy products were $1.323 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, or approximately 18 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our worldwide net sales of Endoscopy products increased $43 million, or three percent, in 2014, as compared to 2013. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $23 million impact on our Endoscopy net sales in 2014, as compared to 2013, net sales of these products increased $66 million, or five percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide Endoscopy net sales was primarily driven by growth across several of our key product franchises, including our biliary device franchise with continued growth of our ExpectTM Endoscopic Ultrasound Aspiration Needle and our metal stent franchise driven by our Biliary WallFlex® product family, and our hemostasis franchise with products such as our Resolution Clip for gastrointestinal bleeding. Urology and Women’s HealthOur Urology and Women’s Health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and gynecological disorders. Our worldwide net sales of Urology and Women's health products were $535 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or approximately seven percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our worldwide net sales of Urology and Women's health products increased $30 million, or six percent, in 2014, as compared to 2013. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $7 million impact on our Urology and Women's health net sales in 2014, as compared to 2013, net sales of these products increased $37 million, or seven percent. The year -over-year increase in worldwide Urology and Women's Health net sales was primarily attributable to growth in our Urology franchise as we continue to expand our international business. 40On May 7, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the remaining fully diluted equity of IoGyn, Inc. (IoGyn). IoGyn has developed the SymphionTM System, a next generation system for hysteroscopic intrauterine tissue removal including fibroids (myomas) and polyps. In March 2014, IoGyn received U.S. FDA approval for the system and in October 2014, we launched the system in the United States. NeuromodulationOur Neuromodulation business offers the Precision® and Precision SpectraTM Spinal Cord Stimulator systems, used for the management of chronic pain. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products were $472 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, or approximately six percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2014. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products increased $19 million, or four percent, in 2014, as compared to 2013. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $1 million impact on our Neuromodulation net sales in 2014, as compared to 2013, net sales of these products increased $20 million, or five percent. The year-over-year increase in our worldwide Neuromodulation net sales was primarily driven by sales of our Precision Spectra System. The Precision Spectra System is the world's first and only spinal cord stimulation (SCS) system with 32 contacts and 32 dedicated power sources and is designed to provide improved pain relief to a wide range of patients who suffer from chronic pain. Significant changes to Medicare reimbursement for physician office trialing of SCS systems went into effect January 1, 2014, resulting in slower trialing volumes, which are typically a leading indicator of total SCS market growth. Due to these changes in reimbursement and lower market growth rates, as well as the higher prior year growth connected with the 2013 launch of Precision Spectra™, our revenue growth rate slowed throughout 2014. We have CE Mark approval for use of our Vercise™ Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, Tremor and intractable primary and secondary dystonia, a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions, in Europe. During 2013, we began our U.S. pivotal trial for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. We believe we have an exciting opportunity in DBS with the Vercise™ DBS System, which is designed to selectively stimulate targeted areas of the brain to customize therapy for patients and minimize side effects of unwanted stimulation.Emerging MarketsAs part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, described in Item 1 of this Annual Report, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in Emerging Markets. We define Emerging Markets as including 20 developing countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors, and our global capabilities. We are seeking to expand our presence and strengthen relationships in order to grow net sales and market share within our Emerging Markets, and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities. Our Emerging Markets revenue grew 12 percent, as compared to the prior year, and was approximately ten percent of our consolidated net sales in 2014. Neurovascular DivestitureIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.500 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion during 2011, $10 million during 2012, $30 million during 2013 and the final amount due to us in 2014. After the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker, we provided transitional services through a transition services agreement, and also manufactured and supplied products to Stryker through a supply agreement. These transition services and supply agreements substantially ended during 2013. Our sales related to our divested Neurovascular business have declined as the various transition services and supply agreements have terminated. We expect revenue from our divested Neurovascular business to be immaterial in 2015. Due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the Neurovascular business, the divestiture does not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. Divestiture-related gains or charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. See Results of Operations below and Note C - Divestitures to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.Restructuring InitiativesOn an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and we assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital, our people and other programs that we believe are important to drive our growth. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. Additional information can be found in Results of Operations below and Note H – Restructuring-related Activities to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. 41Healthcare PoliciesPolitical, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation); coverage and payment policies; comparative effectiveness of therapies; technology assessments; and health care delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payors, and other stakeholders may be significant and may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. Certain provisions of the law have yet to be implemented and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not yet fully understood; therefore, it is unclear what the full impact will be from the law. The legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. We recorded $72 million and $73 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively, within our selling, general and administrative expenses. Other provisions of this law, including Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and will place a significant emphasis on clinical and economic data to demonstrate efficacy and justify the economic benefits of technology purchases.We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations (ACOs) continue to take shape globally. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan and Europe and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products, which in turn may influence a hospital’s or physician's selection of products used to treat patients. In addition, in Japan, the government reviews reimbursement rate benchmarks every two years, which may significantly reduce reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or deny coverage for those procedures. We expect the next reimbursement rate update in Japan to be completed and take effect for the majority of our businesses during the second quarter of 2016.Any changes in government policies that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes in countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally.Results of OperationsNet SalesEffective January 1, 2013, we reorganized our business from geographic regions to fully operationalized global business units. We have three new global reportable segments comprised of Cardiovascular, Rhythm Management, and MedSurg. We have restated the 2012 information to conform to our new segment presentation.We manage our global businesses on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. Management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using standard internal currency exchange rates held constant for each year. The following table provides our worldwide net sales by global business and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. Net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and net sales from divested businesses are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Refer to Additional Information of this Item 7 for a further discussion of management’s use of this non-GAAP financial measure. 42 2014 versus 2013 2013 versus 2012 Year EndedDecember 31, As ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasis As ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasis(in millions)201420132012 (restated)(restated) Interventional Cardiology$2,057$1,997$2,179 3 %5 % (8)%(6)%Peripheral Interventions850809787 5 %7 % 3 %5 %Cardiovascular2,9072,8062,966 4 %5 % (5)%(3)% Cardiac Rhythm Management1,9121,8861,908 1 %2 % (1)%— %Electrophysiology227155147 47 %48 % 5 %6 %Rhythm Management2,1392,0412,055 5 %6 % (1)%— % Endoscopy1,3231,2801,239 3 %5 % 3 %7 %Urology and Women’s Health535505500 6 %7 % 1 %3 %Neuromodulation472453367 4 %5 % 23 %24 %MedSurg2,3302,2382,106 4 %5 % 6 %9 % Subtotal Core Businesses7,3767,0857,127 4 %6 % (1)%2 %Divested Businesses458122 (91)%(91)% (53)%(52)%Worldwide$7,380$7,143$7,249 3 %5 % (1)%1 %We restated worldwide sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2013 and the twelve months ended December 31, 2012 to reflect the realignment of certain product lines from Endoscopy to Peripheral Interventions as of January 1, 2014, which amounts were not material.The constant currency growth rates in the table above can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note O - Segment Reporting to our 2014 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Growth rates are based on actual, non-rounded amounts and may not recalculate precisely. Refer to Executive Summary for further discussion of our net sales and a comparison of our 2014 and 2013 net sales.In 2013, we generated net sales of $7.143 billion, as compared to $7.249 billion in 2012, a decrease of $106 million, or one percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $156 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2013 as compared to 2012 and sales related to our divested Neurovascular business declined $64 million in 2013. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $114 million, or two percent, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to constant currency increases in net sales from our Endoscopy business of $87 million, from our Neuromodulation business of $87 million, and from our Peripheral Interventions business of $41 million. These increases were partially offset by a constant currency decrease in net sales from our Interventional Cardiology business of $121 million. 43Gross ProfitOur gross profit was $5.170 billion in 2014, $4.969 billion in 2013, and $4.900 billion in 2012. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased to 70.1 percent in 2014, as compared to 69.6 percent in 2013 and 67.6 percent in 2012. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period: Year EndedDecember 31, 20142013Gross profit - prior year69.6 %67.6 %Manufacturing cost reductions1.8 %1.9 %Neurovascular divestiture0.4 %0.5 %Sales mix and pricing(1.5)%(0.9)%All other, including other inventory charges, other period expense and net impact of foreign currency(0.2)%0.5 %Gross profit - current year70.1 %69.6 %The increase in our gross profit margin for 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs, as well as the positive impacts of lower sales related to our divested businesses, as these sales are at significantly lower gross profit margins. Partially offsetting these factors was the negative impact of pricing related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products, as well as changes in the mix of our product sales. In addition, during the second quarter of 2013, we recorded a $16 million credit to cost of products sold related to the final retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our PROMUS® supply arrangement with Abbott for historical purchases of PROMUS® stent systems, the impact of which is included in the ""all other"" caption in the table above.The increase in our gross profit margin for 2013, as compared to 2012, is primarily the result of cost reductions from our restructuring and process improvement programs. Our gross profit margin was also positively impacted by lower sales related to our divested businesses. In addition, our 2013 gross profit margins were positively impacted by the final retroactive pricing adjustment pursuant to our PROMUS® supply arrangement with Abbott, which is included in the ""all other"" caption in the table above. Partially offsetting these factors was the negative impact of pricing and sales mix related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products. Operating ExpensesThe following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 % of Net % of Net % of Net(in millions) $Sales $Sales $SalesSelling, general and administrative expenses 2,90239.3% 2,67437.4% 2,53535.0%Research and development expenses 81711.1% 86112.0% 88612.2%Royalty expense 1111.5% 1402.0% 1532.1%Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) ExpensesIn 2014, our SG&A expenses increased $228 million, or nine percent, as compared to 2013, and were 190 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. This increase was driven primarily by SG&A increases related to business combinations that we have completed over the last several years, product launches and other commercial and corporate programs, variable employee-related benefits and our expansion efforts in emerging markets, partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives.In 2013, our SG&A expenses increased $139 million, or five percent, as compared to 2012, and were 240 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. This increase was driven primarily by our increased investment related to acquisitions, strategic growth initiatives, and expansion efforts in emerging markets, as well as $73 million of expense associated with the new excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices that went into effect January 1, 2013. Partially offsetting these increases were declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. 44Research and Development (R&D) ExpensesIn 2014, our R&D expenses decreased $44 million, or five percent, as compared to 2013, and were 90 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease was due primarily to the benefits from our initiatives to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient, as well as the timing of certain R&D programs. We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth.In 2013, our R&D expenses decreased $25 million, or approximately three percent, as compared to 2012, and were 20 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease was due primarily to our cost reduction initiatives associated with our restructuring programs and the benefits from our strategy to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient. Partially offsetting the decrease was R&D funding for our acquisitions. Royalty ExpenseIn 2014, our royalty expense decreased $29 million, or 21 percent, as compared to 2013, and was 50 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to the renegotiation of a royalty agreement in the second quarter of 2014 that resulted in a lower royalty rate structure.In 2013, our royalty expense decreased $13 million, or nine percent, as compared to 2012, and was ten basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease related primarily to lower sales of our royalty-bearing products within our Interventional Cardiology business.Amortization ExpenseOur amortization expense was $438 million in 2014, as compared to $410 million in 2013, an increase of $28 million or seven percent. This increase was due primarily to amortizable intangible assets acquired during the fourth quarter of 2013 and during 2014.Amortization expense was $410 million in 2013, as compared to $395 million in 2012, an increase of $15 million or four percent. This increase was due primarily to intangible assets associated with acquisitions we completed in the fourth quarter of 2012 and the electrophysiology business of C.R. Bard, Inc., which we acquired in the fourth quarter of 2013. Amortization expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Goodwill & Intangible Asset Impairment ChargesWe have recorded intangible asset impairment charges, including impairments of in-process research and development, of $195 million in 2014, $53 million in 2013 and $142 million in 2012.In 2013, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $423 million following our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units on January 1, 2013. In 2012, we recorded total goodwill impairment charges of $4.350 billion, the majority of which related to our former Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) reporting unit. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2014.See Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional details related to our goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates for a discussion of key assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. Goodwill impairment charges and intangible asset impairment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Contingent Consideration ExpenseWe recorded a net benefit related to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities of $85 million in 2014, a net expense of $4 million in 2013 and a net benefit of $6 million in 2012. See Note B – Acquisitions to our 2014 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our contingent consideration expense associated with our acquisitions. Contingent consideration expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. 45Restructuring-related Activities and ChargesWe recorded restructuring charges pursuant to our restructuring plan of $69 million during 2014, $101 million during 2013, and $136 million during 2012. In addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of out accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $48 million during 2014, $23 million during 2013, and $24 million during 2012.2014 Restructuring PlanAs of December 31, 2014, we have recorded costs of $142 million under the 2014 Restructuring Plan, of which $94 million has been recorded as restructuring charges and the remaining portion has been recorded through other lines within our consolidated statement of operations. We estimate that the 2014 Restructuring plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $250 million to $300 million and reduce gross annual pre-tax operating expenses by approximately $175 million to $225 million by the end of 2015, which is when we expect the plan will be substantially complete. We expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. Other Restructuring PlansOur other restructuring plans, including our 2011 Restructuring Plan, 2010 Restructuring Plan and our Plant Optimization Program were substantially completed in years prior to 2014.We made cash payments of $112 million in 2014, $141 million in 2013, and $149 million in 2012 associated with our restructuring initiatives. Restructuring and restructuring-related costs are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.See Note H - Restructuring-related Activities to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our restructuring plans and activities.Litigation-related Charges and CreditsWe recorded net litigation-related charges in the amount of $1.036 billion, $221 million and $192 million, during 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The charges recorded in 2014 included a $600 million charge related to the agreement between our subsidiary, Guidant Corporation (Guidant) and Johnson & Johnson signed on February 13, 2015, to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by Johnson & Johnson, stemming from our acquisition of Guidant. In exchange, we have agreed to make aggregate payments totaling $600 million to Johnson & Johnson. These charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants. See Note K - Commitments and Contingencies to our 2014 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional discussion of our litigation-related matters.Gain on DivestitureIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $12 million during 2014, a gain of $38 million during 2013 and a gain of $15 million during 2012 associated with the transaction. These divestiture-related gains are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Interest ExpenseOur interest expense decreased to $216 million in 2014, as compared to $324 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to $70 million of debt extinguishment charges, representing premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of accelerated amortization of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.450 billion of debt during the third quarter of 2013. Debt extinguishment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Our average borrowing rate was 4.8 percent in 2014, as compared to 6.9 percent in 2013, which includes the impact of the debt extinguishment charges. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note F – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2014 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations. 46Our interest expense increased to $324 million in 2013, as compared to $261 million in 2012. The increase was primarily due to $70 million of debt extinguishment charges discussed above, which were recorded during the third quarter of 2013. Including the debt extinguishment charges, our average borrowing rate was 6.9 percent in 2013 and 5.5 percent in 2012.Other, netOur other, net reflected income of $8 million in 2014, expense of $19 million in 2013, and income of $22 million in 2012. The following are the components of other, net: Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201420132012Interest income $5$6$5Foreign currency losses (18)(11)(18)Net gains (losses) on investments 27(9)37Other expense, net (6)(5)(2) $8$(19)$22During 2014, we recognized gains of $19 million associated with the acquisition of IoGyn, Inc. related to previously held investments and other net gains related to our investment portfolio of $8 million. During 2013, we recognized losses on investments of $9 million due to $7 million in investment impairments and $2 million for equity method adjustments on investments. During 2012, we recognized gains of $39 million associated with Cameron in which we held prior equity interests, which were partially offset by net losses of $2 million related to our investment portfolio. The acquisition-related gains from previously held investments are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Tax RateThe following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Year EndedDecember 31, 201420132012Reported tax rate 76.7 %46.0 %(1.0)%Impact of certain receipts/charges* (64.5)%(35.4)%12.7 % 12.2 %10.6 %11.7 %*These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.The change in our reported tax rate for 2014, as compared to 2013 and 2012, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. In 2014, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits, and litigation- and restructuring-related charges. Our reported tax rate for 2014 was also affected by discrete tax items primarily related to resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to change in uncertain tax positions due to a favorable court ruling, offset by a charge due to translation gain on previously taxed income. In 2013, these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges, litigation- and restructuring-related charges, and debt extinguishment charges. Our reported tax rate for 2013 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied. In 2012, these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits, and litigation- and restructuring-related charges. Our reported tax rate for 2012 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from an unfavorable court ruling. Excluding the impact of these receipts and charges in 2014, 2013 and 2012, the change in our reported tax rate between years is primarily the result of shifts in the geographic mix of our business. We have received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and Boston Scientific Corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years. We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we have filed, or will timely file, petitions with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the Notices of Deficiency for the tax years in challenge. No payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. The IRS is currently examining the 2008 through 2010 tax 47years of Boston Scientific. During 2014, we received a Revenue Agent Report from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reflecting significant proposed audit adjustments for our 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that are currently being contested in the U.S. Tax Court for our tax years 2001-2007. As with prior years, we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the IRS and we expect to contest any adjustments received through appropriate IRS and judicial procedures, as appropriate. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate as of December 31, 2014. However, final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Also, in connection with the IRS issues, a number of agreed adjustments were contained in the IRS report and no tax was paid on these amounts as the U.S. Tax Court case is still pending. However, the amounts were reclassified from our uncertain tax positions to long-term payable as these items have been agreed to and are no longer uncertain. See Note J - Income Taxes to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our tax rate and our tax court disputes.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesBased on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, fund possible mergers and/or acquisitions, service our existing debt and return value to investors through potential share repurchases for the next twelve months. On February 13, 2015, we signed an agreement with Johnson & Johnson to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by Johnson & Johnson against Guidant, stemming from our acquisition of Guidant. As a result of the settlement agreement, Johnson & Johnson agreed to dismiss permanently its action without acknowledgment of liability by Guidant. In exchange, we have agreed to make aggregate payments totaling $600 million to Johnson & Johnson. Under the terms of the agreement, we agreed to pay Johnson & Johnson $300 million within 10 days of the date of the agreement and an additional $300 million within 60 days of the date of the agreement. We expect to fund these payments through cash on hand, cash from our continuing operations and our revolving credit facility. See Note K - Commitments and Contingencies for additional information on the settlement agreement.As of December 31, 2014, we had $587 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $151 million invested in money market and government funds and $436 million in short-term time deposits and interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We also have full access to our $2.000 billion revolving credit facility and $300 million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables, both described below.The following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012: Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201420132012Cash provided by operating activities $1,269$1,110$1,280Cash used for investing activities (745)(475)(579)Cash used for financing activities (150)(624)(764)Operating ActivitiesDuring 2014, we generated $1.269 billion from operating activities, as compared to $1.110 billion in 2013, an increase of $159 million or 14 percent. This increase was primarily due to reductions in our accounts receivable due to a government funded settlement of outstanding receivables in Spain during 2014 and lower payments related to interest and costs associated with debt extinguishment; partially offset by increases in our inventory levels and higher payments related to contingent consideration.During 2013, we generated $1.110 billion from operating activities, as compared to $1.280 billion in 2012, a decrease of $170 million, or 13 percent. This decrease was primarily due to the impact of increased levels of accounts receivable of approximately $100 million, costs related to debt extinguishment of approximately $70 million and net payments associated with litigation of approximately $50 million; partially offset by a final cash receipt associated with our Promus® supply agreement with Abbott. 48Investing ActivitiesDuring 2014, cash used for investing activities was $745 million. Our investing activities included $486 million of payments for the acquisitions of IoGyn, and the Interventional Division of Bayer, net of cash acquired. Cash used for investing activities also included purchases of property, plant and equipment of $259 million. This was partially offset by proceeds related to our divested businesses of $12 million. During 2013, cash used for investing activities was $475 million. Our investing activities included capital expenditures of $245 million and a $274 million payment for the acquisition of C.R. Bard's electrophysiology business. These expenditures were partially offset by $53 million of proceeds received from the sale of our Natick, Massachusetts headquarters in 2013. During 2012, cash used for investing activities was $579 million. Our investing activities included capital expenditures of $226 million and payments for the acquisitions of Cameron Health Inc., Bridgepoint Medical Inc., Rhythmia Medical Inc., and Vessix Vascular Inc., totaling $366 million. Financing ActivitiesOur cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and repurchases of common stock pursuant to our authorized repurchase programs, discussed in Note L - Stockholders' Equity to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, our financing activities included $34 million of contingent payments in 2014, $160 million of payments in 2013 and $146 million of payments in 2012 associated with our previous acquisitions.Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic conditions, adverse litigation outcomes and other risk and uncertainties that could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and adversely affect our liquidity plans. DebtWe hold investment-grade ratings with all three major credit-rating agencies. We believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy. We had total debt of $4.262 billion as of December 31, 2014 and $4.240 billion as of December 31, 2013 which consisted of the following:Credit FacilitiesWe maintain a $2.000 billion revolving credit facility, maturing in April 2017, with a global syndicate of commercial banks. There were no amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2014 or December 31, 2013. We also maintain a $300 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables maturing in June 2015, subject to further extension. We had no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013.Term LoanIn August 2013, we entered into a new $400 million, unsecured term loan facility. We had $400 million outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2014. Our revolving credit facility and our term loan facility require that we maintain certain financial covenants as outlined in Note F - Borrowings and Credit Agreements to our 2014 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As of and through December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Any inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facility or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers. Senior Notes 49We had senior notes outstanding of $3.800 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. Our senior notes are publicly registered securities, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to borrowings under our credit and security facility and liabilities of our subsidiaries.The debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2014 is as follows: (in millions)2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter TotalSenior Notes$400 $600 $250 $600 $— $1,950 $3,800Term Loan— 80 80 240 — — 400 $400 $680 $330 $840 $— $1,950 $4,200Note:The table above does not include unamortized discounts associated with our senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes.Other ArrangementsWe have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries that we account for as sales under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. These agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties, without recourse, of up to approximately $363 million as of December 31, 2014. We de-recognized $167 million of receivables as of December 31, 2014 at an average interest rate of 3.2 percent, and $146 million as of December 31, 2013 at an average interest rate of 3.3 percent. In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with a commercial Japanese bank that provide for borrowings, promissory notes discounting and receivables factoring of up to 21.000 billion Japanese yen (approximately $175 million as of December 31, 2014). We de-recognized $134 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2014 at an average interest rate of 1.8 percent and $147 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2013 at an average interest rate of 1.8 percent.As of December 31, 2014, we had outstanding letters of credit of $59 million, as compared to $78 million as of December 31, 2013, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers' compensation insurance arrangements. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees.For additional details related to our debt, including our revolving credit facility, term loan, senior notes and other arrangements, see Note F - Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.EquityDuring 2014 we received $60 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $74 million in 2013 and $21 million 2012. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.We repurchased 10 million shares of our common stock for $125 million during 2014, 51 million shares for $500 million during 2013, and 105 million shares for $600 million during 2012. As of December 31, 2014, we had remaining approximately $535 million authorized under our 2013 share repurchase program. There were approximately 248 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2014 and 238 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2013.Stock-based compensation expense related to our stock equity compensation and ownership plans was $103 million in 2014, $105 million in 2013, and $108 million in 2012. Stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors: the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period; forfeiture levels related to unvested awards; and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2014. 50 (in millions) 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 Thereafter TotalLong-term debt obligations $400 $680 $330 $840 $— $1,950 $4,200Interest payments (1) 220 175 144 134 116 934 1,723Litigation Settlements 600 — — — — — 600Lease obligations (1) 59 51 34 25 21 28 218Purchase obligations (1) 183 17 — — 1 5 206Minimum royalty obligations (1) 2 2 4 7 10 29 54Unrecognized tax benefits 4 — — — — — 4 $1,468 $925 $512 $1,006 $148 $2,946 $7,005(1)In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.The amounts in the table above with respect to lease obligations represent amounts pursuant to contractual arrangements for the lease of property, plant and equipment used in the normal course of business. Litigation settlements relate to the settlement agreement between Guidant and Johnson & Johnson, signed on February 13, 2015. Purchase obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.047 billion the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note J – Income Taxes to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits.With certain of our acquisitions, we acquired in-process research and development projects that require future funding to complete the projects. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the in-process research and development projects we acquired is between $100 million and $150 million. Net cash inflows from the projects currently in development are expected to commence in 2015 through 2018, following the respective launches of these technologies in the U.S., Europe and Japan regions. Certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B – Acquisitions to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2014.Legal MattersFor a discussion of our material legal proceedings see Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require management’s judgment: Revenue Recognition, Bad Debt Reserves, Inventory Provisions, Valuation of Contingent Consideration Liabilities and Intangible Assets (including CRM-related Amortizable Intangible Assets), Goodwill Valuation, Legal and Product Liability Accruals and Income Taxes.See Note A-Significant Accounting Policies to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information related to our accounting policies and our consideration of these areas critical accounting areas. In addition, see Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion on the valuation of goodwill and intangibles (including CRM-related amortizable intangibles), Note J -Income Taxes for further discussion on income tax related matters and Note K - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion on legal and product liability matters. 51Revenue RecognitionWe allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.Many of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE® Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period. We do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations; therefore, we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available; otherwise, we use our best estimate of selling price. We allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.Inventory ProvisionsWe base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration LiabilitiesWe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including in-process research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations, amortization expense, and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods.We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable,we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets; and, we review our indefinite-lived assets for classification and impairment more frequently if changes in circumstances or indicators exist. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value. 52Valuation of CRM-related Amortizable Intangible AssetsCertain of our amortizable intangible assets that relate to our CRM business are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the amortizable intangible recoverability test in future reporting periods. Key assumptions we have made in determining the recoverability of these assets include how we grouped our assets for purposes of measuring cash flows, the estimated life of those cash flows and our expectations for the amount of cash flows generated by these assets over their remaining useful life. For purposes of testing the CRM-related amortizable intangible assets, we grouped the intangible assets with the other assets and liabilities of the global CRM reporting unit, as a result of having identified the CRM reporting unit as the lowest level of identifiable cash flows because our CRM core technology, which is the primary asset within the CRM asset group, is utilized by all CRM revenue-generating products. As a result, we include cash flows generated by our CRM products in our recoverability analysis through the core technology useful life, which is estimated to end in 2031. We determined the useful life of the core technology based on our expectation of the period during which the technology is expected to contribute to the cash flows of our business. Our core technology represents know-how, patented and unpatented technology, testing methodologies and hardware that is integral to our current and future CRM product generations. This core technology includes battery and capacitor technology, lead technology, software algorithms and interfacing for shocking and pacing used in each therapy franchise. The recoverability of our CRM-related amortizable intangible assets is sensitive to future cash flow assumptions and our global CRM business performance. The amount of future cash flows within our recoverability analysis include our future projections of revenue, expenses and capital expenditures, which are based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. These future cash flow assumptions consider the significant investments we have made to renew the CRM reporting unit's product portfolio within its existing core franchises and to develop what we believe to be unique innovative solutions that utilize our core technology; the increased impact to the CRM reporting unit from emerging markets; and demographic trends toward an aging population. Further, while our CRM revenue declined in 2012 and 2013 as a result of factors specific to our CRM business and contraction in the overall CRM market; our CRM business grew one percent in 2014, we believe our CRM revenue will experience low growth over the remaining useful life of our CRM amortizing intangible assets. We continue to perform thorough reviews of the CRM market and our recent business results within the market, and consider the impacts on future expectations of performance to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life of our CRM-related amortizable intangible assets.Goodwill ValuationWe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the assessment, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. For our 2014 and 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units, including Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Women's Health and Neuromodulation. During 2014, 2013, and 2012, we used only the income approach, specifically the DCF method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows 53within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units’ future expected cash flows.If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative, we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. If we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists, we then perform the second step of the goodwill test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value.Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.In the second quarter of 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test. As a result of the 2014 annual goodwill impairment test, we identified our global Neuromodulation and global Electrophysiology reporting units as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. As of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, our global Neuromodulation reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 55 percent and held $1.356 billion of allocated goodwill. As of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, our global Electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 38 percent and held $292 million of allocated goodwill. During the fourth quarter of 2014, due to changes in our expectations of the timing and amount of future revenue and cash flow related to our Electrophysiology reporting unit, we performed an interim goodwill impairment test on this reporting unit. Based on this assessment, we concluded that the fair value of the Electrophysiology reporting unit exceeded its carrying value; however the level of excess fair value over the carrying value had declined to approximately 26 percent. Our global Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) reporting unit had a fair value approximately equal to its carrying value; however, due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years, no goodwill remains within our CRM reporting unit. Changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units including global CRM. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. The key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units and amortizable intangibles are estimated revenue growth rates and levels of profitability. Terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC rate applied are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges. For example, based on the interim goodwill assessment performed on our Electrophysiology reporting unit during the fourth quarter of 2014, keeping all other variables constant, an increase in the WACC applied of 50 basis points combined with a 100 basis point decrease in the terminal value growth rate would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test. As of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, keeping all other variables constant, an increase in the WACC applied of 100 basis points combined with a 150 basis points decrease in the terminal value growth rate would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our global Neuromodulation reporting unit. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management's best estimates, which we believe to be reasonable, but future declines in business performance may impair the recoverability of our goodwill and intangible asset balances.Legal and Product Liability AccrualsIn the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify. As such, significant judgment 54is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals. Our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us, including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us; trial court or appellate proceedings; and mediation, arbitration or settlement proceedings.Income TaxesWe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note Q - New Accounting Pronouncements to our 2014 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on Standards Implemented and Standards to be Implemented.Additional InformationUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures by Boston ScientificTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income per share. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure that excludes sales from divested businesses is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the accompanying schedules.Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments’ measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.We believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts, such as sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items: 55Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share•Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges - This amount represents (a) non-cash write-downs of certain intangible asset balances during 2014, 2013, and 2012; a non-cash write-down of our goodwill balance attributable to our global Cardiac Rhythm Management reporting unit in the first quarter of 2013; a non-cash write-down of our goodwill balance attributable to our former U.S. Cardiac Rhythm Management reporting unit in the third quarter of 2012; and a non-cash write-down of our goodwill balance attributable to our former EMEA reporting unit in the second quarter of 2012. We remove the impact of non-cash impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, these charges are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity.•Acquisition- and divestiture related net charges (credits) - These adjustments consist of (a) contingent consideration fair value adjustments; (b) gains on previously held equity interests; (c) due diligence, other fees and exit costs; and (d) separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011. The contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments. Due diligence, other fees and exit costs include legal, tax, severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions and divestitures that can be highly variable and not representative of on-going operations. Separation costs and gains on the sale of a business unit primarily represent those associated with the Neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of on-going operations. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Restructuring and restructuring-related charges - These adjustments represent primarily severance and other direct costs associated with our 2014 Restructuring program and 2011 Restructuring program. These costs are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these costs for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Litigation-related charges - These adjustments include certain significant product liability and other litigation-related charges and credits. These amounts are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Discrete tax items - These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions, which were initially established in prior periods in conjuction with the purchase accounting for an acquisition or as a result of intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- or litigation-related charges or credits. These adjustments do not reflect expected on-going operating results. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Debt extinguishment charge - This item represents premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.450 billion of debt during the third quarter of 2013. We believe these are infrequently occuring charges and do not reflect expected on-going results. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.•Amortization expense - Amortization expense is a non-cash expense and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in our credit facility agreement. Management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, amortization expense is excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation. Accordingly, management has excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity. 56Revenue Growth Rates Excluding the Impact of Sales from Divested Businesses and/or Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates•Sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates - Sales from divested businesses are primarily associated with the Neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of on-going operations. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict. Accordingly, management excludes the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance.Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts, such as the sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans by Executive OfficersPeriodically, certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act and our own Stock Trading Policy. A Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amount, prices and dates (or formulas for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including shares issued upon exercise of stock options or vesting of deferred stock units. These plans are entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non-public information about the Company. On November 7, 2014, David A. Pierce, our Senior Vice President and President, Endoscopy, entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan. Mr. Pierce’s plan covers the sale of 17,561 shares of our stock held by him and the sale of shares of our stock to be acquired upon (A) exercise of 50,931 stock options, (B) vesting of deferred stock units representing 23,236 shares (the amount to be sold will be net of shares withheld to satisfy applicable tax withholding obligations upon vesting) and (C) vesting of the 2012 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Units representing 20,701 shares and the 2012 Total Stockholder Return Performance Share Units1 (in each case the amount to be sold will be the total amount of shares issued net of shares withheld to satisfy applicable tax withholding obligations upon vesting). Transactions under Mr. Pierce’s plan are based upon pre-established dates and stock price thresholds. Mr. Pierce’s plan will terminate on the earlier of (among other things) December 31, 2015 and the date all shares subject to the plan have been sold. Any transaction under Mr. Pierce’s plan will be disclosed publicly through appropriate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On November 7, 2014, Karen Prange, our Senior Vice President and President, Urology and Women’s Health, entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan. Ms. Prange’s plan covers the sale of 19,753 shares of our stock held by her and the sale of shares of our stock to be acquired upon vesting of deferred stock units representing 31,685 shares (the amount to be sold will be net of shares withheld to satisfy applicable tax withholding obligations upon vesting). Transactions under Ms. Prange’s plan are based upon pre-established dates and stock price thresholds. Ms. Prange’s plan will terminate on the earlier of (among other things) December 31, 2015 and the date all shares subject to the plan have been sold. Any transaction under Ms. Prange’s plan will be disclosed publicly through appropriate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. On November 19, 2014, Michael P. Phalen, our Executive Vice President and President, MedSurg, entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan. Mr. Phalen’s plan covers the sale of 41,085 shares of our stock held by him and the sale of shares of our stock to be acquired upon (A) exercise of 139,773 stock options, (B) vesting of deferred stock units representing 32,304 shares (the amount to be sold will be net of shares withheld to satisfy applicable tax withholding obligations upon vesting) and (C) vesting of the 2012 Free Cash Flow Performance Share Units representing 41,401 shares and the 2012 Total Stockholder Return Performance Share Units1 (in each case the amount to be sold will be the total amount of shares issued net of shares withheld to satisfy applicable tax withholding obligations upon vesting). Transactions under Mr. Phalen’s plan are based upon pre-established dates and stock price thresholds. Mr. Phalen’s plan will terminate on the earlier of (among other things) December 31, 2015 and the date all shares subject to the plan have been sold. Any transaction under Mr. Phalen’s plan will be disclosed publicly through appropriate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. _____________________1 The number of shares to be awarded to a participant under the Company’s 2012 Total Shareholder Return Performance Share Plan, if any, will be determined by the Executive Compensation and Human Resources Committee of the Board of Directors following December 31, 2014. 57Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingAs the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2014, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ Michael F. Mahoney /s/ Daniel J. Brennan Michael F. Mahoney Daniel J. Brennan President and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and ChiefFinancial Officer 58Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific CorporationWe have audited Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 25, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLPBoston, MassachusettsFebruary 25, 2015 59ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $4.648 billion as of December 31, 2014 and $4.516 billion as of December 31, 2013. We recorded $419 million of other assets and $36 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2014, as compared to $264 million of other assets and $55 million of other liabilities as of December 31, 2013. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $210 million as of December 31, 2014 and $257 million as of December 31, 2013. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $257 million as of December 31, 2014 and by $314 million as of December 31, 2013. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operations.Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of $450 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 to convert fixed-rate debt associated with certain of our senior notes into floating-rate debt. We recorded $25 million of other assets and no amount of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2014. We recorded $1 million of other assets and $8 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2013. A one-percentage point increase in interest rates would have decreased the derivative instruments’ fair value by $35 million as of December 31, 2014 and by $37 million as of December 31, 2013. A one-percentage point decrease in interest rates would have increased the derivative instruments’ fair value by $39 million as of December 31, 2014 and by $41 million as of December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2014, $3.387 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates, representing approximately 80 percent of our total debt.See Note E – Fair Value Measurements to our 2014 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding our derivative financial instruments. 60Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific CorporationWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Boston Scientific Corporation at December 31, 2014 and 2013, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2014, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2014, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 25, 2015 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLPBoston, MassachusettsFebruary 25, 2015 61",2023-12-30 19:42:27.525279

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for further information on our core businesses and products.CardiovascularInterventional CardiologyDrug-Eluting Coronary Stent SystemsOur broad, innovative product offerings have enabled us to become a leader in the interventional cardiology market. This leadership is due in large part to our drug-eluting coronary stent product offerings. Coronary stents are tiny, mesh tubes used in the treatment of coronary artery disease, which are implanted in patients to prop open arteries and facilitate blood flow to and from the heart. We believe we have further enhanced the outcomes associated with the use of coronary stents, particularly the processes that lead to restenosis (the growth of neointimal tissue within an artery after angioplasty and stenting), through product development and scientific research of drug-eluting stent systems. We market the SYNERGY™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System featuring an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating. The SYNERGY Stent is unique in that both its proprietary polymer and everolimus drug coating dissipate by three months. This innovation has the potential to improve post-implant vessel healing and will eliminate long-term polymer exposure, which is a possible cause of late adverse events. In addition, we market the Promus PREMIER™, Promus® Element™ and Promus® Element™ Plus everolimus-eluting stents.Core Coronary TechnologyWe market a broad line of products used to treat patients with atherosclerosis, a principal cause of coronary artery obstructive disease, which is characterized by a thickening of the walls of the coronary arteries and a narrowing of arterial openings caused by the progressive development of deposits of plaque. Our product offerings include balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, crossing and re-entry devices for the treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures. Intravascular Imaging SystemsWe market a family of intravascular catheter-directed ultrasound imaging catheters and systems for use in coronary arteries and heart chambers as well as certain peripheral vessels. Our latest Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging catheter, OptiCross™, has been launched in all major markets worldwide. The iLab® Ultrasound Imaging System continues as our flagship console and is compatible with our full line of imaging catheters. In addition, our new Polaris® software designed to run on the iLab System has 4been approved and launched in the United States (U.S.) and Europe and has been approved in Japan with launch expected in 2016. The iLab System is designed to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of blocked vessels and heart disorders. Further, these systems have been placed in cardiology labs worldwide, which provide an installed base through which we expect to launch new products, including an integrated Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) device for which we have received CE mark and FDA approval and are launching in early 2016. Structural Heart TherapiesStructural heart therapy is one of the fastest growing segments of the medical technology market and is highly synergistic within our Interventional Cardiology business and with our Rhythm Management business. Through the acquisition of Sadra Medical, Inc. (Sadra) in January 2011, we have developed a fully repositionable and retrievable device, the Lotus™ Valve System, for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis. Lotus employs a unique Adaptive Seal™ feature designed to minimize the incidence of paravalvular regurgitation, a predictor of mortality. The Lotus Valve System is CE-marked in the European Union (EU) and in the U.S., it is an investigational device and not available for sale. At the end of 2015, we completed enrollment in our REPRISE III clinical trial and expect FDA approval of the Lotus Valve System in late 2017. We currently have three valve sizes CE marked: 23, 25 and 27mm, and we are developing 21 and 29mm size valves to complete our size matrix. In 2016, we expect to launch our next generation catheter and sheath, Lotus Edge™, in Europe. The benefits of Lotus Edge include a more flexible delivery system, 14 French sheath compatibility and a more simple deployment process. Through the acquisition of Atritech, Inc. (Atritech) in March 2011, we have developed a novel device, the Watchman™ Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Device, designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) who are at risk for ischemic stroke. Watchman has been commercially available internationally since 2009 and is the leading device in percutaneous LAAC globally. In March of 2015, Watchman received FDA approval to treat patients who are at an elevated risk of stroke, deemed suitable for warfarin, and have appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacologic alternative to warfarin. We believe that Watchman will be the only LAAC technology commercially available in the U.S. for multiple years, and in November 2015, we received CE Mark for our next generation device, Watchman FLX™. Watchman FLX is expected to become more widely available to approved EU countries in the first half of 2016. Watchman FLX has a closed distal end, can be fully recaptured and repositioned multiple times and has an expanded LAA treatment range.Peripheral InterventionsWe sell various products designed to treat patients with peripheral disease (disease which appears in blood vessels other than in the heart and in the biliary tree), including a broad line of medical devices used in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and peripheral vascular stenting. Our peripheral product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and vena cava filters.

The addition of Bayer's strong commercial organization and innovative technologies supports our strategy to provide a comprehensive portfolio of leading solutions to treat peripheral vascular disease. The transaction included the leading AngioJet® Thrombectomy System and the Fetch® 2 Aspiration Catheter, which are used in endovascular procedures to remove blood clots from blocked arteries and veins, and the JetStream® Atherectomy System, used in an innovative and fast-growing therapy to remove plaque and thrombi from diseased arteries. We have since launched the AngioJet™ ZelanteDVT™ Thrombectomy Catheter to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in large-diameter upper and lower limb peripheral veins, in the U.S. and Europe. We also sell products designed to treat patients with non-vascular disease (disease that appears outside the blood system). Our non-vascular suite of products includes biliary stents, drainage catheters and micro-puncture sets designed to treat, diagnose and ease various forms of benign and malignant tumors. We market our DirexionTM torqueable microcatheter in both the U.S. and Europe. In addition, we continue to market our extensive line of interventional oncology product solutions, including the recently launched Renegade® HI-FLO™ Fathom® microcatheter and guidewire system and Interlock™ - 35 Fibered IDC™ and 18 Fibered IDC™ Occlusion System for peripheral embolization. 5On December 31, 2015, we acquired the interventional radiology portfolio of CeloNova Biosciences (CeloNova). The acquisition includes drug-eluting microspheres designed to be loaded with chemotherapy drugs for delivery to cancerous tumors, and spherical embolic products used to treat uterine fibroids and other conditions. We believe the CeloNova team and technologies will help advance our position and growth profile within the interventional oncology market. Rhythm Management Cardiac Rhythm ManagementWe develop, manufacture and market a variety of implantable devices that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities, including: •Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) systems used to detect and treat abnormally fast heart rhythms (tachycardia) that could result in sudden cardiac death, including the world's only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardiac defibrillators (S-ICD), along with implantable transvenous cardiac defibrillators and implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems used to treat heart failure; and•Implantable pacemaker systems used to manage slow or irregular heart rhythms (bradycardia), including implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (CRT-P) systems used to treat heart failure.

We offer a full line of stone management products, including ureteral stents, wires, lithotripsy devices, stone retrieval devices, sheaths, balloons and catheters. Within our Pelvic Health business, we market a range of devices for the treatment of conditions such as stress urinary incontinence, pelvic floor reconstruction (rebuilding of the anatomy to its original state), menorrhagia (excessive menstrual bleeding), uterine fibroids and polyps, and erectile dysfunction. We offer a full breadth of mid-urethral sling products, sling materials, graft materials, pelvic floor reconstruction kits, and suturing devices. We market our Genesys Hydro ThermAblator® (HTA) system, an ablation system designed to ablate the endometrial lining of the uterus in premenopausal women with menorrhagia. In the U.S., we have launched the Symphion System™ for the removal of intrauterine fibroids and polyps. In August 2015, we completed the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, which includes men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. The AMS Portfolio Acquisition includes the procurement of leading products for the treatment of a variety of urologic conditions, including the minimally invasive GreenLight XPS™ and HPS™ Laser Therapy Systems for treating BPH, 7the AMS 700™ Inflatable Penile Prosthesis for treating erectile dysfunction, and the AMS 800™ Urinary Control System for treating male stress urinary incontinence. We are in the process of integrating the AMS male urology portfolio into our company. NeuromodulationOur Neuromodulation business offers the PrecisionTM and Precision SpectraTM Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) Systems, used for the management of chronic pain. The Precision SpectraTM System is the world's first and only SCS system with 32 contacts and 32 dedicated power sources and is designed to provide improved pain relief to a wide range of patients who suffer from chronic pain. We believe that we continue to have a technology advantage compared to our competitors with proprietary features such as Multiple Independent Current Control and our Illumina™ 3D proprietary programming software, which together are intended to allow the physician to target specific areas of pain and customize stimulation of nerve fibers more precisely. Additionally, in June 2015, we launched the Precision Novi™ SCS System in Europe. The Precision Novi™ System offers patients and physicians the smallest 16-contact high capacity primary cell (PC), also referred to as non-rechargeable, device for the treatment of chronic pain. We also have CE-mark approval for use of our Vercise™ Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System in Europe for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, tremor and intractable primary and secondary dystonia, a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. In September 2015, we gained CE-mark approvals for the Vercise™ PC DBS System with its Navigator™ programming software. The system allows for programming flexibility to treat a greater range of patients throughout their disease progression. In addition, we received CE Mark approval for the only commercially available Directional Lead powered by current steering. The Directional Lead uses multi-directional stimulation for greater precision, intended to minimize side effects for patients. We are currently in a U.S. pivotal trial with our Vercise DBS System for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. InnovationOur approach to innovation combines internally-developed products and technologies with those we may obtain externally through strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our research and development efforts are focused largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. In addition, we have undertaken strategic acquisitions to help enable us to continue to be a leader in the medical device industry. We expect to continue to invest in our core franchises, and also investigate opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, strategic growth adjacencies and new global markets. During the last several years, we have completed multiple acquisitions to strengthen our core franchises and expand into high growth adjacencies and global markets. There can be no assurance that technologies developed internally or acquired through acquisitions and alliances will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance, and any delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our ability to drive future growth.Research and DevelopmentOur investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth. We expended $876 million on research and development in 2015, $817 million in 2014, and $861 million in 2013. Our investment in research and development reflects the following:•regulatory compliance, clinical science, and internal research and development programs, as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances; and•engineering efforts that incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and next-generation products.We have directed our development efforts toward regulatory compliance and innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets. We are transforming both where and how we conduct research and development and are scrutinizing our cost structure, which we believe will enable increased development activity and faster concept to market timelines. Our approach to new product design and development is through focused, cross-functional teams. We believe that our formal process for technology and product development aids in our ability to offer and manufacture innovative products in a consistent and timely manner. Involvement of the research and development, clinical, quality, regulatory, manufacturing and marketing teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle. We believe this collaboration allows these teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies, and focus on bringing them to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. In addition to internal development, we work with hundreds of leading research institutions, universities and clinicians around the world to develop, evaluate and clinically test our products. We are expanding our collaboration to include global research and development teams in emerging markets; these teams will focus on both global and local market requirements at a lower cost of development. We believe that a large part of our future success will depend upon the strength of these development efforts. 8Marketing and SalesDuring 2015, we marketed our products to approximately 30,000 hospitals, clinics, outpatient facilities and medical offices in the U.S. and across over 115 countries worldwide. The majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations. We also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets, which accounts for our remaining sales. We expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence, use third party distributors. No single institution accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2015 or 2014; however, large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales. We have a dedicated corporate sales organization in the U.S. focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks. We consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers. Each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focused on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions. We believe that this focused disease state management enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with physicians. We believe that we have positive working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry which enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and their patients. International OperationsInternational net sales accounted for approximately 43 percent of our net sales in 2015. Maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Through our international presence, we seek to increase net sales and market share, leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs, accelerate the time to bring new products to market, and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines. In addition, we are investing in infrastructure in emerging markets in order to strengthen our sales capabilities and maximize our opportunities in these countries.As of December 31, 2015, we had six international manufacturing facilities, including three in Ireland, two in Costa Rica and one in Puerto Rico. Approximately 56 percent of our products manufactured in 2015 were produced at these facilities. Additionally, we maintain international research and development capabilities in Ireland, India and China. We operate physician training centers in France, Japan, South Africa, Turkey, and China, and we are currently developing a physician training center in India.Manufacturing and Raw MaterialsWe are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization. We believe by sourcing global manufacturing by technology capabilities, we are able to leverage our existing resources and concentrate on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products. We continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability and service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs, and have substantially increased our focus on process controls and validations, supplier controls, distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify cost-improvement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness.Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. In most cases, the manufacturing of each of our product families is concentrated in one location. We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter. However, significant interruptions in the manufacturing of our products for an extended duration may result in loss of market share, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We also have an on-going program to identify single-source components and to develop alternative back-up supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs. 9In certain cases we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific materials, components or products, largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers. A reduction or interruption in supply, an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required, or a significant increase in the price of raw materials, components or products could adversely affect our operations and financial condition, particularly materials or components related to our CRM products and drug-eluting stent systems. In addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service. We believe we have capabilities sufficient to sterilize our products; however, to the extent we or our third-party sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity, availability of materials for sterilization, regulatory or other constraints, we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizers, sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our operations.Quality AssuranceWe are committed to providing high quality products to our customers. Our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product, component specification process and the manufacturing, sale and servicing of the product. Our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life. These systems are designed to enable us to satisfy the various international quality system regulations, including those of the FDA with respect to products sold in the U.S. All of our manufacturing facilities, and our U.S. and European distribution centers, are certified under the ISO13485 quality system standard, established by the International Standards Organization, for medical devices, which requires, among other items, an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. This certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a company’s quality system by an independent outside auditor. Maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic re-examination.Environmental Regulation and ManagementWe are subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We do not believe that compliance with environmental laws will have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. However, given the scope and nature of these laws, there can be no assurance that environmental laws will not have a material impact on our results of operations. We assess potential environmental contingent liabilities on a regular basis. At present, we are not aware of any such liabilities that would have a material impact on our business.We believe that sound environmental, health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers, stockholders and employees. We are focused on continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution, the depletion of natural resources, and our overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we are working to optimize energy and resource usage, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste. We are certified to the FTSE4Good Corporate Social Responsibility Index, managed by The Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility. This certification recognizes our dedication to those standards, and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policies.We have obtained ISO 14001:2004 certifications at our major manufacturing plants and Tier 1 distribution centers around the world, as well as our Corporate Headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts. ISO 14001:2004 is a globally recognized standard for Environmental Management Systems, established by the International Standards Organization, which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business. Using this environmental management system and the specific attributes of our certified locations in the U.S., Ireland, Costa Rica and the Netherlands, we continue to improve our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprint.CompetitionWe encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products from various companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories; Medtronic plc; St. Jude Medical, Inc.; and Cook Medical; as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, such as pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our products. 10We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers; while also continuing to safely and effectively perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in a less-invasive manner, as well as to provide ease of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current environment of managed care, economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and market sizes. We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to: offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes; create or acquire innovative, scientifically advanced technologies; apply our technology and solutions cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets; develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions; attract and retain skilled personnel; obtain patent or other protection for our products; obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals; continually enhance our quality systems; manufacture and successfully market our products and solutions either directly or through outside parties; and supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demand.Medical Device Regulatory Approvals The medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, based on the risk level of the device. In the U.S., authorization to commercially distribute a new device generally can be met in one of three ways. The first process requires that a premarket notification (510(k)) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device, the “predicate” device. Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.The second process requires the submission of a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices, and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose, and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). For novel technologies, the FDA will generally seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process.The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) be made to the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). An HUD is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects, or is manifested in, fewer than 4,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE is similar in both form and content to a PMA application, but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA. The HUD provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populations.In the European Union, we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives (including the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive) and obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity. It is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable European Medical Devices Directives. We are also required to comply with the regulations of each other country where we commercialize products, such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) and China Food and Drug Administration before we can launch new products in Japan and China, respectively. The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record keeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical 11devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country, or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations.International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent, and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, existing regulations. Certain regulators are requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect that the global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain or maintain future approvals for our products, or could increase the cost and time to obtain or maintain such approvals in the future.Government AffairsWe maintain a global Government Affairs presence, headquartered in Washington, D.C., to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies impacting us, both on a domestic and an international front. The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress and committee staff, the White House and Administration offices, state legislatures and regulatory agencies, and governments overseas on issues affecting our business. Our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal, state and global decision-makers, while also advancing our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions, key priorities and the value of our technologies. The Government Affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in general.Healthcare PoliciesPolitical, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments, and health care delivery structure reforms are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers, and other stakeholders may be significant and new therapies may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption. In addition, the impact to our business of the United States’ Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (ACA) provisions related to coverage expansion, payment reforms, and delivery system changes remains uncertain. In addition, the Federal government, as part of the ACA, and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency, or ""sunshine,"" in relationships between medical device, biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals (HCPs). As a result, we are required by law to report many types of payments and items of value provided to HCPs. Certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws. Failure to comply with sunshine laws and/or implement and adhere to adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations. We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as governments and purchasers implement payment reforms such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, preferential site of service payments, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations (ACOs). We also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing globally as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other groups continue to seek to aggregate purchasing power. Similarly, governments are increasing the use of tenders, placing pressure on medical device pricing. 12In addition, patients and clinicians are becoming more informed on the risks and benefits of alternative treatments as comparative effectiveness research findings are beginning to be disseminated. Therefore, we believe that compelling clinical and economic data will become increasingly important to demonstrate effectiveness and illustrate the economic impacts of technology purchases.See Healthcare Policies within Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for additional information.Third-Party Coverage and ReimbursementOur products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S.), private insurance plans and managed care programs, for the services provided to their patients.Third-party payers and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Reimbursement decisions by payers for these services are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services' assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value. These reimbursement methodologies and decisions confer different, and sometimes conflicting, levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients, and these methodologies and decisions are subject to frequent refinements. Third-party payers are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates, often downwards, indirectly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. There can be no assurance that our products will be covered automatically by third-party payers, that adequate reimbursement will be available or, even if payment is available, that third-party payers' coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably.Proprietary Rights and Patent LitigationWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2015, we held more than 16,000 patents, and had approximately 6,500 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. There can be no assurance that pending patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that patents issued to or licensed by us will not be challenged or circumvented by competitors, or that these patents will be found to be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technology or to provide us with a competitive advantage. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license, except for those relating to our drug-eluting coronary stent systems, is material in relation to our business as a whole.We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and proprietary knowledge.There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Adverse determinations in any patent litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties, and, if licenses are not available, prevent us from manufacturing, selling or using certain of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Patent litigation can be costly and time-consuming, and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the future or that the outcome of litigation will be favorable to us. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties. We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims, and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. See Item 3 and Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of intellectual property, product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved. 13In management’s opinion, we are not currently involved in any legal proceeding other than those specifically identified in Note K, which, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operations and/or cash flows.Risk ManagementWe have an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) program designed to support the achievement of our strategic and organizational objectives, to improve long-term organizational performance and to enhance stockholder value. On an annual basis, we reassess our understanding of the individual risks we face and the steps management is taking to manage those risks using the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) ERM framework. This assessment, which engages key individuals from our Board of Directors and management, ensures alignment and provides increased visibility of the risks we face, and seeks to continually improve the effectiveness of our overall risk management. Current Economic ClimateOur results of operations could be substantially affected by global economic factors and local operating and economic conditions. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products, particularly capital equipment, or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis, if at all. We cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions, including the increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the U.S. and abroad may negatively impact our average selling prices, our net sales and profit margins, procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third-party payers.EmployeesAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately 25,000 employees, including approximately 10,000 in operations; 8,000 in selling, marketing and distribution; 4,000 in clinical, regulatory and research and development; and 3,000 in administration. Of these employees, we employed approximately 12,000 outside the U.S., approximately 7,000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function. We believe that the continued success of our business will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, and we are committed to developing our people and providing them with opportunities to contribute to our growth and success.Community Outreach We are committed to transforming lives and making a positive impact on the communities in which we live and work. We bring this commitment to life by supporting global, national and local health and education initiatives, striving to improve patient advocacy, adhering to strong ethical standards that deliver on our commitments, and minimizing our impact on the environment. A prominent example of our ongoing commitment to educating the next generation of science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) innovators is our growing global network of Boston Scientific STEM Councils. These councils are designed to mobilize employees as volunteers and mentors to share their excitement of learning and working in STEM fields with curious young learners around the world. Our focus on learning and innovation is evidenced by mentoring For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology (FIRST) Robotics teams, visiting classrooms to talk to students about the structure of the heart and STEM careers, along with hosting school groups at our locations for lab tours, tech expos and career panel discussions. In the past year nearly 1,000 employee volunteers dedicated their time and talent to make a positive impact on more than 30,000 children in over 12 communities around the world to increase student aspiration, ability and access to STEM education. Through the Boston Scientific Foundation, established in 2001, we fund non-profit organizations in our local U.S. communities. Community grants focus on increasing access to quality healthcare and improving educational opportunities, particularly related to STEM education.SeasonalityOur worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, customer purchases have historically been lower in the third quarter of the year, as compared to other quarters. This reflects, among other factors, lower demand during summer months in the northern hemisphere, particularly in European countries. 14Available Information Copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), are available free of charge on our website (www.bostonscientific.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the material with or furnish it to the U.S. SEC.

RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements set forth at the end of Item 1 of this Annual Report. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.We face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The medical device markets in which we primarily participate are highly competitive. We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do, including as a result of consolidation among our competitors in the healthcare industry. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories; Medtronic plc; St. Jude Medical, Inc. and Cook Medical, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or which participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, including pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our products.Additionally, the medical device markets in which we primarily participate are characterized by extensive research and development, and rapid technological change. Developments by other companies of new or improved products, processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales. We are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards. If we fail to develop or acquire new products or enhance existing products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a delay in the timing of the launch of next-generation products, and the overall performance of, and continued physician confidence in, those products may result in declines in our market share and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We may experience declines in market size, average selling prices for our products, medical procedure volumes, and our share of the markets in which we compete, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We continue to experience pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity, increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates, economic pressures experienced by our customers, and the impact of managed care organizations and other third-party payers. These and other factors may adversely impact market sizes, as well as our share of the markets in which we compete, the average selling prices for our products or medical procedure volumes. There can be no assurance that the size of the markets in which we compete will increase above existing levels, that we will be able to regain or gain market share or compete effectively on the basis of price or that the number of procedures in which our products are used will increase above existing levels. Decreases in market sizes or our market share and declines in average selling prices or procedural volumes could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to increased demands for price concessions or limit or eliminate our ability to sell to certain of our significant market segments, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payers to curb the rising cost of healthcare have catalyzed a consolidation of aggregate purchasing power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services is expected to continue to intensify, resulting in pricing pressures, decreased average selling prices, and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may increase competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and services and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. 19We are subject to a number of market, business, financial, legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations that could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. International net sales accounted for approximately 43 percent of our global net sales in 2015, with sales from emerging markets accounting for approximately 10 percent. An important part of our growth strategy is to continue pursuing growth opportunities in net sales and market share outside of the U.S. by expanding global presence, including in emerging markets. Our international operations are subject to a number of market, business and financial risks and uncertainties, including those related to political and economic instability; foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations; competitive product offerings; local changes in health care financing and payment systems and health care delivery systems; local product preferences and requirements, including preferences for local manufacturers; workforce instability; less intellectual property protection in certain countries than exists in the United States; and, in certain foreign countries, longer accounts receivable cycles. Such risks and uncertainties may adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy in these markets and, as a result, our sales growth, market share and operating profits from our international operations may be adversely affected. Our international operations are subject to established and developing legal and regulatory requirements for medical devices in each country in which our products are marketed and sold. Most foreign countries have medical device regulations. Further, most countries outside of the U.S. require product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis in order to continue to be marketed and sold there. In addition, several countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, on existing regulations, including requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data. These factors have caused or may cause us to experience more uncertainty, risk, expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions, which could affect our ability to obtain approvals for our products in those jurisdictions and adversely impact our net sales, market share and operating profits from our international operations.Further, international markets are affected by economic pressure to contain healthcare costs, which can lead to lower reimbursement rates for either our products directly or procedures in which are our products are used. Governments and payers may also institute changes in health care delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of health care costs. In addition, certain international markets may also be affected by foreign government efforts to reference reimbursement rates in other countries. All of these types of changes may ultimately reduce selling prices of our products or reduce the number of procedures in which our products are used, which may adversely impact our net sales, market share and operating profits from our international operations.In addition, our international operations are subject to other established and developing U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and/or similar laws in other countries; and U.S. and foreign import and export controls and licensing requirements, trade protection and embargo measures and customs laws. Global businesses, including those in the medical device industry, are facing increasing scrutiny of, and heightened enforcement efforts with respect to, their international operations. Any alleged or actual failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may subject us to government scrutiny, civil and/or criminal proceedings, sanctions and other liabilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our international operations, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity. Any significant changes in the political and economic, financial, competitive, legal and regulatory or reimbursement conditions where we conduct, or plan to expand, our international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Healthcare cost containment pressures, government payment and delivery system reforms, changes in private payer policies, and marketplace consolidations could decrease the demand for our products, the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures performed using our devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the United States) and private health plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental third-party payers is critical to the success of medical technology companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies. Even if we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payers. Further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the United States, Japan, or other countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures, including price regulation, competitive bidding and tendering, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of 20therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Third-party payers for hospital services globally continue to implement policies to contain healthcare costs. The introduction of cost containment incentives, combined with closer scrutiny of healthcare expenditures by both private health insurers and employers, has resulted in increased discounts and contractual adjustments to hospital charges for services performed, led to increased physician employment by hospitals in the U.S. hospital consolidation, and shifted services to the outpatient setting. Initiatives to limit the increase of healthcare costs, including price regulation, are also underway in many countries in which we do business. Hospitals or physicians may respond to these cost-containment pressures by substituting lower cost products or other therapies for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.If we are unable to manage our debt levels, maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies, or experience a disruption in our cash flows it could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing, financial condition or results of operations.As part of our strategy to maximize stockholder value, we use financial leverage to reduce our cost of capital. Our outstanding debt balance was $5.677 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $4.244 billion as of December 31, 2014. Although we currently have investment grade ratings at Moody's Investor Service, Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Fitch Ratings, our inability to maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies could increase our cost of borrowing funds in the future. Delays in our product development and new product launches disruption in our cash flow or our ability to continue to effectively manage our debt levels could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our credit and security facilities contain covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and place other limits on our business. If we are unable to satisfy these covenants, we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all, and we could be required to repay any borrowings on demand.We may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges related to one or more of our global reporting units, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. In the second quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test. We identified our global Electrophysiology reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. As of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, our global Electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 28 percent and held $292 million of allocated goodwill. Also, as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, our global Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 26 percent; however, due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years, no goodwill remains within our CRM reporting unit. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testing.On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or small changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our strategy to realign our business portfolio, we completed several acquisitions in 2015, 2014 and 2013 and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future. Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including corporate restructuring, the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, supply chain, manufacturing, quality systems and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant management time. Some of the factors that could affect the success of our acquisitions include, among others, our ability to execute our business plan for the acquired companies, the strength of the acquired technology, results of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and 21reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures, the continued performance of critical transition services, our ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and retain key employees, and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies, such as increasing sales of our products, achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products. In addition, foreign acquisitions involve unique risks, including those related to integration of operations across different geographies, cultures, and languages; currency risks; and risks associated with the economic, political, legal and regulatory environment in specific countries. Our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business and our future growth. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so, and if our acquisitions are not successful, we may record related asset impairment charges in the future or experience other negative consequences on our results.We may not be successful in our strategy relating to future strategic acquisitions of, investments in, or alliances with, other companies and businesses, which have been a significant source of historical growth for us, and will be key to our diversification into new markets and technologies.Our strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective, high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions, investments and alliances, we may be unable to grow our business. These acquisitions, investments and alliances have been a significant source of our growth. The success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions, investments or alliances will depend on a number of factors, including:•our ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance, if at all;•the ability of our due diligence process to uncover potential issues with target companies;•our ability to finance any future acquisition, investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us, if at all;•whether we are able to complete acquisitions, investments or alliances in a timely manner on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all; •our ability to successfully integrate and operate acquired businesses;•our ability to successfully identify and retain key target employees;•our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including foreign laws and regulations; and•intellectual property and litigation related to newly acquired technologies. Any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing, depending on their size or nature.We may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives; our long-term expense reduction programs may result in an increase in short-term expense; and our efforts may lead to unintended consequences. On an on-going basis we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make investments in research and development projects, capital and our people that we believe are important to our long-term success. As a result of these assessments, from time to time we have undertaken various restructuring and optimization initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. For example, in October 2013, we announced a restructuring initiative (the “2014 Restructuring plan”) intended to build on the progress we have made to address financial pressures in a changing global marketplace, further strengthen our operational effectiveness and efficiency and support new growth investments. Key activities under the 2014 Restructuring plan include continued implementation of our ongoing plant network optimization strategy (aimed at simplifying our manufacturing plant structure, reducing manufacturing costs and improving gross margins); continued focus on driving operational efficiencies; and ongoing business and commercial model changes. Other activities under the plan involve rationalizing organizational reporting structures to streamline various functions, eliminate bureaucracy, increase productivity and better align resources to business strategies and marketplace dynamics. Activities under the plan were initiated in the fourth quarter of 2013 and were substantially completed by the end of 2015. We estimate that the 2014 Restructuring Plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $255 million to $270 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $200 million by the end of 2016. We expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. Expense reduction initiatives under the plan include various cost and efficiency improvement measures, which may include workforce reductions; the transfer of certain production lines and/or the closure of 22certain facilities and other efforts to streamline and better align resources of our business, among other actions. These measures could yield unintended consequences, such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce, inability to attract or retain key personnel, and reduced employee productivity. Attrition beyond any planned reduction in workforce or a material decrease in employee morale or productivity could negatively affect our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, workforce reductions may subject us to the risk of litigation, which could result in substantial cost. Moreover, our restructuring and optimization initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results. We cannot guarantee that the activities under the 2014 Restructuring plan or other restructuring and optimization initiatives that we may undertake in the future will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings.Current domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Uncertainty about global economic conditions, including as a result of credit and sovereign debt issues, has caused and may continue to cause disruption in the financial markets, including diminished liquidity and credit availability. These conditions may adversely affect our suppliers, leading them to experience financial difficulties or to be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products, particularly capital equipment, or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, we have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries. Continued deterioration of the global economy or increase in sovereign debt issues may impact our ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain of those countries in the future. Third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt. This could result in terminations of, or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs. Such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding.The strength and timing of economic recovery remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy. Accordingly, we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions, including sovereign debt issues and increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the U.S. and abroad, may continue to negatively impact our average selling prices, net sales and profit margins, procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payers. In addition, conditions in the financial markets and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our ability to borrow money in the credit markets, access the capital markets and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes.Healthcare policy changes, including healthcare reform legislation, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Political, economic and policy influences are leading the healthcare industry to make substantial structural and financial changes that will continue affecting our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers, and other stakeholders may be significant and may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption. Moreover, there can be no assurance that our strategies will succeed for every product.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 were enacted into law in the U.S. in March 2010. As a U.S. headquartered company with significant sales in the United States, the medical device tax included in this law has materially affected us. The law imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. While the implementation of the medical device tax has been suspended until December 31, 2017, the status of the tax for sales after December 31, 2017 is not clear. The tax may continue to be suspended, or may be reinstated at the same or at a different level. Other provisions of this law, including comparative effectiveness research, pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies and other changes to the payment systems, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for either our products and/or procedures using our products, reduce medical procedure volumes or increase cost containment pressures on us or others in the healthcare sector could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 23We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products. Our products, marketing, sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDC Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval or an exemption from such clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In the European Union, we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives (including the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive) and obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:•take a significant period of time;•require the expenditure of substantial resources;•involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance;•require changes to products; and•result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. In addition, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin or legal manufacturer first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where renewal or recertification applications are required, they may need to be renewed and/or approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements.Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent, and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations. Certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local preclinical and clinical data in addition to global data. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products, or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future. In the European Union, we anticipate a new Medical Device Regulation to be published in 2016, and it is likely to impose additional premarket and postmarket requirements.The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA can take action against a company that promotes ""off-label"" uses. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDC Act and other amending Acts pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products, may limit a company's ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals, and could results in a substantial modification to the company's business practices and operations. International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. 24Regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our business. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our products are continually subject to clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or other third parties, the results of which may be unfavorable, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the FDA's or the market's perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.Our future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and enhancement of existing products, which requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals, all of which may be very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in commercially viable products.In order to develop new products and enhance existing products, we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and businesses. The development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate, and develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and abroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products, and gain and maintain market approval of our products. There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. If we are unable to develop and launch new products and enhanced products, our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted. Further, we are continuing to investigate, and have completed several acquisitions that involve opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into priority growth areas by accessing new products and technologies. There can be no assurance that our investments will be successful or we will be able to access new products and technologies on terms favorable to us, or that these products and technologies will achieve commercial feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of new products and technologies or our decision to reduce our investments may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth.The medical device industry and its customers continue to face scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and are often the subject of numerous investigations, often involving marketing and other business practices or product quality issues including device recalls or advisories. These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings; imposition of substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, including corporate integrity agreements, stipulated judgments or exclusion; diversion of our employees and management's attention; imposition of administrative costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity; and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future. The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities continue to highly scrutinize our industry. We have received, and in the future may receive, subpoenas and other requests for information from Congress and other state and federal governmental agencies, including, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Defense, as well foreign governments and agencies. We have also received, and in the future may receive, subpoenas and other requests for information from comparable international governmental agencies. The requests and/or subpoenas we have received relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance and sale and/or product promotional practices. We have cooperated with these subpoenas and other requests for information, and expect to continue to do so in the future. We cannot predict when a matter will be resolved, the outcome of the matter or its impact on us, and cooperation may involve significant costs, including document production costs. An adverse 25outcome in any matter could include the commencement of an investigation, civil and criminal proceedings; substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs, entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies and amendments to any existing CIAs. In addition, resolution of any matter could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations. For example, in 2009, we entered into a civil settlement with the DOJ regarding the DOJ's investigation relating to certain post-market surveys conducted by Guidant Corporation before we acquired Guidant in 2006. As part of the settlement, we entered into a 5-year CIA with the Office of Inspector General for HHS, which required various provisions, including enhancements to certain compliance procedures related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers. Cooperation with requests and investigations from external agencies result in employee resource costs and diversion of employee focus. If any requests or investigations continue over a long period of time, they could divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operations of our business and impose significant additional administrative burdens on us. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from these requests or investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.In addition, certain foreign governments, state governments (including that of Massachusetts, where we are headquartered) and the U.S. federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers. As an example, compliance with the U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires us by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals at the U.S. federal level made after August 1, 2013. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business. In addition, we have and may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement enhanced structure, policies, systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact our business.We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal cost and exposure to litigation, and have additional adverse effects on our operations.Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity.We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to on-going tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures, including potential tax audit adjustments related to transfer pricing methodology disputes. We have received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and Boston Scientific Corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years. Subsequent to issuing these Notices, the IRS conceded a portion of its original assessment. The total incremental tax liability now asserted by the IRS for the applicable periods is $1.162 billion plus interest. The primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. In addition, the IRS has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our Transaction Agreement with Abbott Laboratories (Abbott) pertaining to the sale of Guidant's vascular intervention business to Abbott in April 2006. We do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the IRS or its resulting assessment, and we believe that the IRS has exceeded its authority by attempting to adjust the terms of our negotiated third-party agreement with Abbott. In addition, we believe that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations.We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings, and we have filed, or will timely file, petitions with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the Notices of Deficiency for the tax years in challenge. No payments on the net assessment would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. The IRS has completed its examination of the 2008 through 2010 tax years of Boston Scientific and has proposed significant adjustments to our tax returns for these tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that are currently being contested in U.S. Tax Court for our tax years prior to 2008. As with the prior years, we disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the IRS, and we expect to contest any adjustments received through applicable IRS and judicial procedures, as appropriate. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. However, final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations.There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves, and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Additionally, changes in tax laws or tax rulings could materially impact our effective tax rate. For example, impacts due to implementation related to 26base erosion and profit shifting and/or proposals for fundamental U.S. corporate tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our future results of operations.We may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Physician customers have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However, intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable and appellate courts can overturn lower court decisions. Furthermore, as our business increasingly relies on technology systems and infrastructure, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation.Competing parties in our industry frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies.Several third parties have asserted that our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. We have similarly asserted that products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us. Adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Patents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business, and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others. We currently own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending. We also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash, cross-licensing rights or royalty payments. No assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that any current or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors, or that our patents will not be found invalid. In addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade secrets or know-how or to assert them against claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful. We are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual property-related actions. The invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own, or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.In addition, the laws of certain countries in which we market, and plan on manufacturing some of our products in the near future, do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Furthermore, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access, and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other data, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber-attacks or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations. 27Pending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.We operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and, in recent years, it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies. We are currently the subject of various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under Note K- Commitments and Contingencies to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy, and its outcome is difficult to predict. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial condition, results of operation or liquidity. Pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel. In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged, we may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us, if at all. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Pending and future product liability claims and other litigation, including private securities litigation, stockholder derivative suits and contract litigation, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or liquidity.The design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. Many of the medical devices that we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell, including physician technique and experience in performing the surgical procedure, component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects, off-label use or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could result in product liability claims, a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.We are currently the subject of product liability litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under Note K- Commitments and Contingencies to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, including not only actual damages, but also punitive damages. The magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in the future, regardless of the outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Additionally, we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims, and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The fact that we do not maintain third-party insurance coverage for all categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions, and these losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Any failure to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a medical device manufacturer, we are required to register our establishments and list our devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its Quality System Regulation requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the Federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA which may result in observations on Form 483, and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain International Standards Organization (ISO) certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. Many other countries in which we do business have requirements similar to those of the US or the EU, and other foreign governments or agencies may subject us to periodic inspections as well. If we, or our manufacturers, fail to adhere to quality system regulations or ISO requirements, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 28Interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. In most cases, the manufacturing of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. Factors such as a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand. In the event of a significant interruption, for example, as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to needs for regulatory approvals. As a result, we may experience loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture, and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by third-party vendors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from third-party vendors. Certain of these materials and components are purchased from single sources due to quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors' manufacturing processes. A reduction or interruption in the supply of materials and components used in manufacturing our products; an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale, and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service. To the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity, availability of materials for sterilization, regulatory or other constraints, we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizer, sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.We rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and changing customer patterns. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients with our products or our proprietary information. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. Any of these events, in turn, may cause us to lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, be subject to legal claims and liability, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our share price has been volatile and may fluctuate, and accordingly, the value of an investment in our common stock may also fluctuate.Stock markets in general, and our common stock in particular, have experienced significant price and volume volatility over recent years. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due to factors described under this Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors,” as well as economic and geopolitical conditions general, and also to variability in the prevailing sentiment regarding our operations or business prospects, as well as, among other things, changing investment priorities of our stockholders. Because the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able sell their shares at attractive prices. 29If we are unable to attract or retain key personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations. In our industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate, and we may face increased competition for such employees, particularly in emerging markets as the trend toward globalization continues. Our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key personnel, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining and developing existing personnel or recruiting new personnel. The loss of one or more key employees, our ability to attract or develop additional qualified employees or any delay in hiring key personnel could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 30ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTSNone.ITEM 2. PROPERTIESOur world headquarters is located in Marlborough, Massachusetts, with additional support provided from regional headquarters located in Singapore and Voisins-le-Bretonneux, France. As of December 31, 2015, our principal manufacturing and technology centers were located in Minnesota, California, and Indiana within the U.S.; as well as internationally in Ireland, Costa Rica and Puerto Rico. Our products are distributed worldwide from customer fulfillment centers in Massachusetts, the Netherlands and Japan. As of December 31, 2015, we maintained 13 principal manufacturing facilities, including seven in the U.S., three in Ireland, two in Costa Rica, and one in Puerto Rico, as well as various distribution and technology centers around the world. Many of these facilities produce and manufacture products for more than one of our divisions and include research facilities.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Executive Summary AMS Portfolio AcquisitionOn August 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the American Medical Systems male urology portfolio (AMS Portfolio Acquisition), which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. Total consideration was comprised of $1.616 billion in up-front cash plus related fees and expenses, and a potential additional $50 million in consideration based on 2016 sales. The AMS male urology portfolio is being integrated with our formerly named Urology and Women's Health business, and the joint businesses have become Urology and Pelvic Health.Financial Highlights and TrendsIn 2015, we generated net sales of $7.477 billion, as compared to $7.380 billion in 2014, an increase of $97 million, or one percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $505 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2015, as compared to 2014. We had no sales related to our divested Neurovascular business in 2015, compared to a reported $4 million in the prior year. Refer to Note C - Divestitures included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on the Neurovascular divestiture. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $606 million, or eight percent, as compared to the prior year. This increase included net sales of approximately $240 million in 2015, but with no prior period related net sales, due to the acquisition of the Interventional Division of Bayer AG (Bayer) and the AMS Portfolio Acquisition.1 Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our sales results.Our reported net loss in 2015 was $239 million, or $0.18 per share. Our reported results for 2015 included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges; restructuring- and restructuring-related charges; litigation-related charges; pension termination charges; debt extinguishment charges; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $1.506 billion, or $1.11 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2015 was $1.267 billion, or $0.93 per share1.Our reported net loss in 2014 was $119 million, or $0.09 per share. Our reported results for 2014 included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits; restructuring- and restructuring-related charges; litigation-related charges; discrete tax items; and amortization expense (after-tax) of $1.248 billion, or $0.93 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2014 was $1.129 billion, or $0.84 per share1. The following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP) to those adjusted results considered by management.

The decrease was due to litigation-related payments made during 2015. Our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth, including acquisitions and strategic alliances, managing our contingencies and reducing our debt levels.As of December 31, 2015, we had total debt of $5.677 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $319 million and working capital of $1.041 billion. We hold investment-grade ratings with all three major credit-rating agencies. We believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy.Business and Market OverviewCardiovascularInterventional Cardiology Our Interventional Cardiology division develops, manufactures and markets technologies for diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders. Product offerings include coronary stents, including drug-eluting and bare metal stent systems, balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, crossing and re-entry devices for the treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels, diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty procedures, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging systems. We also offer structural heart products in certain markets, which include a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and a device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation that are at risk for ischemic stroke.Our worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products were $2.033 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 27 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products decreased $24 million, or one percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $174 million negative impact on our Interventional Cardiology net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $150 million, or seven percent. The year-over-year increase in our worldwide Interventional Cardiology net sales was primarily related to sales of our WATCHMAN® device following the U.S. commercial launch during the first quarter of 2015 and our Lotus™ Valve System in Europe; along with operational growth in our other cardiology product lines, including our OptiCross™ Coronary Imaging Catheter; our iLab® Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging System and our Polaris® Imaging System; drug-eluting stents and our AngioJet™ Thrombectomy product offerings. 36Worldwide sales from our drug-eluting coronary stents were $1.074 billion during 2015, as compared to $1.151 billion during 2014, representing a significant portion of our Interventional Cardiology net sales. Our drug-eluting stent systems include our next generation SYNERGY™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System and our Promus PREMIER™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System, both of which are designed to provide physicians with improved drug-eluting stent performance in treating patients with coronary artery disease. SYNERGY™ features an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating, while PREMIER™ features a unique customized platinum chromium alloy stent architecture and an enhanced stent delivery system. We received FDA approval of the SYNERGY™ technology and Japanese regulatory approval in the fourth quarter of 2015.Our structural heart product offerings include our Lotus™ Valve System, a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and our WATCHMAN® device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. The Lotus™ Valve System consists of a stent-mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve. In October 2013, we received CE mark approval and launched the Lotus™ Valve System in Europe. In December 2015, full trial enrollment was completed in the REPRISE III clinical trial, which is required to support FDA premarket approval for the Lotus™ Valve System. The WATCHMAN® Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology (WATCHMAN®) is the first device studied in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to warfarin, and is marketed in CE-mark countries and other international countries, as well as the U.S. following FDA approval in March 2015.Peripheral InterventionsOur Peripheral Interventions (PI) product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and other devices used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease, along with certain products to diagnose and ease various forms of cancer.Our worldwide net sales of PI products were $904 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of PI products increased $54 million, or six percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $60 million negative impact on our worldwide PI net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $114 million, or 13 percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide PI net sales was primarily driven by revenues from acquired Bayer products, as well as growth in our core PI franchises, our stent franchise following FDA approval and launch of our Innova™ Vascular self-expanding stent system in the U.S., our interventional oncology franchise and our drug-eluting product franchise.On December 31, 2015, we acquired the interventional radiology portfolio of CeloNova Biosciences (CeloNova). The acquisition includes drug-eluting microspheres designed to be loaded with chemotherapy drugs for delivery to cancerous tumors, and spherical embolic products used to treat uterine fibroids and other conditions. We believe the CeloNova team and technologies will help advance our position and growth profile within the interventional oncology market. On August 29, 2014, we completed the acquisition of the Interventional Division of Bayer for $414 million in cash. We believe that this acquisition enhances our ability to offer physicians and healthcare systems a more complete portfolio of solutions to treat challenging vascular conditions. The addition of Bayer's strong commercial organization and innovative technologies supports our strategy to provide a comprehensive portfolio of leading solutions to treat peripheral vascular disease. The transaction includes the leading AngioJet® Thrombectomy System and the Fetch® 2 Aspiration Catheter, which are used in endovascular procedures to remove blood clots from blocked arteries and veins, and the JetStream® Atherectomy System, used in an innovative and fast-growing therapy to remove plaque and thrombi from diseased arteries.Rhythm ManagementCardiac Rhythm ManagementOur Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) business develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices including implantable cardioverter defibrillator systems and implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, including the world's first and only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator, the S-ICD® System, and pacemaker systems that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities. Our worldwide net sales of CRM products were $1.807 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 24 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of CRM products decreased $105 million, or five percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $117 million negative impact on our CRM net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $12 million, or one percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide CRM net sales was primarily driven by growth in our S-ICD® 37net sales following the launch of our next-generation Emblem S-ICD® system in Europe and the U.S. during the second and third quarters of 2015, as well as growth in our international CRM business as we increase market share following recent product launches, partially offset by lower volumes of replacement procedures for our defibrillators due to their longevity and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) sales declines in certain regions due to competitive technology offerings. In addition, our global pacemaker revenue increased on a constant currency basis during 2015, as compared to 2014. This increase was primarily driven by the continued adoption of the ACCOLADE™ family of pacemakers and cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers, and the Ingevity™ MRI pacing lead.The following are the U.S. and international components of our worldwide CRM net sales: Year Ended Year Ended(in millions) December 31, 2015 December 31, 2014 U.S. International Total U.S. International TotalDefibrillator systems $858 $455 $1,313 $867 $513 $1,380Pacemaker systems 239 255 494 255 277 532CRM products $1,097 $710 $1,807 $1,122 $790 $1,912ElectrophysiologyOur Electrophysiology business develops less-invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart. Our leading products include the Blazer™ line of ablation catheters, designed to deliver enhanced performance and responsiveness, and the Rhythmia™ Mapping System, a next-generation, catheter-based, 3-D cardiac mapping and navigation solution designed to help diagnose and treat a variety of arrhythmias. Our worldwide net sales of Electrophysiology products were $233 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately three percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Electrophysiology products increased $6 million, or two percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $14 million negative impact on our Electrophysiology net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $20 million, or nine percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide Electrophysiology net sales was primarily due to increased sales of our Rhythmia™ Mapping System and EP capital products.MedSurgEndoscopyOur Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. Our worldwide net sales of Endoscopy products were $1.306 billion for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately 18 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Endoscopy products decreased $17 million, or one percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $96 million impact on our Endoscopy net sales in 2015 as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $79 million, or six percent. The year-over-year increase in worldwide Endoscopy net sales was primarily driven by growth across several of our key product franchises, including our biliary device franchise with the launch of the SpyGlass™ DS Direct Visualization System and our AXIOS™ Stent and Electrocautery-Enhanced Delivery System for endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural drainage of pancreatic pseudo cysts; our metal stent franchise driven by our Biliary WallFlex® product family; and our biopsy and polypectomy franchises, featuring our industry leading products such as forceps and snares. In April 2015, we acquired Xlumena, Inc. (Xlumena), which developed minimally invasive devices for Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) guided transluminal drainage of targeted areas within the gastrointestinal tract, including the AXIOS™ Stent.Urology and Pelvic HealthOur Urology and Pelvic Health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and pelvic conditions. Our worldwide net sales of Urology and Pelvic Health products were $693 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately nine percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Urology and Pelvic Health products increased $158 million, or 30 percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $35 million impact on our Urology and Pelvic Health net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $193 million, or 36 percent. The year -over-year increase 38in worldwide Urology and Pelvic Health net sales was primarily attributable to revenue of approximately $158 million related to the AMS Portfolio Acquisition along with growth across all of our other global franchises.In August 2015, we completed the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. The AMS Portfolio Acquisition includes the procurement of leading products for the treatment of a variety of urologic conditions, including the minimally invasive GreenLight XPS™ and HPS™ Laser Therapy Systems for treating BPH, the AMS 700™ Inflatable Penile Prosthesis for treating erectile dysfunction, and the AMS 800™ Urinary Control System for treating male stress urinary incontinence. In May 2014, we completed the acquisition of the remaining fully diluted equity of IoGyn, Inc. (IoGyn). IoGyn has developed the Symphion™ System, a next generation system for hysteroscopic intrauterine tissue removal including fibroids (myomas) and polyps. In March 2014, IoGyn received U.S. FDA approval for the system and in October 2014, we launched the system in the U.S. NeuromodulationOur Neuromodulation business offers the Precision® and Precision Spectra™ Spinal Cord Stimulator systems and, in Europe, the Precision Novi™ SCS System, used for the management of chronic pain; and our Vercise™ Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System in Europe for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, tremor and intractable primary and secondary dystonia, a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products were $501 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, or approximately seven percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products increased $29 million, or six percent, in 2015, as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $9 million impact on our Neuromodulation net sales in 2015, as compared to 2014, net sales of these products increased $38 million, or eight percent. The year-over-year increase in our worldwide Neuromodulation net sales was primarily driven by share gains from our CoverEdge™ 32-contact Paddle Lead and continued adoption of the Precision Spectra™ Spinal Cord Stimulator System in the U.S. and increased net sales in Europe driven by our Vercise™ DBS System and sales of the recently launched non-rechargeable Precision Novi™ SCS System.Emerging MarketsAs part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, described in Item 1 of this Annual Report, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in Emerging Markets. We define Emerging Markets as including 20 developing countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors, and our global capabilities. We are seeking to expand our presence and strengthen relationships in order to grow net sales and market share within our Emerging Markets, and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities. Our Emerging Markets revenue grew two percent, as compared to the prior year, and was approximately 10 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2015. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative impact of 11 percent, net sales in these markets grew 13 percent.Litigation ChargesWe recorded net litigation-related charges in the amount of $1.105 billion in 2015, $1.036 billion in 2014, and $221 million in 2013. See Results of Operations below and Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.Neurovascular DivestitureIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.500 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion during 2011, $10 million during 2012, $30 million during 2013 and the final amount due to us in 2014. After the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker, we provided transitional services through a transition services agreement, and also manufactured and supplied products to Stryker through a supply agreement. These transition services and supply agreements substantially ended during 2013. Our sales related to our divested Neurovascular business have ceased as the various transition services and supply agreements have terminated. Due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the Neurovascular business, the divestiture does not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. See Results of Operations below and Note C - Divestitures to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information. 39Restructuring InitiativesOn an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and we assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital, our people and other programs that we believe are important to drive our growth. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. We had one active restructuring program during 2015, our 2014 Restructuring Plan, which was approved by our Board of Directors on October 22, 2013. We substantially completed the activities under the plan during 2015, with the exception of certain actions associated with our plant network optimization strategy, which we expect to be complete by the end of 2016. Additional information can be found in Results of Operations below and Note H – Restructuring-related Activities to our 2015 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Healthcare PoliciesPolitical, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments, and health care delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers, and other stakeholders may be significant and new therapies may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. The legislation imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. We recorded $78 million in 2015, $72 million in 2014 and $73 million in 2013, within our selling, general and administrative expenses. In December 2015, the Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act, or PATH Act, was passed, which included legislation which temporarily suspended the 2.3 percent excise tax until December 31, 2017. The status of the tax for sales after December 31, 2017 is not clear. We intend to reinvest the amounts we would have expended on this tax into jobs, innovation, research and development, collaborations with universities, and other initiatives that will help treat patients and drive revenue growth.We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, preferential site of service payments, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations (ACOs) continue to take shape globally. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan and Europe and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products, which in turn may influence a hospital’s or physician's selection of products used to treat patients.Any changes in government policies that lower reimbursement for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes in countries in which we conduct business could adversely affect our business and results of operations. We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally.Results of OperationsNet SalesWe manage our global businesses on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. Management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using standard internal currency exchange rates held constant for each year. The following table provides our worldwide net sales by global business and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. Net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and net sales from divested businesses are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or 40as a replacement for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Refer to Additional Information of this Item 7 for a further discussion of management’s use of this non-GAAP financial measure. 2015 versus 2014 2014 versus 2013 Year EndedDecember 31, As ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasis As ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasis(in millions)201520142013 Interventional Cardiology$2,033$2,057$1,997 (1)%7% 3 %5 %Peripheral Interventions904850809 6 %13% 5 %7 %Cardiovascular2,9372,9072,806 1 %9% 4 %5 % Cardiac Rhythm Management1,8071,9121,886 (5)%1% 1 %2 %Electrophysiology233227155 2 %9% 47 %48 %Rhythm Management2,0402,1392,041 (5)%1% 5 %6 % Endoscopy1,3061,3231,280 (1)%6% 3 %5 %Urology and Pelvic Health693535505 30 %36% 6 %7 %Neuromodulation501472453 6 %8% 4 %5 %MedSurg2,5002,3302,238 7 %13% 4 %5 % Subtotal Core Businesses7,4777,3767,085 1 %8% 4 %6 %Divested Businesses—458 N/AN/A (91)%(91)%Worldwide$7,477$7,380$7,143 1 %8% 3 %5 %The constant currency growth rates in the table above can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note O - Segment Reporting to our 2015 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Growth rates are based on actual, non-rounded amounts and may not recalculate precisely. Refer to Executive Summary for further discussion of our net sales and a comparison of our 2015 and 2014 net sales.In 2014, we generated net sales of $7.380 billion, as compared to $7.143 billion in 2013, an increase of $237 million, or three percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $99 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2014 as compared to 2013 and sales related to our divested Neurovascular business declined $54 million in 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $390 million, or six percent, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to constant currency increases in net sales from our Interventional Cardiology business of $97 million; from our Electrophysiology business of $74 million, primarily due to our acquisition of the electrophysiology business of C.R. Bard Inc. in November 2013; from our Endoscopy business of $66 million, and from our Peripheral Interventions business of $56 million. 41Gross ProfitOur gross profit was $5.304 billion in 2015, $5.170 billion in 2014, and $4.969 billion in 2013. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased to 70.9 percent in 2015, as compared to 70.1 percent in 2014 and 69.6 percent in 2013. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period: Year EndedDecember 31, 20152014Gross profit - prior year70.1 %69.6 %Manufacturing cost reductions1.8 %1.8 %Neurovascular divestiture— %0.4 %Sales pricing and mix(0.6)%(1.5)%Inventory step-up due to acquisition accounting(0.4)%(0.1)%Net impact of foreign currency0.5 %0.2 %All other, including other inventory charges and other period expense(0.5)%(0.3)%Gross profit - current year70.9 %70.1 %The increase in our gross profit margin for 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs. Partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of pricing declines related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products. In addition, in connection with the accounting for the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, we adjusted acquired inventory from manufacturing cost to fair value. The step-up in value is amortized through gross profit over an average estimated inventory turnover period. In 2015, we recorded increased cost of $36 million associated with the step-up.The increase in our gross profit margin for 2014, as compared to 2013, primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs, as well as the positive impacts of lower sales related to our divested businesses, as these sales were at significantly lower gross profit margins. Partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of pricing declines related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products and changes in the mix of our product sales. Operating ExpensesThe following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 % of Net % of Net % of Net(in millions) $Sales $Sales $SalesSelling, general and administrative expenses 2,87338.4% 2,90239.3% 2,67437.4%Research and development expenses 87611.7% 81711.1% 86112.0%Royalty expense 700.9% 1111.5% 1402.0%Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) ExpensesIn 2015, our SG&A expenses decreased $29 million, or one percent, as compared to 2014, and were 90 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. This decrease was driven by the impacts of our foreign currency fluctuations and declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives.In 2014, our SG&A expenses increased $228 million, or nine percent, as compared to 2013, and were 190 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. This increase was driven primarily by SG&A increases related to business combinations that we have completed over the last several years, product launches and other commercial and corporate programs, variable employee-related benefits and our expansion efforts in emerging markets, partially offset by declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives. 42Research and Development (R&D) ExpensesWe remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses. In 2015, our R&D expenses increased $59 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2014, and were 60 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. The increase was due primarily to investments across all of our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth and increased cost related to recent acquisitions and alliances, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations.In 2014, our R&D expenses decreased $44 million, or approximately five percent, as compared to 2013, and were 90 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease was due primarily to the benefits from our initiatives to transform our research and development efforts to be more effective and cost efficient, as well as the timing of certain R&D programs. Royalty ExpenseIn 2015, our royalty expense decreased $41 million, or 37 percent, as compared to 2014, and was 60 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to the renegotiation of a royalty agreement in the second quarter of 2014 that resulted in a lower royalty rate structure.In 2014, our royalty expense decreased $29 million, or 21 percent, as compared to 2013, and was 50 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to the renegotiation of a royalty agreement in the second quarter of 2014 that resulted in a lower royalty rate structure.Amortization ExpenseOur amortization expense was $495 million in 2015, as compared to $438 million in 2014, an increase of $57 million or 13 percent. This increase was due primarily to amortizable intangible assets acquired in the AMS Portfolio Acquisition.Amortization expense was $438 million in 2014, as compared to $410 million in 2013, an increase of $28 million or seven percent. This increase was due primarily to amortizable intangible assets acquired during the fourth quarter of 2013 and during 2014.Amortization expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Goodwill & Intangible Asset Impairment ChargesWe have recorded intangible asset impairment charges, including impairments of in-process research and development, of $19 million in 2015, $195 million in 2014 and $53 million in 2013.In 2013, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $423 million following our reorganization from geographic regions to global business units on January 1, 2013. No goodwill impairment charges were recorded in 2015 and 2014.See Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional details related to our goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges.Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates for a discussion of key assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. Goodwill impairment charges and intangible asset impairment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Contingent Consideration ExpenseWe recorded a net expense related to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities of $123 million in 2015, a net benefit of $85 million in 2014 and a net expense of $4 million in 2013. See Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our contingent consideration expense associated with our acquisitions. Contingent consideration expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.Restructuring-related Activities and ChargesWe recorded restructuring charges pursuant to our restructuring plan of $26 million during 2015, $69 million during 2014, and $101 million during 2013. In addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of our accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $57 million during 2015, $48 million during 2014, and $23 million 43during 2013. Restructuring and restructuring-related costs are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.2014 Restructuring PlanAs of December 31, 2015, we have recorded total costs of $229 million under the 2014 Restructuring Plan, of which $125 million has been recorded as restructuring charges and the remaining portion has been recorded through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. We estimate that the 2014 Restructuring Plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $255 million to $270 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $200 million by the end of 2016. We expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. Other Restructuring PlansOur other restructuring plans, including our 2011 Restructuring Plan and our prior year Plant Network Optimization Program were substantially completed by the end of 2013.We made cash payments of $95 million in 2015, $112 million in 2014, and $141 million in 2013 associated with our restructuring initiatives. See Note H - Restructuring-related Activities to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our restructuring plans and activities.Litigation-related Charges and CreditsWe recorded net litigation-related charges in the amount of $1.105 billion in 2015, $1.036 billion in 2014, and $221 million in 2013. The net charges recorded in 2015 include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims, the Mirowski lawsuit and certain other items. The net charges recorded in 2014 include a $600 million charge related to the agreement between our subsidiary, Guidant Corporation (Guidant) and Johnson & Johnson signed on February 13, 2015, to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by Johnson & Johnson, stemming from our acquisition of Guidant. In exchange, we made aggregate payments totaling $600 million to Johnson & Johnson during 2015. The 2014 net charges also include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims and certain other items. These charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants. See Note K - Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional discussion of our litigation-related matters.Pension Termination Charges We recorded pension termination charges of $44 million during 2015, which are associated with the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan, a frozen defined benefit plan. No pension termination charges were recorded during 2014 and 2013. We do not expect to incur any additional charges in the future related to the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan. The pension termination charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.Gain on DivestitureIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $12 million during 2014 and a gain of $38 million during 2013 associated with the transaction. These divestiture-related gains are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Interest ExpenseOur interest expense increased to $284 million in 2015, as compared to $216 million in 2014. The increase was primarily due to incremental debt to finance the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, offset by savings from the re-financing of our senior notes, along with a pre-tax charge of approximately $45 million associated with debt extinguishment charges, representing premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.000 billion of debt during the second quarter of 2015. Debt extinguishment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Our average borrowing rate was 5.2 percent in 2015, including the impact of debt extinguishment charges, and 4.8 percent in 2014. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note F – Borrowings and Credit 44Arrangements to our 2015 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations.Our interest expense decreased to $216 million in 2014, as compared to $324 million in 2013. The decrease was primarily due to $70 million of debt extinguishment charges, representing premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of accelerated amortization of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.450 billion of debt during the third quarter of 2013. Our average borrowing rate was 4.8 percent in 2014, as compared to 6.9 percent in 2013, which includes the impact of the debt extinguishment charges.Other, netOur other, net reflected expense of $39 million in 2015, income of $8 million in 2014, and expense of $19 million in 2013. The following are the components of other, net: Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201520142013Interest income $5$5$6Foreign currency losses (21)(18)(11)Net gains (losses) on investments (9)27(9)Other expense, net (14)(6)(5) $(39)$8$(19)During 2015, we recognized net losses on investments of $9 million due to equity method adjustments on investments and investment impairments. During 2014, we recognized gains of $19 million associated with the acquisition of IoGyn, Inc. related to previously held investments and other net gains related to our investment portfolio of $8 million. During 2013, we recognized losses on investments of $9 million due to equity method adjustments on investments and investment impairments. The acquisition-related gains from previously held investments are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Tax RateThe following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Year EndedDecember 31, 201520142013Reported tax rate 63.2 %76.7 %46.0 %Impact of certain receipts/charges* (53.5)%(64.5)%(35.4)% 9.7 %12.2 %10.6 %*These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.The change in our reported tax rate for 2015, as compared to 2014 and 2013, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.In 2015, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related items, litigation- and restructuring-related items, pension termination charges, and debt extinguishment charges. Our reported tax rate for 2015 was also affected by discrete items primarily related to settlement of various uncertain tax positions and reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied. In 2014, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net credits, and litigation- and restructuring-related charges. Our reported tax rate for 2014 was also affected by discrete tax items primarily related to resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to change in uncertain tax positions due to a favorable court ruling, offset by a charge due to translation gain on previously taxed income. In 2013, these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges, litigation- and restructuring-related charges, and debt extinguishment charges. Our reported tax rate for 2013 was also affected by discrete tax items related primarily to the resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration 45of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied. Excluding the impact of these receipts and charges in 2015, 2014 and 2013, the change in our reported tax rate between years is primarily the result of shifts in the geographic mix of our business and in 2015, the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. We have received Notices of Deficiency from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for its 2001 through 2006 tax years and Boston Scientific Corporation for its 2006 and 2007 tax years. The total incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS for the applicable periods is $1.162 billion plus interest. The primary issue in dispute for all years is the transfer pricing associated with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. In addition, the IRS has proposed adjustments in connection with the financial terms of our Transaction Agreement with Abbott Laboratories pertaining to the sale of Guidant's vascular intervention business to Abbott in April 2006. In addition to the Notices of Deficiency, during 2014, we received a Revenue Agent Report from the IRS reflecting significant proposed audit adjustments to our 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years based upon the same transfer pricing methodologies that the IRS applied to our 2001 through 2007 tax years.We do not agree with the transfer pricing methodologies applied by the IRS or its resulting assessment. In addition, we believe that the IRS positions with regard to these matters are inconsistent with the applicable tax laws and the existing Treasury regulations. We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings, and we have filed petitions with the U.S. Tax Court contesting the Notices of Deficiency for the 2001 - 2007 tax years in challenge. We currently expect the trial in this matter to begin in the second half of 2016. Furthermore, we have submitted a letter to the IRS protesting the Revenue Agent Report for the 2008 - 2010 tax years and requesting an administrative appeal hearing. We do not believe that the IRS will hear our appeal until the Tax Court case is concluded.No payments on the net assessments would be required until the dispute is definitively resolved, which, based on experiences of other companies, could take several years. We believe our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate as of December 31, 2015. However, final resolution is uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. See Note J - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our tax rate and our tax court disputes.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesBased on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, fund possible mergers and/or acquisitions and service and repay our existing debt.As of December 31, 2015, we had $319 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $118 million invested in money market and government funds and $201 million in short-term time deposits and interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We also have full access to our $2.000 billion revolving credit facility and $300 million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables, both described below.The following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013: Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201520142013Cash provided by operating activities $600$1,269$1,110Cash used for investing activities (2,186)(745)(475)Cash provided by (used for) financing activities 1,322(150)(624) 46Operating ActivitiesDuring 2015, we generated $600 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $1.269 billion in 2014, a decrease of $669 million or 53 percent. This decrease was primarily due to $600 million of payments to Johnson & Johnson as a result of the settlement agreement signed on February 13, 2015 to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by Johnson & Johnson against Guidant, stemming from our acquisition of Guidant in 2006. As a result of the settlement agreement, Johnson & Johnson agreed to dismiss permanently its action without acknowledgment of liability by Guidant. In exchange, we made aggregate payments totaling $600 million to Johnson & Johnson.During 2014, we generated $1.269 billion of cash from operating activities, as compared to $1.110 billion in 2013, an increase of $159 million, or 14 percent. This increase was primarily due to reductions in our accounts receivable due to a government funded settlement of outstanding receivables in Spain during 2014 and lower payments related to interest and costs associated with debt extinguishment; partially offset by increases in our inventory levels and higher payments related to contingent consideration.Investing ActivitiesDuring 2015, cash used for investing activities was $2.186 billion. Our investing activities included $1.734 billion of payments, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions, including the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, CeloNova and Xlumena; along with $266 million of payments related to strategic investments, including equity investments in Preventice, Inc. and Frankenman Medical Equipment Company. Cash used for investing activities also included purchases of property, plant and equipment of $247 million. We intend to invest approximately $350 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment during 2016.During 2014, cash used for investing activities was $745 million. Our investing activities included $486 million of payments for the acquisitions of IoGyn and the Interventional Division of Bayer, net of cash acquired. Cash used for investing activities also included purchases of property, plant and equipment of capital expenditures of $259 million.During 2013, cash used for investing activities was $475 million. Our investing activities included capital expenditures of $245 million and a $274 million payment for the acquisition of C.R. Bard's electrophysiology business. These expenditures were partially offset by $53 million of proceeds received from the sale of our Natick, Massachusetts headquarters in 2013. Financing ActivitiesOur cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs and repurchases of common stock pursuant to our authorized repurchase programs, discussed in Note L - Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, our financing activities included $156 million of contingent payments in 2015, $34 million of payments in 2014 and $160 million of payments in 2013 associated with our previous acquisitions.Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic conditions, adverse litigation outcomes and other risk and uncertainties could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and adversely affect our liquidity plans. DebtWe had total debt of $5.677 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $4.244 billion as of December 31, 2014 which consisted of the following:Credit FacilitiesIn April 2015, we entered into a new $2.000 billion revolving credit facility (the 2015 Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks and terminated our previous $2.000 billion revolving credit facility. The 2015 Facility matures in April 2020. There were no amounts borrowed under our current or prior revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2015 or December 31, 2014. We also maintain a $300 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables maturing on June 9, 2017. We had no borrowings outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014.Term LoansIn April 2015, we entered into a $750 million, unsecured term loan facility (2015 Term Loan). We had $750 million outstanding under the 2015 Term Loan as of December 31, 2015. 47In August 2013, we entered into a $400 million, unsecured term loan facility (2013 Term Loan). We had $250 million outstanding under the 2013 Term Loan as of December 31, 2015 and $400 million outstanding as of December 31, 2014.Our revolving credit facility and our term loan facilities require that we maintain certain financial covenants as outlined in Note F - Borrowings and Credit Agreements to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As of and through December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Any inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facility or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers. Senior NotesWe had $4.650 billion of senior notes outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and $3.800 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2014. Our senior notes are publicly registered securities, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to borrowings under our credit and security facility, to the extent if directly borrowed by our subsidiaries and liabilities of our subsidiaries.The debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2015 is as follows: (in millions)2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 Thereafter TotalSenior Notes$— $250 $600 $— $1,450 $2,350 $4,650Term Loans— 85 390 150 375 — 1,000 $— $335 $990 $150 $1,825 $2,350 $5,650Note:The table above does not include unamortized discounts associated with our senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes or debt issuance costs.Other ArrangementsWe have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries that we account for as sales under ASC Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. These agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties, without recourse, of up to approximately $392 million as of December 31, 2015. We de-recognized $151 million of receivables as of December 31, 2015 at an average interest rate of 2.4 percent, and $167 million as of December 31, 2014 at an average interest rate of 3.2 percent. In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with a commercial Japanese bank that provide for borrowings, promissory notes discounting and receivables factoring of up to 21.000 billion Japanese yen (approximately $175 million as of December 31, 2015). We de-recognized $132 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2015 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent and $134 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2014 at an average interest rate of 1.8 percent.As of December 31, 2015, we had outstanding letters of credit of $44 million, as compared to $59 million as of December 31, 2014, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers' compensation insurance arrangements. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees.For additional details related to our debt, including our revolving credit facilities, term loans, senior notes and other arrangements, see Note F - Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.EquityDuring 2015 we received $114 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $60 million in 2014 and $74 million 2013. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.We repurchased 10 million shares for $125 million during 2014, and 51 million shares for $500 million during 2013. No share repurchases were made in 2015. As of December 31, 2015, we had remaining approximately $535 million authorized under our 2013 share repurchase program. There were approximately 248 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014. 48Stock-based compensation expense related to our stock equity compensation and ownership plans was $107 million in 2015, $103 million in 2014, and $105 million in 2013. Stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors: the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period; forfeiture levels related to unvested awards; and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2015.

Purchase obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.056 billion the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note J – Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits.With certain of our acquisitions, we acquired in-process research and development projects that require future funding to complete the projects. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the in-process research and development projects we acquired is between $100 million and $150 million. Net cash inflows from the projects currently in development are expected to commence in 2016 through 2024, following the respective launches of these technologies in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2015.Legal MattersFor a discussion of our material legal proceedings see Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require management’s judgment: Revenue Recognition, Bad Debt Reserves, Inventory Provisions, Valuation of Contingent Consideration Liabilities and Intangible Assets, Goodwill Valuation, Legal and Product Liability Accruals and Income Taxes. 49See Note A-Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information related to our accounting policies and our consideration of these critical accounting areas. In addition, see Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments and Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion on the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration; Note J -Income Taxes for further discussion on income tax related matters and Note K - Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion on legal and product liability matters.Revenue RecognitionWe allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.Many of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE® Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period. Generally, we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations; therefore, we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available; otherwise, we use our best estimate of selling price. We allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.Inventory ProvisionsWe base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration LiabilitiesWe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including in-process research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations, amortization expense, and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods.We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable,we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets, or more frequently if change in circumstance or indicators exist. We assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with 50the carrying value in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.Goodwill ValuationWe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the assessment, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. For our 2015, 2014 and 2013 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units, including Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation. During 2015, 2014 and 2013, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units’ future expected cash flows.If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative, we evaluate whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. If we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists, we then perform the second step of the goodwill test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value.Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.In the second quarter of 2015, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units, in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test. As a result of the 2015 annual goodwill impairment test, we identified our global Electrophysiology reporting unit as being at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. As of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, our global Electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 28 percent and held $292 million of allocated goodwill. Also, as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, our global Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) reporting unit had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 26 percent; however, due to goodwill impairment charges in prior years, no goodwill remains within our CRM reporting unit.On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill. The key variables that drive the cash flows of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth 51rates and levels of profitability. Terminal value growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC, are additional key variables for reporting unit cash flows. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges. For example, as of the date of our annual goodwill impairment test, keeping all other variables constant, a combined increase of 50 basis points in the WACC along with a simultaneous decrease of 150 basis points in the long term growth rate applied would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our global Electrophysiology reporting unit. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates represent management's best estimates, which we believe to be reasonable, but future declines in business performance may result in impairment of our goodwill.Legal and Product Liability AccrualsIn the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify. As such, significant judgment is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals. Our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us, including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us; trial court or appellate proceedings; and mediation, arbitration or settlement proceedings.Income TaxesWe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Therefore, judgment is required based on individual facts, circumstances and information available in determining whether or not based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes in determining our worldwide income tax position for all years subject to audit. New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note Q - New Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on Standards Implemented and Standards to be Implemented.Additional InformationUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures by Boston ScientificTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States.The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income (loss) and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income (loss) per share. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to this non-GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP financial measure that excludes sales from divested businesses is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this Annual Report.Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments’ measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance. 52We believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts, such as sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share•Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges - These charges represent (a) non-cash write-downs of certain intangible asset balances during 2015, 2014, and 2013; and (b) a non-cash write-down of our goodwill balance attributable to our global Cardiac Rhythm Management reporting unit in the first quarter of 2013. We remove the impact of non-cash impairment charges from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for us in measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, these charges are excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and are also excluded for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity. •Acquisition- and divestiture related net charges (credits) - These adjustments consist of (a) contingent consideration fair value adjustments; (b) gains on previously held investments; (c) purchased and/or funded in-process research and development expenses incurred outside of a business combination; (d) due diligence, other fees, inventory step-up amortization, and integration and exit costs; and (e) separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011. The contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments. Due diligence, other fees, inventory step-up amortization, and integration and exit costs include legal, tax, severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions and divestitures that can be highly variable and not representative of ongoing operations. Separation costs and gains on the sale of a business unit primarily represent those associated with the Neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. •Restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments represent primarily severance and other direct costs associated with our restructuring programs. These costs are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these costs for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. •Litigation-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments include certain significant product liability and other litigation-related charges and credits. These amounts are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. •Debt extinguishment charges - These charges represent premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.0 billion of public senior notes during the second quarter of 2015 and the early extinguishment of $1.450 billion of debt during the third quarter of 2013. These adjustments are not expected to recur and do not reflect expected ongoing operating results. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. •Pension termination charges - This item represents charges associated with the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan, a frozen defined benefit plan. These charges are not expected to recur after 2015 and do not reflect expected 53ongoing operating results. Accordingly, management has excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. •Amortization expense - Amortization expense is a non-cash expense and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the financial covenants included in our credit facility or our term loan facility agreements. Management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing our cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric for measuring our ability to generate cash and invest in our growth. Therefore, amortization expense is excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management has excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity. •Discrete tax items - These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions, which were initially established in prior periods in conjunction with the purchase accounting for an acquisition or as a result of intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- or litigation-related charges or credits. These adjustments do not reflect expected on-going operating results. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. Revenue Growth Rates Excluding the Impact of Sales from Divested Businesses and/or Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates•Sales from divested businesses are primarily associated with the Neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict. Accordingly, management excludes the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and revenue growth rates that exclude certain amounts, such as the sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes.Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans by Executive OfficersPeriodically, certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act and our own Stock Trading Policy. A Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amount, prices and dates (or formulas for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including shares issued upon exercise of stock options or vesting of deferred stock units. These plans are entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non-public information about our company. We disclose details regarding individual Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans on the Investor Relations section of our website. 54Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingAs the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2015, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below.The AMS Portfolio AcquisitionOn August 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the American Medical Systems male urology portfolio (AMS Portfolio Acquisition), which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. As permitted by the SEC Staff interpretive guidance for newly acquired businesses, management has excluded the AMS Portfolio Acquisition from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015 as the acquisition was completed in August 2015. We are permitted to omit an assessment of an acquired business's internal control over financial reporting from our assessment of internal control for up to one year from the acquisition date. The AMS Portfolio Acquisition represents 1% of our total assets and 2% of our total revenues as of December 31, 2015. /s/ Michael F. Mahoney /s/ Daniel J. Brennan Michael F. Mahoney Daniel J. Brennan President and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and ChiefFinancial Officer 55Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific CorporationWe have audited Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on criteria established in Internal Control---Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.As indicated in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the subsidiaries and assets of American Medical Systems that were acquired by Boston Scientific Corporation, which are included in the 2015 consolidated financial statements of Boston Scientific Corporation and constituted approximately 1% of total assets (excluding the goodwill and intangibles which were included in management’s assessment of the internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015) and approximately 2% of revenues for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of Boston Scientific Corporation also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the subsidiaries and assets of American Medical Systems that were acquired by Boston Scientific Corporation.In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2015, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 24, 2016 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLPBoston, MassachusettsFebruary 24, 2016 56ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $3.547 billion as of December 31, 2015 and $4.648 billion as of December 31, 2014. We recorded $237 million of other assets and $23 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2015, as compared to $419 million of other assets and $36 million of other liabilities as of December 31, 2014. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $155 million as of December 31, 2015 and $210 million as of December 31, 2014. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $189 million as of December 31, 2015 and by $257 million as of December 31, 2014. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operations.Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We entered into interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of $450 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 to convert fixed-rate debt associated with certain of our senior notes into floating-rate debt, and subsequently terminated these hedges during the first quarter of 2015. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, $4.675 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates, representing approximately 82 percent of our total debt.See Note E – Fair Value Measurements to our 2015 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding our derivative financial instruments. 57Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific CorporationWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2015.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for further information on our core businesses and products. 3CardiovascularInterventional CardiologyDrug-Eluting Coronary Stent SystemsOur broad, innovative product offerings have enabled us to become a leader in the global interventional cardiology market. This leadership is due in large part to our drug-eluting coronary stent product offerings. Coronary stents are tiny, mesh tubes used in the treatment of coronary artery disease, which are implanted in patients to prop open arteries and facilitate blood flow to and from the heart. We believe we have further enhanced the outcomes associated with the use of coronary stents, particularly the processes that lead to restenosis (the growth of neointimal tissue within an artery after angioplasty and stenting), through scientific research and product development of drug-eluting stent systems. We market the SYNERGY™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System featuring an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating. The SYNERGY Stent is unique in that both its proprietary polymer and everolimus drug coating dissipate by three months. This innovation has the potential to improve post-implant vessel healing and will eliminate long-term polymer exposure, which is a possible cause of late adverse events. In addition, we market the Promus PREMIER™, Promus™ Element™ and Promus™ Element™ Plus Everolimus-Eluting Stents.Other Coronary TherapiesWe market a broad line of products used to treat patients with atherosclerosis, a principal cause of coronary artery obstructive disease, which is characterized by a thickening of the walls of the coronary arteries and a narrowing of arterial openings caused by the progressive development of deposits of plaque. Our product offerings include balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, crossing and re-entry devices for the treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures. PCI GuidanceWe market a family of intravascular catheter-directed ultrasound imaging catheters, fractional flow reserve (FFR) devices, and systems for use in coronary arteries and heart chambers as well as certain peripheral vessels. Our Intravascular Ultrasound Imaging catheter, OptiCross™, has been launched in all major markets worldwide. We initiated the launch of our first FFR product, the COMET™ Pressure Guidewire, in the U.S., Europe, and Japan in 2016. The iLab™ Ultrasound Imaging System with Polaris Software continues as our flagship console and is compatible with our full line of imaging catheters and FFR devices and are designed to enhance the diagnosis and treatment of blocked vessels and heart disorders. These systems have been placed in cardiology labs worldwide and provided an installed base through which we expect to continue to pull through products, including the ongoing launch of our COMET™ FFR Pressure Guidewire. Structural Heart TherapiesStructural heart therapy is one of the fastest growing segments of the medical technology market and is highly synergistic with our Interventional Cardiology and Rhythm Management businesses. Through the acquisition of Sadra Medical, Inc. (Sadra) in January 2011, we have developed a fully repositionable and retrievable device, the Lotus™ Valve System, for transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis. The Lotus™ Valve System employs a unique Adaptive Seal™ feature designed to minimize the incidence of paravalvular regurgitation, a predictor of mortality. The Lotus™ Valve System is CE-marked in the European Union (EU). In the U.S. it is an investigational device and not available for commercial sale. At the end of 2015, we completed enrollment in our REPRISE III pivotal clinical trial. We have three valve sizes CE marked: 23, 25 and 27mm, and we are developing 21 and 29mm size valves to complete our size matrix. In September 2016, we commenced a limited launch of our next generation catheter and sheath, the Lotus EDGE™ Valve System, in Europe. In October 2016, we suspended our limited launch and initiated a voluntary removal of field inventory of the Lotus EDGE™ system due to reports that, in some cases, the device could not be fully locked during the procedure due to premature release of a pin connecting the Lotus EDGE™ Valve to the delivery system. In February 2017, we initiated a voluntary removal of all Lotus™ Valve devices, including Lotus with Depth Guard™, from global commercial and clinical sites due to reports of premature release of a pin connecting the Lotus™ Valve to the delivery system. As with the prior announced suspension of our Lotus Edge™ Valve System device, we believe that the issue is caused by excess tension in the pin mechanism introduced during the manufacturing process. We expect to bring the Lotus™ Valve platform back to market in Europe and other regions in the fourth quarter of 2017. We anticipate filing the U.S. PMA submission for the Lotus Edge™ Valve System, the next generation platform, in the fourth quarter of 2017, with a U.S. launch planned for mid-2018. 4Through the acquisition of Atritech, Inc. (Atritech) in March 2011, we have developed a novel device, the Watchman™ Left Atrial Appendage Closure (LAAC) Device, designed to close the left atrial appendage to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF). Watchman Device has been commercially available internationally since 2009 and is the leading device in percutaneous LAAC globally. In March of 2015, Watchman Device received FDA approval to treat patients who are at an elevated risk of stroke, deemed suitable for warfarin, and have appropriate rationale to seek a non-pharmacologic alternative to warfarin. We believe that Watchman Device will be the only LAAC technology commercially available in the U.S. for multiple years, and in November 2015, we received CE Mark for our next generation device, Watchman FLX™ LAAC Device. Shortly after approval, we began a European initial market release of Watchman FLX™ Device. The initial market release was suspended near the end of the first quarter of 2016 due to a higher than expected rate of device embolization. Following an extensive data evaluation, we have decided to pursue certain design enhancements prior to returning a next generation device to market.On December 12, 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain manufacturing assets and capabilities of the Neovasc, Inc. advanced biological tissue business and made a 15 percent equity investment in Neovasc. With this acquisition, we will integrate certain manufacturing assets and biologic tissue capabilities into our structural heart business for use in the manufacturing of the Lotus™ Valve System and future heart valve technologies within our Interventional Cardiology business.We began the process of integrating Neovasc into our Interventional Cardiology business in the fourth quarter of 2016 and expect to be substantially complete by the end of 2018. Peripheral InterventionsWe sell various products designed to treat patients with peripheral arterial disease (disease which appears in blood vessels other than in the heart and in the biliary tree), including a broad line of medical devices used in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and peripheral vascular stenting. Our peripheral product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and vena cava filters. Our peripheral angioplasty balloon technology includes our next-generation Mustang™ PTA Balloon Catheter; our Coyote™ Balloon Catheter, a highly deliverable and ultra-low profile balloon dilatation catheter designed for a wide range of peripheral angioplasty procedures; and our Charger™ PTA Balloon Catheter, a 0.035” percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon catheter designed for post-stent dilatation as well as conventional balloon angioplasty to open blocked peripheral arteries. With our Coyote, Mustang and Charger Devices, we offer balloons across all size platforms. Our peripheral stent technology includes our EPIC™ Self-Expanding Nitinol Stent System, our Carotid WALLSTENT™ Stent System, and our Innova™ Self-Expanding Stent System. In addition, we market our 0.035"" Rubicon™ Support Catheter in both the U.S. and Europe. We are currently conducting a pivotal study designed to evaluate the safety and performance of the Eluvia™ Drug-Eluting Vascular Stent System, which received CE Mark in February 2016 and is designed to treat patients with narrowing or blockages in the SFA or proximal popliteal artery (PPA). We are also conducting an additional study on the safety and effectiveness of our RANGER™ Drug-Coated Balloon.In August 2014, we acquired the Interventional Division of Bayer AG (Bayer). The addition of Bayer innovative technologies supports our strategy to provide a comprehensive portfolio of leading solutions to treat peripheral vascular disease, including venous disease. The transaction included the leading AngioJet™ Thrombectomy System which is used in endovascular procedures to remove blood clots from blocked arteries and veins, and the JetStream™ Atherectomy System, used to remove plaque and thrombi from diseased arteries. We have since launched the AngioJet™ ZelanteDVT™ Thrombectomy Catheter to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in large-diameter upper and lower limb peripheral veins, in the U.S. and Europe. We also sell products designed to treat patients with non-vascular disease (disease that appears outside the blood system), primarily in interventional oncology. Our non-vascular suite of products includes biliary stents, drainage catheters and micro-puncture sets designed to treat, diagnose and ease various forms of benign and malignant tumors. We market our Direxion™ Torqueable Microcatheter in both the U.S. and Europe. In addition, we continue to market our extensive line of interventional oncology product solutions, including the Renegade™ HI-FLO™ Fathom™ Microcatheter and guidewire system and Interlock™ - 35 Fibered IDC™ and 18 Fibered IDC™ Occlusion System for peripheral embolization. On December 31, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the interventional radiology business of CeloNova Biosciences (CeloNova). The acquisition includes drug-eluting microspheres designed to be loaded with chemotherapy drugs for delivery to cancerous tumors, and spherical embolic products used to treat uterine fibroids and other conditions. We are in the process of integrating CeloNova into our Peripheral Interventions business and expect to be substantially complete by the second half of 2017. 5Rhythm ManagementCardiac Rhythm ManagementWe develop, manufacture and market a variety of implantable devices that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities, including: •Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) systems used to detect and treat abnormally fast heart rhythms (tachycardia) that could result in sudden cardiac death, including the world's only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardiac defibrillators (S-ICD), along with implantable transvenous cardiac defibrillators and implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems used to treat heart failure; and•Implantable pacemaker systems used to manage slow or irregular heart rhythms (bradycardia), including implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (CRT-P) systems used to treat heart failure.

We are in the process of integrating Cosman into our Neuromodulation business, and expect the integration to be substantially complete by the end of 2017. Research and DevelopmentOur investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth. We expended $920 million on research and development in 2016, $876 million in 2015, and $817 million in 2014. Our investment in research and development reflects the following:•internal research and development programs, regulatory design, and clinical science, as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances; and 8•engineering efforts that incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and next-generation products.We have directed our development efforts toward innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets. We are transforming how we conduct research and development and are scrutinizing our cost structure, which we believe will enable increased development activity and faster concept to market timelines. Our approach to new product design and development is through focused, cross-functional teams. We believe that our formal process for technology and product development aids in our ability to offer and manufacture innovative products in a consistent and timely manner. Involvement of the cross-functional teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle. We believe this collaboration allows these teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies, and focus on bringing them to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. In addition to internal development, we work with hundreds of leading research institutions, universities and clinicians around the world to develop, evaluate and clinically test our products. We are expanding our collaborations to include research and development teams in emerging markets; these teams will focus on both global and local market requirements at a lower cost of development. We believe that a part of our future success will depend upon the strength of these development efforts.Marketing and SalesDuring 2016, we marketed our products to approximately 35,000 hospitals, clinics, outpatient facilities and medical offices in the U.S. and to approximately 120 countries worldwide. The majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations. We also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets. We expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third party distributors in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence. No single institution accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2016, 2015 or 2014; however, large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales. We have a dedicated corporate sales organization in the U.S. focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks. We consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers. Each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focused on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions. We believe that this focus on disease state management enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with physicians. We believe that we have positive working relationships with physicians and others in the medical industry which enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to the changing needs of physicians and their patients. International OperationsInternational net sales accounted for approximately 43 percent of our net sales in 2016. Maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Through our international presence, we seek to increase net sales and market share, leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs, accelerate the time to bring new products to market, and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines. In addition, we are investing in infrastructure in emerging markets in order to strengthen our sales capabilities and maximize our opportunities in these countries.As of December 31, 2016, we had six principal international manufacturing facilities, including three in Ireland, two in Costa Rica and one in Puerto Rico. Approximately 45 percent of our products manufactured in 2016 were produced at these facilities. Additionally, we maintain research and development capabilities in Ireland, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Germany, India and China. We operate physician training centers in France, Japan, South Africa, Germany, Italy and India.Manufacturing and Raw MaterialsWe are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization. We continually strive to improve the efficiency of our Sourcing Operations, and to partner with strategic suppliers to leverage the technical expertise of the broader market. By doing so, we seek to focus our internal resources on the development and commercial launch of new products, and the enhancement of existing products. We continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs, and continue our focus on process controls and validations, supplier controls, distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the training and tools necessary to drive continuous improvement in product quality. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to identify cost-improvement opportunities in order to enhance our operational effectiveness. 9Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing and distribution capabilities, and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter. Many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We also have an on-going program to identify single-source components and to develop alternative back-up supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs. Quality AssuranceWe are committed to providing high quality products to our customers. Our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product, component specification process and the manufacturing, sale and servicing of the product. Our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life. These systems are designed to enable us to satisfy the various international quality system regulations, including those of the FDA with respect to products sold in the U.S. All of our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are certified under the ISO13485 quality system standard, established by the International Standards Organization for medical devices, which requires, among other items, an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. This certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a company’s quality system by an independent outside auditor. Maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic re-examination.Environmental Regulation and ManagementWe are subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe that sound environmental, health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers, stockholders and employees. We are focused on continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution, the depletion of natural resources, and our overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we are working to optimize energy and resource usage, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste. We are certified to the FTSE4Good Corporate Social Responsibility Index, managed by The Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility. This certification recognizes our dedication to those standards, and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policies.We have obtained ISO 14001:2004 certifications at our major manufacturing plants and Tier 1 distribution centers around the world, as well as our Corporate Headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts. ISO 14001:2004 is a globally recognized standard for Environmental Management Systems, established by the International Standards Organization, which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business. Using this environmental management system and the specific attributes of our certified locations in the U.S., Ireland, Costa Rica and the Netherlands, we continue to improve our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprint.CompetitionWe encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products from various companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories; Medtronic plc; and Cook Medical; as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, such as pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states which could also be treated using our products.We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers; while also continuing to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures safely and effectively in a less-invasive manner, as well as to provide ease of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current environment of managed care, with economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. 10We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and addressable market sizes. We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to: offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes; create or acquire innovative, scientifically advanced technologies; apply our technology and solutions cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets; develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions; attract and retain skilled personnel; obtain patent or other protection for our products; obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals; continually enhance our quality systems; manufacture and successfully market our products and solutions either directly or through outside parties; and supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demand.Medical Device Regulatory ApprovalsThe medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of medical devices. Devices are generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control, based on the risk level of the device. In the U.S., authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of three ways. The first process requires that a premarket notification (510(k)) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device, the “predicate” device. Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.The second process requires the submission of a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices, and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose, and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). For novel technologies, the FDA will generally seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process.The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) be made to the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). An HUD is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects, or is manifested in, fewer than 4,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE is similar in both form and content to a PMA application, but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA. The HUD provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populations.In the European Economic Area (EEA), we are required to comply with applicable Medical Device Directives, specifically the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive, and obtain CE Mark Certification in order to market medical devices within the EEA. The CE Mark is applied depending on device classification, either following approval from the appointed independent Notified Body or through self-certification. CE Marking is a symbol of compliance to the applicable Essential Requirements of the Medical Devices Directive and associated Standards. The EU regulatory bodies will finalize a new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in 2017, which will replace the existing Directives and will provide three years for transition and compliance. The MDR will change several aspects of the existing regulatory framework, such as clinical data requirements, and introduce new ones, such as Unique Device Identification (UDI). We, and the Notified Bodies who will oversee compliance to the new MDR, face uncertainties as the MDR is rolled out and enforced by the Commission and EEA Competent Authorities, creating risks in several areas including the CE Marking process and data transparency in the upcoming years.We are also required to comply with the regulations of each other country where we commercialize products before we can launch new products, such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) and China Food and Drug Administration. Many countries that previously did not have medical device regulations, or minimal such regulations, are now introducing them. For example, India is in the process of establishing new medical device regulations.The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record keeping, reporting of adverse events, 11labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country, or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations.International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.Government Affairs We maintain a global Government Affairs presence, headquartered in Washington, D.C., to actively monitor and advocate on myriad legislation and policies impacting us, both on a domestic and an international front. The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress and committee staff, the White House and Administration offices, state legislatures and regulatory agencies, and governments overseas on issues affecting our business. Our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal, state and global decision-makers, while also advancing our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions, key priorities and the value of our technologies. The Government Affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in general.Healthcare PoliciesPolitical, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments, and health care delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers, and other stakeholders may be significant and new therapies may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption.The impact to our business of the United States’ Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (ACA) provisions related to coverage expansion, payment reforms, and delivery system has been immaterial. The ACA and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. The legislation imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. In December 2015, the Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act, or PATH Act, was passed, which included legislation which temporarily suspended the 2.3 percent excise tax until December 31, 2017. We have substantially reinvested the amounts we would have expended on this tax into jobs, innovation, research and development, collaborations with universities, and other initiatives that will help treat patients and drive revenue growth.The Federal government, as part of the ACA, and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency, or ""sunshine,"" in relationships between medical device, biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals (HCPs). As a result, we are required by law to report many types of payments and items of value provided to HCPs. Certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws. Failure to comply with sunshine laws and/or implement and adhere to adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations. 12The federal election results in the U.S. may result in changes to insurance coverage, financing of insurance coverage in both the employer-sponsored insurance and individual markets, government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and federal sunshine laws. At this point, the impact of any such changes through repeal of, or major changes to, the ACA is unclear because specific changes in laws have not been enacted. Similarly, the status of the medical device tax after December 31, 2017 is not clear. While the specific policies that the new Administration and Congress may enact are not known, as noted below, we expect certain trends to continue placing pressure on pricing in the U.S.We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, preferential site of service payments, value-based purchasing, and accountable care organizations (ACOs) continue to take shape globally. We also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing globally as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other groups continue to seek to aggregate purchasing power. Similarly, governments are increasing the use of tenders, placing pressure on medical device pricing. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan and Europe and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products, which in turn may influence a hospital’s or physician's selection of products used to treat patients.Third-Party Coverage and ReimbursementOur products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including government programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S.) and private insurance payers, for the services provided to their patients.Third-party payers and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Coverage decisions by payers for these technologies and associated procedures are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value of the technologies and associated procedures.Proprietary Rights and Patent LitigationWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2016, we held more than 19,000 patents, and had approximately 6,000 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license, except for those relating to our drug-eluting coronary stent systems, is material in relation to our business as a whole.We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties. We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims, and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. See Item 3 and Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2016 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of intellectual property, product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved. 13EmployeesAs of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 27,000 employees, including approximately 13,000 in operations; 9,000 in selling, marketing and distribution; 4,000 in clinical, regulatory and research and development; and 3,000 in administration. Of these employees, we employed approximately 14,000 outside the U.S., approximately 8,000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function.Community OutreachWe are committed to Advancing Science to transform the lives of others and the communities we all call home. We bring this commitment to life by supporting local, regional and global health and education initiatives, striving to improve patient advocacy, adhering to strong ethical standards that deliver on our commitments, and minimizing our impact on the environment. We know that the world can be transformed when we apply the forces of compassion and the spirit of possibility to make a difference in communities today and in the future. When people have greater access to healthcare and health information, and when children are given the opportunity to achieve academically, communities become healthy and vibrant. For example, by working with Project HOPE (Health Opportunities for People Everywhere) in 2016, thousands of people in the Ranchi District in India and in rural Johannesburg, South Africa were screened for chronic diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension. Not only were people informed about their health risks and educated about prevention, but new screening protocols were implemented and healthcare workers were trained to provide services well into the future. Our focus on the next generation of innovators is evident in the over 150 Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) events and school programs we collaborated on with others to support the ever-curious minds of young learners around the world. Last year, more than 3,000 employee volunteers dedicated their time and talent to make a positive impact at more than 350 global community events in 21 countries.Through the Boston Scientific Foundation, more than 40 nonprofit organizations across the U.S. received nearly a million dollars in grant awards in 2016. These community grants are targeted to benefit disadvantaged populations by investing in programs that increase access to quality healthcare and improve educational opportunities, particularly related to STEM education. In addition, the Foundation also provides scholarships to college-bound students of U.S. based Boston Scientific employees.SeasonalityOur worldwide sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality; however, customer purchases have historically been lower in the third quarter of the year, as compared to other quarters. This reflects, among other factors, lower demand during summer months in the northern hemisphere, particularly in European countries.Available Information Copies of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the ""Exchange Act""), are available free of charge on our website (www.bostonscientific.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file the material with or furnish it to the U.S. SEC.

RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements set forth at the end of Item 1 of this Annual Report. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.We face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The medical device markets in which we primarily participate are highly competitive. We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do, including as a result of consolidation among our competitors in the healthcare industry. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories; Medtronic plc; and Cook Medical, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or which participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, including pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our products.Additionally, the medical device markets in which we primarily participate are characterized by extensive research and development, and rapid technological change. Developments by other companies of new or improved products, processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales. We are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards. If we fail to develop or acquire new products or enhance existing products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a delay in the timing of the launch of next-generation products, and the overall performance of, and continued physician confidence in, those products may result in declines in our market share and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We may experience declines in market size, average selling prices for our products, medical procedure volumes, and our share of the markets in which we compete, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We continue to experience pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity, increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates, economic pressures experienced by our customers, and the impact of managed care organizations and other third-party payers. These and other factors may adversely impact market sizes, as well as our share of the markets in which we compete, the average selling prices for our products or medical procedure volumes. There can be no assurance that the size of the markets in which we compete will increase above existing levels, that we will be able to regain or gain market share or compete effectively on the basis of price or that the number of procedures in which our products are used will increase above existing levels. Decreases in market sizes or our market share and declines in average selling prices or procedural volumes could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.Continued consolidation in the healthcare industry or additional governmental controls exerted over pricing in key marketscould lead to increased demands for price concessions or limit or eliminate our ability to sell to certain of our significant market segments, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payers to curb the rising cost of healthcare have catalyzed a consolidation of aggregate purchasing power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services is expected to continue to intensify, resulting in pricing pressures, decreased average selling prices, and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may increase competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and services and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. 18Healthcare cost containment pressures, government payment and delivery system reforms, changes in private payer policies, and marketplace consolidations could decrease the demand for our products, the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and the number of procedures performed using our devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the United States) and private health plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. Governments and payers may also institute changes in health care delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of health care costs. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental third-party payers is critical to the success of medical technology companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies. Even if we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payers. Further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the United States, Japan, or other countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures, including price regulation, competitive bidding and tendering, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, heightened clinical data requirements, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operationsWe are subject to a number of market, business, financial, legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations that could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. International net sales accounted for approximately 43 percent of our global net sales in 2016, with sales from emerging markets accounting for approximately 10 percent. An important part of our growth strategy is to continue pursuing growth opportunities in net sales and market share outside of the U.S. by expanding global presence, including in emerging markets. Our international operations are subject to a number of market, business and financial risks and uncertainties, including those related to political and economic instability; foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations; competitive product offerings; local changes in health care financing and payment systems and health care delivery systems; local product preferences and requirements, including preferences for local manufacturers; workforce instability; less intellectual property protection in certain countries than exists in the United States; and, in certain foreign countries, longer accounts receivable cycles. Such risks and uncertainties may adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy in these markets and, as a result, our sales growth, market share and operating profits from our international operations may be adversely affected. Our international operations are subject to established and developing legal and regulatory requirements for medical devices in each country in which our products are marketed and sold. Most foreign countries have medical device regulations. Further, most countries outside of the U.S. require product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis in order to continue to be marketed and sold there. In addition, several countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, on existing regulations, including requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data. These factors have caused or may cause us to experience more uncertainty, risk, expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions, which could affect our ability to obtain approvals for our products in those jurisdictions and adversely impact our net sales, market share and operating profits from our international operations.Further, international markets are affected by economic pressure to contain healthcare costs, which can lead to more rigorous evidence requirements and lower reimbursement rates for either our products directly or procedures in which our products are used. Governments and payers may also institute changes in health care delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of health care costs. In addition, certain international markets may also be affected by foreign government efforts to reference reimbursement rates in other countries. All of these types of changes may ultimately reduce selling prices of our products or reduce the number of procedures in which our products are used, which may adversely impact our net sales, market share and operating profits from our international operations.In addition, our international operations are subject to other established and developing U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and/or similar laws in other countries; and U.S. and foreign import and export controls and licensing requirements, trade protection and embargo measures and customs laws. Global businesses, including those in the medical device industry, are facing increasing scrutiny of, and heightened enforcement efforts with respect to, their international operations. Any alleged or actual failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may subject us to government scrutiny, civil and/or criminal proceedings, sanctions and other liabilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our international operations, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity. 19Following a referendum in June 2016 in which voters in the United Kingdom (UK) approved an exit from the EU, the UK government is expected to initiate a process to withdraw from the EU (often referred to as “Brexit”) and begin negotiating the terms of the UK’s future relationship with the EU. A withdrawal could, among other outcomes, result in the deterioration of economic conditions, volatility in currency exchange rates, and increased regulatory complexities. These outcomes may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any significant changes in the political and economic, financial, competitive, legal and regulatory or reimbursement conditions where we conduct, or plan to expand, our international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to manage our debt levels, maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies, or experience a disruption in our cash flows it could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing, financial condition or results of operations.As part of our strategy to maximize stockholder value, we use financial leverage to reduce our cost of capital. Our outstanding debt balance was $5.484 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $5.677 billion as of December 31, 2015. Although we currently have investment grade ratings at Moody's Investor Service, Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Fitch Ratings, our inability to maintain investment grade credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing funds in the future. Delays in our product development and new product launches disruption in our cash flow or our ability to continue to effectively manage our debt levels could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our credit and security facilities contain covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and place other limits on our business. If we are unable to satisfy these covenants, we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all, and we could be required to repay any borrowings on demand.We may record future goodwill impairment charges or other asset impairment charges related to one or more of our global reporting units, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. In the second quarter of 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, it was deemed not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testing.On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or small changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our strategy to realign our business portfolio, we completed several acquisitions in 2016, 2015 and 2014 and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future. Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including corporate restructuring, the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, regulatory, supply chain, manufacturing, quality systems and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant management time. Some of the factors that could affect the success of our acquisitions include, among others, the effectiveness of our due diligence process, our ability to execute our business plan for the acquired companies, the strength of the acquired technology, results of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures, the continued performance of critical transition services, our ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and retain key employees, and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies, such as increasing sales of our products, achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products. In addition, foreign acquisitions involve unique risks, including those related to integration of operations across different geographies, cultures, and languages; currency risks; and risks associated with the economic, political, legal and regulatory environment in specific countries. Our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business and our future growth. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain 20so, and if our acquisitions are not successful, we may record related asset impairment charges in the future or experience other negative consequences on our results.We may not be successful in our strategy relating to future strategic acquisitions of, investments in, or alliances with, other companies and businesses, which have been a significant source of historical growth for us, and will be key to our diversification into new markets and technologies.Our strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective, high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. These acquisitions, investments and alliances have been a significant source of our growth. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions, investments and alliances, we may be unable to grow our business. The success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions, investments or alliances will depend on a number of factors, including:•our ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance, if at all;•the ability of our due diligence process to uncover potential issues with target companies;•our ability to finance any future acquisition, investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us, if at all;•whether we are able to complete acquisitions, investments or alliances in a timely manner on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all; •our ability to successfully integrate and operate acquired businesses;•our ability to successfully identify and retain key target employees;•our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including foreign laws and regulations; and•intellectual property and litigation related to newly acquired technologies. Any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing, depending on their size or nature.We may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives; our long-term expense reduction programs may result in an increase in short-term expense; and our efforts may lead to unintended consequences. We monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make investments in research and development projects, capital and our people that we believe are important to our long-term success. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken restructuring and optimization initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. For example, in June 2016, we announced a restructuring initiative (the “2016 Restructuring Plan”) intended to develop global commercialization, technology and manufacturing capabilities in key growth markets, build on our Plant Network Optimization (PNO) strategy which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities, and expand operational efficiencies in support of our operating income margin goals. Key activities under the 2016 Restructuring Plan include strengthening global infrastructure through evolving global real estate and workplaces, developing global commercial and technical competencies, enhancing manufacturing and distribution expertise in certain regions, and continuing implementation of our PNO strategy. Activities under the plan were initiated in the second quarter of 2016 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2018. The 2016 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $175 million to $225 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $115 million to $150 million by the end of 2020 as program benefits are realized. We expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. Expense reduction initiatives under the plan include various cost and efficiency improvement measures, which may include movement of business activities, facility consolidations and closures, and the transfer of product lines between manufacturing facilities, which, due to the highly regulated nature of our industry, requires a significant investment in time and cost to create duplicate manufacturing lines, run product validations, and seek regulatory approvals. These measures could yield unintended consequences, such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, inability to attract or retain key personnel, and reduced employee productivity, which could negatively affect our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our restructuring and optimization initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results. We cannot guarantee that the activities under the 2016 Restructuring Plan or other optimization initiatives will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings. 21Current domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Uncertainty about global economic conditions, including as a result of credit and sovereign debt issues, has caused and may continue to cause disruption in the financial markets, including diminished liquidity and credit availability. These conditions may adversely affect our suppliers, leading them to experience financial difficulties or to be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products, particularly capital equipment, or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, we have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries. Continued deterioration of the global economy or increase in sovereign debt issues may impact our ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain of those countries in the future. Third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt. This could result in terminations of, or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs. Such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding.The strength and timing of economic recovery remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy. Accordingly, we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions, including sovereign debt issues and increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the U.S. and abroad, may continue to negatively impact our average selling prices, net sales and profit margins, procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payers. In addition, conditions in the financial markets and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our ability to borrow money in the credit markets, access the capital markets and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes.Healthcare policy changes, including healthcare reform legislation, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Political, economic and policy influences are leading the healthcare industry to make substantial structural and financial changes that will continue affecting our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies, and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary and evidence necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers, and other stakeholders may be significant and it may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption. Moreover, there can be no assurance that our strategies will succeed for every product.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 were enacted into law in the U.S. in March 2010. As a U.S. headquartered company with significant sales in the United States, the medical device tax included in this law has materially affected us. The law imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. Under the current administration, there may be a permanent repeal or an alteration of some or all elements of the ACA, but at this time it is not definite that a change will be enacted or what new healthcare provisions may be implemented. While the implementation of the medical device tax has been suspended until December 31, 2017, the status of the tax for sales after December 31, 2017 is not clear. The tax may continue to be suspended, or may be reinstated at the same or at a different level. Other provisions of this law, including comparative effectiveness research, pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies and other changes to the payment systems, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may adversely affect our business and results of operations.We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for either our products and/or procedures using our products, reduce medical procedure volumes or increase cost containment pressures on us or others in the healthcare sector could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 22We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products. Our products, marketing, sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act), by comparable agencies in foreign countries, and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDC Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval or an exemption from such clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In the European Union, we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives (including the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive) and obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:•take a significant period of time;•require the expenditure of substantial resources;•involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance;•require changes to products; and•result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. In addition, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin or legal manufacturer first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where renewal or recertification applications are required, they may need to be renewed and/or approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements.Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent, and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations. Certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local preclinical and clinical data in addition to global data. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products, or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future. The European Union regulatory bodies will finalize a new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in 2017, which will replace the existing Directives and will provide three years for transition and compliance. The MDR will change several aspects of the existing regulatory framework, such as clinical data requirements, and introduce new ones, such as Unique Device Identification (UDI). We, and the Notified Bodies who will oversee compliance to the new MDR, face uncertainties as the MDR is rolled out and enforced by the Commission and EEA Competent Authorities, creating risks in several areas including the CE Marking process and data transparency in the upcoming years.The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices; detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices; order repair, replacement or refund of these devices; and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA can take action against a company that promotes ""off-label"" uses. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDC Act and other amending Acts pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Any adverse regulatory action, depending 23on its magnitude, may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products, may limit a company's ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals, and could results in a substantial modification to the company's business practices and operations. International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our business. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our products are continually subject to clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or other third parties, the results of which may be unfavorable, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the FDA's or the market's perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.Our future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and enhancement of existing products, which requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals, all of which may be very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in commercially viable products.In order to develop new products and enhance existing products, we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and businesses. The development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate, and develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and abroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products, and gain and maintain market approval of our products. There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. If we are unable to develop and launch new products and enhanced products, our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted. Further, we are continuing to investigate, and have completed several acquisitions that involve opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into priority growth areas by accessing new products and technologies. There can be no assurance that our investments will be successful or we will be able to access new products and technologies on terms favorable to us, or that these products and technologies will achieve commercial feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of new products and technologies or our decision to reduce our investments may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth.Additionally, certain products or groups of products, in particular new products or enhancements of existing products, may have a disproportionate impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to meet growth projections, poor clinical outcomes, increasing regulatory requirements, launch delays, and inability to effectively scale manufacturing and achieve targeted margins with respect to any of these products or groups of products in particular may materially adversely impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. 24The medical device industry and its customers continue to face scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and are often the subject of numerous investigations, often involving marketing and other business practices or product quality issues including device recalls or advisories. These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings; imposition of substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, including corporate integrity agreements, stipulated judgments or exclusion; diversion of our employees and management's attention; imposition of administrative costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity; and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future. The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities continue to highly scrutinize our industry. We have received, and in the future may receive, subpoenas and other requests for information from Congress and other state and federal governmental agencies, including, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and the Department of Defense, as well as from foreign governments and agencies. The requests and/or subpoenas we have received relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance and sale and/or product promotional practices. We have cooperated with these subpoenas and other requests for information, and expect to continue to do so in the future. We cannot predict when a matter will be resolved, the outcome of the matter or its impact on us, and cooperation may involve significant costs, including document production costs. An adverse outcome in any matter could include the commencement of an investigation, civil and criminal proceedings; substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs, entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies and amendments to any existing CIAs. In addition, resolution of any matter could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations. For example, in 2009, we entered into a civil settlement with the DOJ regarding the DOJ's investigation relating to certain post-market surveys conducted by Guidant Corporation before we acquired Guidant in 2006. As part of the settlement, we entered into a 5-year CIA with the Office of Inspector General for HHS, which required various provisions, including enhancements to certain compliance procedures related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers. Cooperation with requests and investigations from external agencies result in employee resource costs and diversion of employee focus. If any requests or investigations continue over a long period of time, they could divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operations of our business and impose significant additional administrative burdens on us. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from these requests or investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.In addition, certain foreign governments, state governments (including that of Massachusetts, where we are headquartered) and the U.S. federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers. As an example, compliance with the U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires us by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals at the U.S. federal level made after August 1, 2013. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business. In addition, we have and may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement enhanced structure, policies, systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact our business.We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal cost and exposure to litigation, and have additional adverse effects on our operations.Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity.We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to on-going tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures. However, the calculation of such tax exposures involves the application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, as well as interpretations as to the legality under European Union state aid rules of tax advantages granted in certain jurisdictions. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves, and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.On July 19, 2016, we entered into a Stipulation of Settled Issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intended to resolve certain transfer pricing issues, as well as certain issues related to our transaction with Abbott, for the 2001 through 2007 tax years. The Stipulation of Settled Issues is contingent upon IRS Office of Appeals (IRS Appeals) applying the same basis of settlement to all transfer pricing issues for the Company’s 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years, and if applicable, review by the U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Taxation. In October 2016, we reached an agreement in principle with IRS Appeals as to the resolution of the 25transfer pricing issues in 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years, subject to additional calculations of tax as well as documentation to memorialize our agreement. The final resolution of these issues is contingent and if the Stipulation of Settled Issues is not finalized, it could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Additionally, changes in tax laws could materially impact our effective tax rate. For example, proposals for fundamental U.S. corporate tax reform, if enacted, could have a significant adverse impact on our future results of operations. Additionally, the U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business.Our operations in Puerto Rico and Costa Rica presently benefit from various tax incentives and grants. Unless these incentives and grants are extended, they will expire between 2023 and 2028. If we are unable to renew, extend, or obtain new incentive and grants, the expiration of the existing incentives and grants could have a material impact on our financial results in future periods.We may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Physician customers have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However, intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable and appellate courts can overturn lower court decisions. Furthermore, as our business increasingly relies on technology systems and infrastructure, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation. Finally, our ability to protect novel business models is uncertain. Competing parties in our industry frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies.A number of third parties have asserted that our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. We have similarly asserted that products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us. Adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Patents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business, and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others. We currently own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending. We also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash, cross-licensing rights or royalty payments. No assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that any current or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors, or that our patents will not be found invalid. In addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade secrets or know-how or to assert them against claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful. We are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual property-related actions. The invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own, or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 26In addition, the laws of certain countries in which we market, and plan on manufacturing some of our products in the near future, do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Furthermore, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses, unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation or misuse thereof by those with permitted access, and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property and other data, and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber-attacks or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.We rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information, and changing customer patterns. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients or disrupt performance of our products or to access our proprietary information. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. In the U.S., Federal and State privacy and security laws require certain of our operations to protect the confidentiality of personal information including patient medical records and other health information. In Europe, the Data Protection Directive requires us to manage individually identifiable information in the EU and, the new General Data Protection Regulation may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of violations. Internationally, some countries have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data. We believe that we meet the expectations of applicable regulations and that the ongoing costs and impacts of ensuring compliance with such rules are not material to our business. However, there is no guarantee that we will avoid enforcement actions by governmental bodies. Enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. Any of these events, in turn, may cause us to lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting, and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians, and other health care professionals, be subject to legal claims and liability, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Pending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.We operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and, in recent years, it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies. We are currently the subject of various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2016 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy, and its outcome is difficult to predict. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial condition, results of operation or liquidity. Pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel. In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged, we may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us, if at all. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected. 27Pending and future product liability claims and other litigation, including private securities litigation, stockholder derivative suits and contract litigation, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or liquidity.The design, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. Many of the medical devices that we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell, including physician technique and experience in performing the surgical procedure, component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects, off-label use or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could result in product liability claims, a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.We are currently the subject of product liability litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2016 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, including not only actual damages, but also punitive damages. The magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in the future, regardless of the outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Additionally, we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims, and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The fact that we do not maintain third-party insurance coverage for all categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions, and these losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Any failure to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a medical device manufacturer, we are required to register our establishments and list our devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its Quality System Regulation requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the Federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA which may result in observations on Form 483, and in some cases warning letters, that require corrective action. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain International Standards Organization (ISO) certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. Many other countries in which we do business have requirements similar to those of the US or the EU, and other foreign governments or agencies may subject us to periodic inspections as well. If we, or our manufacturers, fail to adhere to quality system regulations or ISO requirements, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. In most cases, the manufacturing of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. Factors such as a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand. In the event of a significant interruption, for example, as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to needs for regulatory approvals. As a result, we may experience loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture, and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by third-party vendors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 28We purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from third-party vendors. Certain of these materials and components are purchased from single sources due to quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors' manufacturing processes. A reduction or interruption in the supply of materials and components used in manufacturing our products; an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required; or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale, and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service. To the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity, availability of materials for sterilization, regulatory or other constraints, we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizer, sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Our share price has been volatile and may fluctuate, and accordingly, the value of an investment in our common stock may also fluctuate.Stock markets in general, and our common stock in particular, have experienced significant price and volume volatility over recent years. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due to factors described under this Item 1A entitled “Risk Factors,” as well as economic and geopolitical conditions in general, and also to variability in the prevailing sentiment regarding our operations or business prospects, as well as, among other things, changing investment priorities of our stockholders. Because the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able sell their shares at attractive prices. If we are unable to attract or retain key personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations. In our industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate, and we may face increased competition for such employees, particularly in emerging markets as the trend toward globalization continues. Our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key personnel, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining and developing existing personnel or recruiting new personnel. The loss of one or more key employees, our ability to attract or develop additional qualified employees or any delay in hiring key personnel could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 29ITEM 1B.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSThe following discussion and analysis provides information management believes to be relevant to understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Boston Scientific Corporation and its subsidiaries. For full understanding of financial condition and results of operations, you should read this discussion along with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Executive Summary Financial Highlights and TrendsIn 2016, we generated net sales of $8.386 billion, as compared to $7.477 billion in 2015, an increase of $909 million, or 12 percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $99 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2016, as compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, our net sales increased $1.008 billion, or 12 percent, as compared to the prior year.1 This increase included net sales of approximately $236 million in 2016, with no prior year period related net sales, due to the AMS Portfolio Acquisition and the EndoChoice Holdings, Inc. (EndoChoice) acquisition. Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our net sales by global business.Our reported net income in 2016 was $347 million, or $0.25 per diluted share. Our reported results for 2016 included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related net charges, restructuring and restructuring-related net charges, litigation-related charges, and amortization expense totaling $1.187 billion (after-tax), or $0.86 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2016 was $1.534 billion, or $1.11 per share.1Our reported net loss in 2015 was $239 million, or $0.18 per share. Our reported results for 2015 included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related net charges, restructuring and restructuring-related net charges, litigation-related charges, pension termination charges, debt extinguishment charges, discrete tax items, and amortization expense totaling $1.506 billion (after-tax), or $1.11 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2015 was $1.267 billion, or $0.93 per share1. 1 Adjusted net sales growth rates, which exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share, which exclude certain items required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S GAAP) are not prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Refer to Additional Information for a discussion of management’s use of these non-GAAP financial measures. 34The following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to those adjusted results considered by management.

This increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by the increase in net income for 2016 compared to 2015. Our cash generated from operations continues to be a significant source of funds for investing in our growth, including acquisitions and strategic alliances, managing our contingencies and reducing our debt levels.As of December 31, 2016, we had total debt of $5.484 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $196 million and a working capital deficit of $348 million. We hold investment-grade ratings with all three major credit-rating agencies. We believe our investment grade credit profile reflects the size and diversity of our product portfolio, our leading share position in several of our served markets, our strong cash flow, our solid financial fundamentals and our financial strategy. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for further discussion. 35Business and Market OverviewCardiovascularInterventional Cardiology Our Interventional Cardiology division develops and manufactures technologies for diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular disorders including structural heart conditions. Product offerings include coronary stents, including drug-eluting and bare metal stent systems, balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, crossing and re-entry devices for the treatment of chronically occluded coronary vessels, diagnostic catheters, and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging systems. Our structural heart product offerings include a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement and a device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation that are at risk for ischemic stroke.Our worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products were $2.281 billion for 2016, or approximately 27 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year. Our worldwide net sales of Interventional Cardiology products increased $248 million, or 12 percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $34 million negative impact on our Interventional Cardiology net sales in 2016, as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $282 million, or 13 percent. This year-over-year increase was primarily related to sales of our drug-eluting stents, led by our ongoing global launch of the SYNERGY™ Stent, our WATCHMAN™ Device following the U.S. commercial launch during the first quarter of 2015 and our Lotus™ Valve System in the EU, along with operational growth in our PCI Guidance System product offerings.Worldwide sales from our drug-eluting coronary stents were $1.199 billion during 2016, as compared to $1.074 billion during 2015, representing a significant portion of our Interventional Cardiology net sales. Our drug-eluting stent systems include our next generation SYNERGY Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System and our Promus PREMIER™ Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System, both of which are designed to provide physicians with improved drug-eluting stent performance in treating patients with coronary artery disease. SYNERGY features an ultra-thin abluminal (outer) bioabsorbable polymer coating, while Promus PREMIER™ features a unique customized platinum chromium alloy stent architecture and an enhanced stent delivery system. We received FDA approval of the SYNERGY™ Stent technology and Japanese regulatory approval in the fourth quarter of 2015.Our structural heart product offerings include our Lotus™ Valve System, a device for transcatheter aortic valve replacement, and our WATCHMAN™ device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. The Lotus Valve System consists of a stent-mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve. The original Lotus Valve System as well as our next generation Lotus EDGE™ System are CE-marked in the European Union (EU), and in the U.S. they are investigational devices and not commercially available. In October 2016, we suspended our limited launch and initiated a voluntary removal of field inventory of the Lotus EDGE™ system due to reports that, in some cases, the device could not be fully locked during the procedure due to premature release of a pin connecting the Lotus EDGE™ Valve to the delivery system. In February 2017, we initiated a voluntary removal of all Lotus™ Valve devices, including Lotus with Depth Guard™, from global commercial and clinical sites due to reports of premature release of a pin connecting the Lotus™ Valve to the delivery system. As with the prior announced suspension of our Lotus Edge™ Valve System device, we believe that the issue is caused by excess tension in the pin mechanism introduced during the manufacturing process. We expect to bring the Lotus™ Valve platform back to market in Europe and other regions in the fourth quarter of 2017. We anticipate filing the U.S. PMA submission for the Lotus Edge™ Valve System, the next generation platform, in the fourth quarter of 2017, with a U.S. launch planned for mid-2018. The WATCHMAN Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology (WATCHMAN) is the first device studied in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to warfarin, and is marketed in CE-mark countries and other international countries, as well as the U.S. following FDA approval in March 2015. We believe that Watchman will be the only LAAC technology commercially available in the U.S. for multiple years. In November 2015, we received CE Mark for our next generation device, Watchman FLX™. Shortly after approval, we began a European initial market release of Watchman FLX. The initial market release was suspended near the end of the first quarter of 2016 due to a higher than expected rate of device embolization. Following an extensive data evaluation, we have decided to pursue potential design enhancements prior to returning a next generation device to market.On December 12, 2016, we completed the acquisition of certain manufacturing assets and capabilities of the Neovasc, Inc. (Neovasc) advanced biological tissue business and made a 15 percent equity investment in Neovasc for a total upfront cash payment of $75 36million. With this acquisition, we will integrate certain manufacturing assets and biologic tissue capabilities into our structural heart business for use in the manufacturing of the Lotus Valve System and future heart valve technologies within our Interventional Cardiology business. We expect this integration to be substantially completed by the end of 2018.Peripheral InterventionsOur Peripheral Interventions (PI) product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, wires, peripheral embolization devices and other devices used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease, along with products to treat, diagnose and ease various forms of cancer.Our worldwide net sales of PI products were $1.011 billion for 2016, or approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year. Our worldwide net sales of PI products increased $107 million, or 12 percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had an $11 million negative impact on our worldwide PI net sales in 2016, as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $118 million, or 12 percent. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by revenues from our Atherectomy and Thrombectomy systems, as well as growth in our core PI franchises, particularly our stent franchise following FDA approval and launch of our Innova™ Vascular self-expanding stent system in the U.S. and Japan, our interventional oncology franchise and our drug-eluting product franchise.On December 31, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the interventional radiology business of CeloNova Biosciences (CeloNova). The acquisition includes drug-eluting microspheres designed to be loaded with chemotherapy drugs for delivery to cancerous tumors, and spherical embolic products used to treat uterine fibroids and other conditions. We are in the process of integrating CeloNova into our Peripheral Interventions business and expect to be substantially complete by the second half of 2017. Rhythm ManagementCardiac Rhythm ManagementOur Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) business develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices including implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) systems and implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators, including the world's first and only commercially available subcutaneous implantable cardioverter defibrillator, the S-ICD System, and pacemaker systems that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities. In addition, in most geographies, we monitor device performance remotely, allowing for more frequent monitoring in order to guide treatment decisions.Our worldwide net sales of CRM products were $1.850 billion for 2016, or approximately 22 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year. Our worldwide net sales of CRM products increased $43 million, or two percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. Excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $17 million negative impact on our CRM net sales in 2016, as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $60 million, or three percent. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by strong global pacemaker growth including the U.S. launch of the ACCOLADE™ family of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) safe pacemakers and the Ingevity™ MRI pacing lead in the U.S., global growth from our quadripolar cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers (CRT-P), global S-ICD sales growth and benefits from our sales collaboration agreement with Preventice Solutions, Inc., (Preventice). In the U.S., the fourth quarter of 2016 represented our second full quarter of U.S. MRI pacemaker commercialization, the third quarter of commercialization for our Acuity™ X4 Quadripolar LV Pacing Lead in both the cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) and CRT-P franchises, and global commercialization of our EMBLEM™ MRI S-ICD system. These combined launches more than offset lower volumes of replacement procedures for our defibrillators due to their extended longevity and pressure from competitor high voltage MRI technologies primarily in the U.S. On April 30, 2015, we acquired a 27 percent ownership interest in Preventice, which includes 18.5 percent of Preventice's common stock. Preventice is a privately-held company headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, and a leading developer of mobile health solutions and services. In addition to the equity agreement, we entered into a commercial agreement with Preventice, under which we became Preventice’s exclusive, worldwide sales and marketing representative. In October 2016, we notified Preventice of our intent to terminate the commercial agreement and will transition the sales force back to Preventice in 2017 under the terms of the agreement. 37The following are the components of our CRM net sales: Year Ended(in millions) December 31, 2016 December 31, 2015Defibrillator systems $1,274 $1,313Pacemaker systems 576 494CRM products $1,850 $1,807ElectrophysiologyOur Electrophysiology business develops less-invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart. Our leading products include the Blazer™ line of ablation catheters, designed to deliver enhanced performance and responsiveness, and the Rhythmia™ Mapping System, a next-generation, catheter-based, 3-D cardiac mapping and navigation solution designed to help diagnose and treat a variety of arrhythmias.Our worldwide net sales of Electrophysiology products were $243 million for 2016, or approximately three percent of our consolidated net sales for the year. Our worldwide net sales of Electrophysiology products increased $10 million, or four percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a $3 million negative impact on our Electrophysiology net sales in 2016, as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $13 million, or five percent. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by increased sales of our Rhythmia Mapping System and related products. In the first quarter of 2016, we initiated a full European launch of our Blazer IntellaNav™ OI Catheter which is used with our Rhythmia Mapping System and, in July of 2016, we received FDA approval for this same catheter. In the second quarter of 2016, we received FDA approval for IntellaNav™ XP and the IntellaNav MiFi™ XP Navigation-Enabled Ablation Catheters that are used with the Rhythmia Mapping System. We also received FDA approval for our Blazer™ Open Irrigated System with Atrial Flutter indication and began full U.S. commercialization in the second quarter of 2016. Our global roll-out of our Rhythmia Mapping System, including early Europe commercialization of our next generation Rhythmia™ HDx System late in the fourth quarter, along with continued global expansion of our new navigation enabled therapeutic catheter portfolio, will continue as we expand our global Rhythmia installed base. MedSurgEndoscopyOur Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. Our worldwide net sales of Endoscopy products were $1.440 billion for 2016, or approximately 17 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year. Our worldwide net sales of Endoscopy products increased $134 million, or 10 percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $9 million impact on our Endoscopy net sales in 2016 as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $143 million, or 10 percent. This year-over-year increase was primarily driven by growth across several of our key product franchises, including our biliary device franchise with our SpyGlass™ DS Direct Visualization System and our AXIOS Stent and Electrocautery-Enhanced Delivery System for endoscopic ultrasound-guided transmural drainage of pancreatic pseudocysts; our metal stent franchise driven by our Biliary WallFlex® product family; and our hemostasis franchise, featuring our Resolution™ and Resolution 360™ Clips. This increase also includes revenue of approximately $10 million with no prior year period related net sales, due to the EndoChoice acquisition in November 2016, as described below.On November 22, 2016, we completed our acquisition of EndoChoice. EndoChoice is an Alpharetta, Georgia based company focused on the development and commercialization of infection control products, pathology services and single-use devices for specialists treating a wide range of gastrointestinal (GI) conditions. We began the process of integrating EndoChoice into our Endoscopy business in the fourth quarter of 2016 and expect to be substantially complete by the end of 2017. On November 1, 2016, we acquired the LumenR™ Tissue Retractor System from LumenR LLC (LumenR), a privately held Newark, California based company. The LumenR™ Tissue Retractor System is currently in development for use during endoscopic resection of lesions in the colon, esophagus or stomach.On April 2, 2015, we acquired Xlumena, Inc. (Xlumena), a medical device company that developed minimally invasive devices for Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) guided transluminal drainage of targeted areas within the gastrointestinal tract. In 2016, we completed the integration of Xlumena into our Endoscopy business. 38Urology and Pelvic HealthOur Urology and Pelvic Health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and pelvic conditions, such as kidney stones, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), erectile dysfunction, male incontinence, pelvic floor disorders, abnormal uterine bleeding, and uterine fibroids and polyps. Our worldwide net sales of Urology and Pelvic Health products were $1.005 billion for 2016, or approximately 12 percent of our consolidated net sales for the year. Our worldwide net sales of Urology and Pelvic Health products increased $312 million, or 45 percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $18 million impact on our Urology and Pelvic Health net sales in 2016, as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $330 million, or 45 percent. This year-over-year increase was primarily attributable to revenue of approximately $226 million with no prior year period related net sales, due to the AMS Portfolio Acquisition in August 2015, along with growth across all of our other global franchises, including our Pelvic Floor franchise as a result of market share gains primarily driven by a competitor exiting the market during the first quarter of 2016.On November 15, 2016, we completed the acquisition of the gynecology and urology portfolio of Distal Access, LLC (Distal), a Salt Lake City based company that designs minimally invasive medical devices. The portfolio includes the Resectr™ Tissue Resection Device, a single-use solution designed to remove uterine polyps. We began the process of integrating the Resectr device into our Urology and Pelvic Health business during the fourth quarter of 2016 and expect to be substantially complete by the end of 2017. On August 3, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the American Medical Systems male urology portfolio (AMS Portfolio Acquisition), which includes the men's health and prostate health businesses, from Endo International plc. The AMS male urology portfolio was integrated with our formerly named Urology and Women's Health business, and the joint businesses became Urology and Pelvic Health. The integration was substantially complete by the end of 2016.NeuromodulationOur Neuromodulation business offers the Precision™, Precision Spectra™, Precision Montage™ and Precision Novi™ Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) Systems, used for the management of chronic pain, and our Vercise™ Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) System in various international regions such as Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, tremor and intractable primary and secondary dystonia, a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products were $556 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or approximately seven percent of our consolidated net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products increased $55 million, or 11 percent, in 2016, as compared to 2015. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative $7 million impact on our Neuromodulation net sales in 2016, as compared to 2015, net sales of these products increased $62 million, or 12 percent. The year-over-year increase was primarily driven by share gains from our Montage™ System, continued adoption of the Precision Spectra™ SCS System in the U.S. and increased net sales in Europe, driven by our Vercise™ DBS Systems and non-rechargeable Precision Novi™ SCS System.On July 27, 2016, we acquired Cosman Medical, Inc. (Cosman), a privately held manufacturer of radiofrequency ablation systems, expanding our Neuromodulation portfolio and offering physicians treating patients with chronic pain a wider choice of non-opioid therapeutic options. We are in the process of integrating Cosman into our Neuromodulation business, and expect the integration to be substantially complete by the end of 2017. Emerging MarketsAs part of our strategic imperatives to drive global expansion, described in Item 1 of this Annual Report, we are seeking to grow net sales and market share by expanding our global presence, including in Emerging Markets. We define Emerging Markets as including 20 countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors, and our global capabilities. We are seeking to expand our presence and strengthen relationships in order to grow net sales and market share within our Emerging Markets, and we have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities. Our Emerging Markets revenue grew nine percent, as compared to the prior year, and was approximately 10 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2016. Excluding the impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, which had a negative impact of 11 percent, net sales in these markets grew 20 percent. 39Results of OperationsNet SalesWe manage our global businesses on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. Management excludes the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using standard internal currency exchange rates held constant for each year. The following table provides our net sales by global business and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. The constant currency growth rates in the tables below can be recalculated from our net sales presented in Note O - Segment Reporting to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Net sales that exclude the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and net sales from divested businesses are not financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from, or as a replacement for, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Refer to Additional Information of this Item 7 for a further discussion of management’s use of this non-GAAP financial measure. 2016 versus 2015 2015 versus 2014 Year EndedDecember 31, As ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasis As ReportedCurrencyBasisConstantCurrencyBasis(in millions)201620152014 Interventional Cardiology$2,281$2,033$2,057 12%13% (1)%7%Peripheral Interventions1,011904850 12%12% 6 %13%Cardiovascular3,2922,9372,907 12%12% 1 %9% Cardiac Rhythm Management1,8501,8071,912 2%3% (5)%1%Electrophysiology243233227 4%5% 2 %9%Rhythm Management2,0932,0402,139 3%3% (5)%1% Endoscopy1,4401,3061,323 10%10% (1)%6%Urology and Pelvic Health1,005693535 45%45% 30 %36%Neuromodulation556501472 11%12% 6 %8%MedSurg3,0012,5002,330 20%20% 7 %13% Subtotal Core Businesses8,3867,4777,376 12%12% 1 %8%Divested Businesses——4 N/AN/A N/AN/ANet Sales$8,386$7,477$7,380 12%12% 1 %8%Refer to Executive Summary for further discussion of our net sales and a comparison of our 2016 and 2015 net sales.In 2015, we generated net sales of $7.477 billion, as compared to $7.380 billion in 2014, an increase of $97 million, or one percent. Our net sales were unfavorably impacted by $505 million from foreign currency fluctuations in 2015 as compared to 2014. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $606 million, or eight percent, as compared to the prior year. This increase was due primarily to constant currency increases in net sales from our Urology and Pelvic Health business of $193 million, primarily due to the AMS Portfolio Acquisition; from our Interventional Cardiology business of $150 million; from our Peripheral Interventions business of $114 million; and from our Endoscopy business of $79 million. 40Gross Profit Our gross profit was $5.962 billion in 2016, $5.304 billion in 2015, and $5.170 billion in 2014. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased to 71.1 percent in 2016, as compared to 70.9 percent in 2015 and 70.1 percent in 2014. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period: Year EndedDecember 31, 20162015Gross profit - prior year70.9 %70.1 %Manufacturing cost reductions2.0 %1.8 %Sales pricing and mix(0.1)%(0.6)%Inventory step-up due to acquisition accounting(0.2)%(0.4)%Net impact of foreign currency(0.9)%0.5 %All other, including other inventory charges and other period expense(0.6)%(0.5)%Gross profit - current year71.1 %70.9 %The primary factor contributing to the increase in our gross profit margin for 2016, as compared to 2015, was the positive impact of cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs. Partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations and other inventory charges and period expenses. The increase in our gross profit margin for 2015, as compared to 2014, primarily resulted from manufacturing cost reductions as a result of our restructuring and other process improvement programs. Partially offsetting these factors was the net negative impact of pricing declines related primarily to sales of our drug-eluting stent and CRM products. In addition, in connection with the accounting for the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, we adjusted acquired inventory from manufacturing cost to fair value. The step-up in value is amortized through gross profit over an average estimated inventory turnover period. We recorded increased cost of $22 million in 2016 and $36 million in 2015 associated with the step-up. Operating ExpensesThe following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 % of Net % of Net % of Net(in millions) $Sales $Sales $SalesSelling, general and administrative expenses 3,09937.0% 2,87338.4% 2,90239.3%Research and development expenses 92011.0% 87611.7% 81711.1%Royalty expense 790.9% 700.9% 1111.5%Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) ExpensesIn 2016, our SG&A expenses increased $226 million, or eight percent, as compared to 2015, and were 140 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. This decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by the benefit of our targeted initiatives focused on reducing SG&A, as well as the reduction in expenses resulting from the suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax, which was substantially reinvested into our strategic growth initiatives. The Medical Device Excise Tax was temporarily suspended in December 2015 through December 31, 2017. In 2015, our SG&A expenses decreased $29 million, or one percent, as compared to 2014, and were 90 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. This decrease was driven by the impacts of our foreign currency fluctuations and declines in spending as a result of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives. We recorded $78 million in 2015 and $72 million in 2014 related to the Medical Device Excise Tax. 41Research and Development (R&D) ExpensesWe remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses. In 2016, our R&D expenses increased $44 million, or five percent, as compared to 2015, and were 70 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. In 2015, our R&D expenses increased $59 million, or seven percent, as compared to 2014, and were 60 basis points higher as a percentage of net sales. The year-over-year increase in expenses was due primarily to investments across all of our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth and increased cost related to recent acquisitions and alliances, partially offset by the favorable impact of foreign currency fluctuations.Royalty ExpenseIn 2016, our royalty expense increased $9 million, or 13 percent, as compared to 2015 and remained flat at approximately one percent of net sales for both periods. The increase in royalty expense was primarily due to increases in net sales of our drug-eluting coronary stent systems in 2016.In 2015, our royalty expense decreased $41 million, or 37 percent, as compared to 2014, and was 60 basis points lower as a percentage of net sales. The decrease relates primarily to the renegotiation of a royalty agreement in the second quarter of 2014 that resulted in a lower royalty rate structure.Amortization ExpenseOur amortization expense was $545 million in 2016, as compared to $495 million in 2015, an increase of $50 million or 10 percent. Amortization expense was $495 million in 2015, as compared to $438 million in 2014, an increase of $57 million or 13 percent. The increases in each period were primarily due to amortizable intangible assets acquired in the AMS Portfolio Acquisition on August 3, 2015.Amortization expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.Intangible Asset Impairment ChargesWe have recorded intangible asset impairment charges, including impairments of in-process research and development, of $11 million in 2016, $19 million in 2015 and $195 million in 2014. See Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for additional details related to our intangible asset impairment charges.Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates for a discussion of key assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible asset impairment testing and future events that could have a negative impact on the recoverability of our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets. Intangible asset impairment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity.Contingent Consideration ExpenseWe recorded a net expense related to the change in fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities of $29 million in 2016, a net expense of $123 million in 2015 and a net benefit of $85 million in 2014. Refer to Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details related to our contingent consideration expenses. Contingent consideration expense is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.Restructuring-related Activities and ChargesWe recorded restructuring charges pursuant to our restructuring plans of $28 million during 2016, $26 million during 2015, and $69 million during 2014. In addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of our accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $50 million during 2016, $57 million during 2015, and $48 million during 2014. Restructuring and restructuring-related costs are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.The 2016 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $175 million to $225 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $115 million to $150 million by the end of 2020 as program benefits are realized. The 422014 Restructuring Plan resulted in total pre-tax charges of $261 million and will reduce annual expenses by approximately $200 million. We expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. We made cash payments of $82 million in 2016, $95 million in 2015, and $112 million in 2014 associated with our restructuring initiatives. See Note H – Restructuring-related Activities to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our restructuring plans.Litigation-related Charges and CreditsWe recorded net litigation-related charges in the amount of $804 million in 2016, $1.105 billion in 2015, and $1.036 billion in 2014. The net charges recorded in 2016 include primarily amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims. The net charges recorded in 2015 include amounts primarily related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims and the charge related to the Mirowski Family Venture LLC (Mirowski) lawsuit following a jury verdict that Guidant Corporation (Guidant) breached their license agreement with Mirowski. The net charges recorded in 2014 include a $600 million charge related to the agreement between our subsidiary, Guidant and Johnson & Johnson signed on February 13, 2015, to settle the breach of merger agreement lawsuit brought by Johnson & Johnson, stemming from our acquisition of Guidant. In exchange, we made aggregate payments totaling $600 million to Johnson & Johnson during 2015. The 2014 net charges also include amounts related to transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and claims and certain other items. Litigation related charges and credits are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and/or our ability to comply with our debt covenants. Refer to Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional discussion of our material legal proceedings.Pension Termination Charges We recorded pension termination charges of $44 million during 2015 associated with the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan, a frozen defined benefit plan. We do not expect to incur any additional charges in the future related to the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan. The pension termination charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance.Gain on DivestitureIn January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $12 million during 2014 associated with the transaction. These divestiture-related gains are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Interest ExpenseOur interest expense was $233 million in 2016 with an average borrowing rate of 4.0 percent, as compared to $284 million in 2015, with an average borrowing rate of 5.2 percent. Interest expense in 2015 included a pre-tax charge of approximately $45 million associated with debt extinguishment charges, representing premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.000 billion of debt during the second quarter of 2015. Our interest expense was $284 million in 2015, with an average borrowing rate of 5.2 percent, as compared to $216 million in 2014, with an average borrowing rates of 4.8 percent. The increase was primarily due to the pre-tax charge of approximately $45 million associated with debt extinguishment charges, along with incremental debt to finance the AMS Portfolio Acquisition offset by savings from refinancing our senior notes.Debt extinguishment charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources, Note E – Fair Value Measurements and Note F – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations. 43Other, netOur other, net reflected expense of $37 million in 2016, expense of $39 million in 2015, and income of $8 million in 2014. The following are the components of other, net: Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201620152014Interest income $5$5$5Foreign currency losses (13)(21)(18)Net gains (losses) on investments (21)(9)27Other expense, net (8)(14)(6) $(37)$(39)$8During 2016, we recognized net losses of $21 million due to equity method adjustments on investments and investment impairments which were partially offset by a gain on our Neovasc investment. During 2015, we recognized net losses of $9 million due to equity method adjustments on investments and investment impairments. During 2014, we recognized gains of $19 million associated with the acquisition of IoGyn, Inc. related to previously held investments and other net gains related to our investment portfolio of $8 million. The acquisition-related gains from previously held investments are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. Refer to Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our strategic investments.Tax RateThe following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Year EndedDecember 31, 201620152014Reported tax rate (95.9)%63.2 %76.7 %Impact of certain receipts/charges* 108.3 %(53.5)%(64.5)% 12.4 %9.7 %12.2 %*These receipts/charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate.The change in our reported tax rate for 2016, as compared to 2015 and 2014, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate, including intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related net charges, contingent consideration, litigation-related net charges, restructuring-related net charges, pension termination charges and debt extinguishment charges, as well as the impact of certain discrete tax items.In 2016, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related net charges, litigation-related net charges and restructuring-related net charges. Our reported tax rate for 2016 was also affected by discrete items primarily related to the resolution of various uncertain tax positions through settlement or expiration of statute, offset by a charge related to changes in state apportionment.In 2015, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition-related net charges, litigation-related net charges, restructuring-related net charges, pension termination charges, and debt extinguishment charges. Our reported tax rate for 2015 was also affected by discrete items primarily related to benefits due to settlement of various uncertain tax positions and reinstatement of certain tax legislation that has been retroactively applied.In 2014, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, acquisition- and divestiture-related net charges, litigation-related net charges and restructuring-related net charges. Our reported tax rate for 2014 was also affected by discrete tax items primarily related to resolution of various uncertain tax positions resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations for assessing tax in certain jurisdictions and benefit due to change in uncertain tax positions due to a favorable court ruling, offset by a charge due to translation gain on previously taxed income.We are contesting in U.S. Tax Court significant proposed adjustments from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to its audit of our transfer pricing methodologies for the 2001 through 2007 tax years. The IRS also proposed similar transfer pricing adjustments for the 2008 through 2010 tax years. We disagree with the transfer pricing methodologies being applied by the IRS 44and we were scheduled to go to trial in the U.S. Tax Court in late July 2016. On July 19, 2016, we entered a Stipulation of Settled Issues with the IRS intended to resolve all of the aforementioned transfer pricing issues, as well as issues related to our transaction with Abbott, for the 2001 through 2007 tax years. The Stipulation of Settled Issues is contingent upon the IRS Office of Appeals (IRS Appeals) applying the same basis of settlement to all transfer pricing issues for the Company’s 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years, and if applicable, review by the United States Congress Joint Committee on Taxation. In October 2016, we reached an agreement in principle with IRS Appeals as to the resolution of the transfer pricing issues in 2008, 2009, and 2010 tax years, subject to additional calculations of tax as well as documentation to memorialize our agreement. In the event that the conditions in the Stipulation of Settled Items are satisfied, we expect to make net tax payments of approximately $275 million, plus interest through the date of payment. If finalized, payments related to the resolution are expected in the next nine to 18 months. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with these matters are adequate as of December 31, 2016 and we do not expect to recognize any additional charges related to resolution of this controversy. However, the final resolution of these issues is contingent and if the Stipulation of Settled Issues is not finalized, it could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.See Note J - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional details on our tax rate and our tax litigation.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesBased on our current business plan, we believe our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents, future cash generated from operations and access to capital markets and credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our operations, invest in our infrastructure, pay our legal-related liabilities, pay taxes due, fund possible mergers and/or acquisitions and service and repay our existing debt. Please refer to our Contractual Obligations and Commitments table for additional details on our future payment obligations and commitments.As of December 31, 2016, we had $196 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $42 million invested in money market and government funds and $154 million in short-term time deposits and interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts. We invest excess cash on hand in short-term financial instruments that earn market interest rates while mitigating principal risk through instrument and counterparty diversification, as well as what we believe to be prudent instrument selection. We limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. We also have full access to our $2.000 billion revolving credit facility and $240 million of available borrowings under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables as of December 31, 2016, both described below.The following provides a summary and description of our net cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014: Year Ended December 31,(in millions) 201620152014Cash provided by operating activities $972$600$1,269Cash used for investing activities (887)(2,186)(745)Cash provided by (used for) financing activities (206)1,322(150)Operating ActivitiesDuring 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $972 million, as compared to $600 million in 2015, an increase of $372 million or 62 percent. This increase was primarily driven by the increase in net income for 2016 compared to 2015, partially offset by approximately $100 million increase in litigation-related payments. During 2016, we made litigation-related payments primarily associated with the transvaginal surgical mesh product liability cases and to Mirowski.Refer to Note K – Commitments and Contingencies for additional information on litigation-related matters.During 2015, we generated $600 million of cash from operating activities, as compared to $1.269 billion in 2014, a decrease of $669 million, or 53 percent. This decrease was primarily due to the $600 million of payments to Johnson & Johnson. 45Investing ActivitiesDuring 2016, cash used for investing activities was $887 million. Our investing activities primarily included $408 million of payments, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions including Cosman, EndoChoice, LumenR, Distal and Neovasc; along with $376 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment and $132 million of payments related to strategic investments, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of one of two buildings located in Quincy, Massachusetts for $29 million. We intend to invest approximately $300 million in purchases of property, plant and equipment during 2017.During 2015, cash used for investing activities was $2.186 billion. Our investing activities included $1.734 billion of payments net of cash acquired, for acquisitions, including the AMS Portfolio Acquisition, CeloNova and Xlumena; along with $266 million of payments related to strategic investments, including equity investments in Preventice, Inc. and Frankenman Medical Equipment Company. Cash used for investing activities also included purchases of property, plant and equipment of $247 million. During 2014, cash used for investing activities was $745 million. Our investing activities included $486 million of payments, net of cash acquired, for acquisitions including IoGyn and the Interventional Division of Bayer AG; along with purchases of property, plant and equipment of $259 million. Financing ActivitiesOur cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, payments of acquisition-related contingent consideration, and cash used to new share settle and stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs, as discussed in Note L - Stockholders' Equity to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Additionally, our financing activities included $65 million of contingent payments in 2016, $156 million of payments in 2015 and $34 million of payments in 2014 associated with our previous acquisitions.Our liquidity plans are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Annual Report, some of which are outside our control. Macroeconomic conditions, adverse litigation outcomes and other risk and uncertainties could limit our ability to successfully execute our business plans and adversely affect our liquidity plans. DebtWe had total debt of $5.484 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $5.677 billion as of December 31, 2015 which consisted of the following:Revolving Credit FacilityIn April 2015, we entered into a new $2.000 billion revolving credit facility (the 2015 Facility) with a global syndicate of commercial banks and terminated our previous $2.000 billion revolving credit facility. The 2015 Facility matures in April 2020. There were no amounts borrowed under our current or prior revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2016 or December 31, 2015. Term LoansAs of December 31, 2016, we had an aggregate $750 million outstanding under our unsecured term loan facilities and $1.000 billion outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2015. These facilities include an unsecured term loan facility entered into in August 2013 (2013 Term Loan) which had $150 million outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and $250 million outstanding as of December 31, 2015, along with an unsecured term loan credit facility entered into in April 2015 (2015 Term Loan) which had $600 million outstanding as of December 31, 2016 and $750 million outstanding as of December 31, 2015.Our revolving credit facility and our term loan facilities require that we maintain certain financial covenants as outlined in Note F – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As of and through December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Any inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facility or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would agree to such new terms or grant such waivers. Senior NotesWe had senior notes outstanding of $4.650 billion as of December 31, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015. Our senior notes were issued in public offerings, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. Our senior notes are unsecured, unsubordinated obligations and rank on parity with each other. These notes are effectively junior to borrowings under our credit and security facility, to the extent if borrowed by our subsidiaries, and to liabilities of our subsidiaries. 46On January 12, 2017, we used our existing credit facilities to repay the $250 million plus interest of our senior notes due in January 2017.The debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2016 is as follows: (in millions)2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter TotalSenior Notes$250 $600 $— $1,450 $— $2,350 $4,650Term Loans— 225 150 375 — — 750 $250 $825 $150 $1,825 $— $2,350 $5,400Note:The table above does not include unamortized discounts associated with our senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes or debt issuance costs.Other ArrangementsWe maintained a $300 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables maturing on June 9, 2017. We had borrowings of $60 million outstanding under this facility as of December 31, 2016 and no borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2015. On February 7, 2017, we amended the terms of this credit and security facility, including increasing the facility size to $400 million. This amendment retained a similar maximum leverage ratio requirement and extended the facility maturity to February 2019.We also have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries that we account for as sales under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification® (ASC) Topic 860, Transfers and Servicing. These agreements provide for the sale of accounts receivable to third parties, without recourse, of up to approximately $391 million as of December 31, 2016. We de-recognized $152 million of receivables as of December 31, 2016 at an average interest rate of 1.8 percent, and $151 million as of December 31, 2015 at an average interest rate of 2.4 percent. In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with a commercial Japanese bank that provide for borrowings, promissory notes discounting and receivables factoring of up to 21.000 billion Japanese yen (approximately $180 million as of December 31, 2016). We de-recognized $149 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2016 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent and $132 million of notes receivable as of December 31, 2015 at an average interest rate of 1.6 percent. De-recognized accounts and notes are excluded from trade accounts receivable, net in the accompanying audited consolidated balance sheets.We had outstanding letters of credit of $44 million as of December 31, 2016 and as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees. We believe we will generate sufficient cash from operations to fund these arrangements and intend to fund these arrangements without drawing on the letters of credit,For additional details related to our debt, including our revolving credit facility, term loans, senior notes and other arrangements, see Note F – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.EquityDuring 2016 we received $111 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $114 million in 2015 and $60 million 2014. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees.We repurchased 10 million shares for $125 million during 2014. No share repurchases were made in 2016 or 2015. As of December 31, 2016, we had remaining approximately $535 million authorized under our 2013 share repurchase program. There were approximately 248 million shares in treasury as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015.Stock-based compensation expense related to our stock ownership plans was $116 million in 2016, $107 million in 2015, and $103 million in 2014. Stock-based compensation expense varies from period to period based upon, among other factors: the timing, number and fair value of awards granted during the period; forfeiture levels related to unvested awards; and employee contributions to our employee stock purchase plan. 47Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsThe following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2016. (in millions) 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 Thereafter TotalLong-term debt obligations $250 $825 $150 $1,825 $— $2,350 $5,400Interest payments (1) 224 216 194 151 111 899 1,795Lease obligations (1) 66 60 42 34 25 64 291Purchase obligations (1) 321 52 39 19 12 15 458Minimum royalty obligations (1) 1 2 1 2 1 1 8Legal reserves 1,062 — — — — — 1,062Unrecognized tax benefits (2) 577 — — — — — 577 $2,501 $1,155 $426 $2,031 $149 $3,329 $9,591(1)In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets.(2)Includes accrued interest and penalties and other related items.The amounts in the table above with respect to lease obligations represent amounts pursuant to contractual arrangements for the lease of property, plant and equipment used in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements. The table above does not include $584 million of unrecognized tax benefits and $197 million of accrued interest and penalties, and other related items because the timing of their future cash settlement is uncertain. Refer to Note J - Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits. In addition, the table above does not reflect our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable of $961 million due to the timing of payment being uncertain. Refer to Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on our legal accrual.With certain of our acquisitions, we acquired in-process research and development projects that require future funding to complete the projects. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility or completion of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We estimate that the total remaining cost to complete the in-process research and development projects we acquired is between $25 million and $50 million. Net cash inflows from the projects currently in development are expected to commence in 2017 through 2030, following the respective launches of these technologies in the U.S., Europe and Japan. Certain of our acquisitions also involve the potential payment of contingent consideration. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions and the fair value of our contingent consideration liabilities as of December 31, 2016.Legal MattersFor a discussion of our material legal proceedings see Note K – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report.Critical Accounting Policies and EstimatesOur financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas considered to be critical and require management’s 48judgment: Revenue Recognition, Bad Debt Reserves, Inventory Provisions, Valuation of Contingent Consideration Liabilities and Intangible Assets, Goodwill Valuation, Legal and Product Liability Accruals and Income Taxes.See Note A – Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information related to our accounting policies and our consideration of these critical accounting areas. In addition, see Note B – Acquisitions and Strategic Investments and Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for further discussion on the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets and contingent consideration; Note J - Income Taxes for further discussion on income tax related matters and Note K – Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion on legal and product liability matters.Revenue RecognitionWe generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates.Many of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE™ Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. For revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables, where the sale of a device is combined with a future service obligation, we defer revenue on the undelivered element and recognize this revenue over the related service period. Generally, we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of selling price available related to our future service obligations; therefore, we determine our estimates of selling price using third party evidence when available; otherwise, we use our best estimate of selling price. We allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method. The use of alternative estimates of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral.Inventory ProvisionsWe base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory.Valuation of Intangible Assets and Contingent Consideration LiabilitiesWe base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including in-process research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates or in the timing or likelihood of achieving regulatory, revenue or commercialization-based milestones. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations, amortization expense, and contingent consideration expense in current and future periods.We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. We calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets, or more frequently if change in circumstance or indicators exist. We 49assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that our indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. If we conclude that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired, we then determine the fair value of the intangible asset and perform the quantitative impairment test by comparing the fair value with the carrying value in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350). If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value.Goodwill ValuationWe allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. In 2016, we identified six operating segments including Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Rhythm Management, Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health, and Neuromodulation for purposes of identifying our reporting units. We then assessed whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We identified Rhythm Management as having two components: Cardiac Rhythm Management and Electrophysiology. For our 2016, 2015 and 2014 annual impairment assessment we identified seven reporting units, which align to our seven core businesses: Interventional Cardiology, Peripheral Interventions, Cardiac Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology, Endoscopy, Urology and Pelvic Health and Neuromodulation. For our 2016 annual impairment assessment we aggregated the Cardiac Rhythm Management and Electrophysiology reporting units, components of the Rhythm Management operating segment, based on the criteria prescribed in FASB ASC Topic 350. These reporting units were aggregated due to a reorganization that commenced in 2015 that resulted in integrated leadership, shared resources and consolidation of certain sites in 2016.In performing the goodwill impairment assessment, we utilize both the optional qualitative assessment and the two-step approach prescribed under FASB ASC Topic 350. Beginning in 2016, the qualitative assessment was used for testing certain reporting units where fair value has historically exceeded carrying value by greater than 100%. All other reporting units were tested using the two-step approach described below. The qualitative assessment requires an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount based on an assessment of relevant events including macroeconomic factors, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance and other entity-specific factors. After assessing the totality of events, if it is determined that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, the first and second steps of the goodwill impairment test are unnecessary. If it is determined that impairment is more likely than not, then we perform the first step of the two-step impairment test. In 2016, for all reporting units tested using the optional qualitative assessment, we concluded that it was not necessary to perform the first step of the two-step goodwill impairment test. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units to the fair value of these units. For our 2016, 2015 and 2014 annual impairment assessment, for those reporting units for which a quantitative test was performed, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessments. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data are available to determine the fair value of our reporting units.In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units’ future expected cash flows.If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is zero or negative, we evaluate whether 50it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists. If we determine adverse qualitative factors exist that would indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists, we then perform the second step of the goodwill test. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value.Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates.In the second quarter of 2016, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units and concluded the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Because our global Electrophysiology reporting unit was identified as being at higher risk of potential goodwill impairment during our 2015 annual test, it was tested for impairment on a stand-alone basis in the second quarter of 2016, immediately prior to aggregating it with our global Cardiac Rhythm Management reporting unit. The fair value of the stand-alone global Electrophysiology reporting unit exceeded the carrying value by approximately 36 percent. In comparison, the global Electrophysiology reporting unit had excess fair value of approximately 28 percent as of our 2015 annual test. As of the date of our 2016 annual goodwill impairment test, the aggregated global Electrophysiology and Cardiac Rhythm Management operating segment (Rhythm Management) had excess fair value over carrying value of approximately 70 percent and held $292 million of allocated goodwill. As such, it was not deemed at higher risk of future impairment. Changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses could result in future impairments of goodwill within our reporting units.Refer to Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details related to our annual goodwill impairment tests.Legal and Product Liability AccrualsIn the normal course of business, we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Litigation and product liability matters are inherently uncertain and the outcomes of individual matters are difficult to predict and quantify. As such, significant judgment is required in determining our legal and product liability accruals. Our estimates related to our legal and product liability accruals may change as additional information becomes available to us, including information related to the nature or existence of claims against us; trial court or appellate proceedings; and mediation, arbitration or settlement proceedings.Income TaxesWe provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Therefore, judgment is required based on individual facts, circumstances and information available in determining whether or not based on technical merits, the position will be sustained upon examination. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes in determining our worldwide income tax position for all years subject to audit. New Accounting PronouncementsSee Note Q - New Accounting Pronouncements to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information on Standards Implemented since December 31, 2015 and Standards to be Implemented.Additional InformationUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures by Boston ScientificTo supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and adjusted net sales that exclude the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates. These non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. 51The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income (loss) and the GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income (loss) per share. To calculate adjusted net sales that exclude sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates, we convert actual net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign currency exchange rates in the current and prior period and/or eliminate the net sales from businesses that were divested during the period. The GAAP financial measure most directly comparable to constant currency growth rate and/or growth rates excluding sales from divested business is growth rate percentages using net sales on a GAAP basis. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measure are included in the relevant sections of this Annual Report.Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to further its understanding of the performance of our operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP financial measures are consistent with those excluded from our operating segments’ measures of net sales and profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our chief operating decision maker that are used to make operating decisions and assess performance.We believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and adjusted net sales that exclude certain amounts, such as sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, in addition to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information assists our investors in understanding our operating performance and the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of these non-GAAP financial measures as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items:Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income per Share•Intangible asset impairment charges - This amount represents write-downs of certain intangible asset balances during 2016, 2015 and 2014.We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment and test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment. If we determine the carrying value of the amortizable intangible asset is not recoverable or we conclude that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-live asset is impaired, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. We exclude the impact of impairment charges from management's assessment of operating performance and from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management has excluded intangible asset impairment charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. •Acquisition- and divestiture related net charges (credits) - These adjustments may consist of (a) contingent consideration fair value adjustments; (b) gains on previously held investments; (c) purchased and/or funded in-process research and development expenses incurred outside of a business combination; (d) due diligence, other fees, inventory step-up amortization, and integration and exit costs; and (e) separation costs and gains primarily associated with the sale of our Neurovascular business in January 2011. The contingent consideration adjustments represent accounting adjustments to state contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood and amount of future contingent consideration payments. Due diligence, other fees, inventory step-up amortization, and integration and exit costs include legal, tax, severance and other expenses associated with prior and potential future acquisitions and divestitures that can be highly variable and not representative of ongoing operations. Separation costs and gains on the sale of a business unit primarily represent those associated with the Neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. •Restructuring and restructuring-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments represent severance and other direct costs associated with our restructuring plans. These restructuring plans each consist of distinct initiatives that are fundamentally different from our ongoing, core cost reduction initiatives in terms of, among other things, the frequency with which each action is performed and the required planning, resourcing, cost and timing. Examples of such initiatives include the movement of business activities, facility consolidations and closures, and the transfer of product lines 52between manufacturing facilities, which, due to the highly regulated nature of our industry, requires a significant investment in time and cost to create duplicate manufacturing lines, run product validations, and seek regulatory approvals. Restructuring initiatives generally take approximately two years to complete and have a distinct project timeline that begins subsequent to approval by our Board of Directors. In contrast to our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, restructuring initiatives typically result in duplicative cost and exit costs over this period of time, are one-time shut downs or transfers, and are not considered part of our core, ongoing operations. Because these restructuring plans are incremental to the core activities that arise in the ordinary course of our business, management excluded these costs for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. •Litigation-related net charges (credits) - These adjustments include certain significant product liability and other litigation-related charges and credits. We record these charges and credits, which we consider to be unusual or infrequent and significant, within the litigation-related charges line in our consolidated statement of operations; all other legal and product liability charges, credits and costs are recorded within selling general and administrative expenses. These amounts are excluded by management in assessing our operating performance, as well as from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. •Debt extinguishment charges - This item represents premiums, accelerated amortization of debt issuance costs and investor discount costs net of interest rate hedge gains related to the early extinguishment of $1.0 billion of senior notes during the second quarter of 2015. These adjustments are not expected to recur and do not reflect expected ongoing operating results. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. •Pension termination charges - This item represents charges associated with the termination of the Guidant Retirement Plan, a frozen defined benefit plan. These charges are not expected to recur after 2015 and do not reflect expected ongoing operating results. Accordingly, management has excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. •Amortization expense - We record intangible assets at historical cost and amortize them over their estimated useful lives. Amortization expense is excluded from management's assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from our operating segments' measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management has excluded amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. •Discrete tax items - These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions, which were initially established in prior periods in conjunction with the purchase accounting for an acquisition or as a result of intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- or litigation-related charges or credits. These adjustments do not reflect expected on-going operating results. Accordingly, management excluded these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. Adjusted Net Sales Excluding the Impact of Sales from Divested Businesses and/or Changes in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates•Sales from divested businesses are primarily associated with the Neurovascular divestiture and are not representative of ongoing operations. The impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is highly variable and difficult to predict. Accordingly, management excludes the impact of sales from divested businesses and/or changes in foreign currency exchange rates for purposes of reviewing adjusted net sales to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and a comparison to our past operating performance. Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share and adjusted net sales that exclude certain amounts, such as the sales from divested businesses and/or the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. Further, other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than we do, which may limit the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. 53Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans by Executive OfficersPeriodically, certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Exchange Act and our own Stock Trading Policy. A Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amount, prices and dates (or formulas for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including shares issued upon exercise of stock options or vesting of deferred stock units. These plans are entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non-public information about our company. We disclose details regarding individual Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans on the Investor Relations section of our website. 54Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial ReportingAs the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control–Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2016, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria.Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ Michael F. Mahoney /s/ Daniel J. Brennan Michael F. Mahoney Daniel J. Brennan President and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and ChiefFinancial Officer 55Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific CorporationWe have audited Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016 based on criteria established in Internal Control---Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission 2013 framework (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 23, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLPBoston, MassachusettsFebruary 23, 2017 56ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKWe develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions.Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $4.100 billion as of December 31, 2016 and $3.547 billion as of December 31, 2015. We recorded $199 million of other assets and $26 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2016, as compared to $237 million of other assets and $23 million of other liabilities as of December 31, 2015. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $257 million as of December 31, 2016 and $155 million as of December 31, 2015. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $223 million as of December 31, 2016 and by $189 million as of December 31, 2015. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operations.Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We have no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, $4.670 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates, representing approximately 85 percent of our total debt.See Note E – Fair Value Measurements to our 2016 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding our derivative financial instruments. 57Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting FirmThe Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific CorporationWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Boston Scientific Corporation at December 31, 2016 and 2015, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2016, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein.We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 23, 2017 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon./s/ Ernst & Young LLPBoston, MassachusettsFebruary 23, 2017 58",2023-12-30 19:42:27.665542

Research and DevelopmentOur investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth. We expended $997 million on research and development in 2017, $920 million in 2016 and $876 million in 2015. Our investment in research and development reflects the following:•internal research and development programs, regulatory design and clinical science, as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances and•engineering efforts that incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and next-generation products.We have directed our development efforts toward innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets. We are transforming how we conduct research and development and are scrutinizing our cost structure, which we believe will enable increased development activity and faster concept-to-market timelines. 8Focused, cross-functional teams take a formal approach to new product design and development, helping us to manufacture and offer innovative products in a consistently and efficiently. Involving cross-functional teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle. We believe this collaboration allows our teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies and maximize cost and time savings as we bring them to market. In addition to internal development, we work with hundreds of leading research institutions, universities and clinicians around the world to develop, evaluate and clinically test our products. We are expanding our collaborations to include research and development teams in emerging markets; these teams will focus on both global and local market requirements at a lower cost of development. We believe that these efforts will play a significant role in our future success.Marketing and SalesIn 2017, we marketed our products and solutions to approximately 36,000 hospitals, clinics, outpatient facilities and medical offices in the U.S. and in approximately125 countries worldwide. The majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations. We also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets. We expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third party distributors in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence. No single institution accounted for more than ten percent of our net sales in 2017, 2016 or 2015; however, large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales. We have a dedicated corporate accounts organization in the U.S. and Europe focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks. We consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers. Each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focused on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions, as well as on key hospital service line administrators, like the Cardiovascular Service Line Administrator. We believe that this dual focus on disease state management and hospital administrators enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with both physicians and key service line administrators. We believe that our positive working relationships with physicians, service line administrators and others in the medical industry enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to our customers' changing needs. International OperationsInternational net sales accounted for approximately 43 percent of our net sales in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Maintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Through our international presence, we seek to increase net sales and market share, leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs, accelerate the time to bring new products to market and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines. In addition, we are investing in infrastructure in emerging markets to strengthen our sales and service capabilities and maximize our opportunities in these countries.As of December 31, 2017, we had six principal international manufacturing facilities, including three in Ireland, two in Costa Rica and one in Puerto Rico. Approximately 40 percent of our products manufactured in 2017 were produced at these facilities. In the second half of 2017, we opened our regional manufacturing facility in Penang, Malaysia. We also maintain research and development capabilities in Ireland, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, Germany, India and China. We operate physician training centers in France, Japan, South Africa, Germany, Italy, South Korea, Poland, India and China.Manufacturing and Raw MaterialsWe are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization. We strive to improve the efficiency of our sourcing operations and to leverage the technical expertise of the broader market by partnering with strategic suppliers. In doing so, we seek to focus our internal resources on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products. We continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs. We also drive continuous improvement in product quality through process controls and validations, supplier and distribution controls and providing our operations teams with the necessary training and tools. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to enhance our operational effectiveness by identifying cost-improvement opportunities. 9We remain committed to maintaining prudent investments in supply chain resiliency on an ongoing basis. Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing and distribution capabilities and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions that we may encounter. Many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We also have an on-going program to identify single-source components and to develop alternative back-up supplies and we regularly readdress the adequacy and abilities of our suppliers to meet our needs. As an example, our past investments in supply chain risk reduction led to minimal production impact in the wake of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria in 2017. Quality AssuranceWe are committed to providing high quality products to our customers. Our quality system starts with the initial product specification and continues through the design of the product, component specification process and the manufacturing, sale and servicing of the product. Our quality system is intended to build in quality and process control and to utilize continuous improvement concepts throughout the product life. These systems are designed to enable us to satisfy various international quality system regulations, including those of the FDA with respect to products sold in the U.S. All of our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers are certified under the ISO 13485 quality system standard, established by the International Standards Organization (ISO) for medical devices, which includes requirements for an implemented quality system that applies to component quality, supplier control, product design and manufacturing operations. This certification can be obtained only after a complete audit of a company’s quality system by an independent outside auditor. Maintenance of the certification requires that these facilities undergo periodic re-examination.Environmental Regulation and ManagementWe are subject to various environmental laws, directives and regulations both in the U.S. and abroad. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe that sound environmental, health and safety performance contributes to our competitive strength while benefiting our customers, stockholders and employees. We are focused on continuous improvement in these areas by reducing pollution, depletion of natural resources and our overall environmental footprint. Specifically, we are working to optimize energy and resource usage, ultimately reducing greenhouse gas emissions and waste. We are listed on the FTSE4Good Corporate Social Responsibility Index, managed by the Financial Times and the London Stock Exchange, which measures the performance of companies that meet globally recognized standards of corporate responsibility. This listing recognizes our dedication to those standards and it places us in a select group of companies with a demonstrated commitment to responsible business practices and sound environmental policies.We have obtained ISO 14001:2015 certifications at our major manufacturing plants and Tier 1 distribution centers around the world, as well as our Corporate headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts. ISO 14001:2015 is a globally recognized standard for Environmental Management Systems, established by the International Standards Organization, which provides a voluntary framework to identify key environmental aspects associated with our business. Using this environmental management system and the specific attributes of our certified locations in the U.S., Ireland, Costa Rica and the Netherlands, we continue to improve our environmental performance and reduce our environmental footprint.CompetitionWe encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products and solutions, some from companies that may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic plc and Cook Medical, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, such as pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states that could also be treated using our products.We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both clinical and economic outcomes for our customers while also continuing to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures safely and effectively in a less-invasive manner. We also compete on, ease of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current environment of managed care, with economically-motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive 10pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and addressable market sizes. We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to: •offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes,•create or acquire innovative, scientifically advanced technologies,•apply our technology and solutions cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets,•develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions,•attract and retain skilled personnel, •obtain patent or other protection for our products,•obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals,•continually enhance our quality systems, •manufacture and successfully market our products and solutions either directly or through outside parties and •supply sufficient inventory to meet customer demand.Medical Device Regulatory ApprovalsThe medical devices that we manufacture and market are subject to regulation by numerous worldwide regulatory bodies, including the FDA and comparable international regulatory agencies. These agencies require manufacturers of medical devices to comply with applicable laws and regulations governing development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution. Medical devices are also generally subject to varying levels of regulatory control based on risk level of the device. In the U.S., authorization to distribute a new device can generally be met in one of three ways. The first process requires that a premarket notification (510(k)) be made to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is as safe and effective as, or substantially equivalent to, a legally marketed device (the “predicate” device). Applicants must submit performance data to establish substantial equivalence. In some instances, data from human clinical trials must also be submitted in support of a 510(k) premarket notification. If so, these data must be collected in a manner that conforms to the applicable IDE regulations. The FDA must issue a decision finding substantial equivalence before commercial distribution can occur. Changes to cleared devices that could not significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device can generally be made without additional 510(k) premarket notifications; otherwise, a new 510(k) is required.The second process requires the submission of a premarket approval (PMA) application to the FDA to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective for its intended use. This approval process applies to most Class III devices and generally requires clinical data to support the safety and effectiveness of the device, obtained in adherence with IDE requirements. The FDA will approve the PMA application if it finds that there is a reasonable assurance that the device is safe and effective for its intended purpose and that the proposed manufacturing is in compliance with the Quality System Regulation (QSR). For novel technologies, the FDA will generally seek input from an advisory panel of medical experts and seek their views on the safety, effectiveness and benefit-risk of the device. The PMA process is generally more detailed, lengthier and more expensive than the 510(k) process.The third process requires that an application for a Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) be made to the FDA for the use of a Humanitarian Use Device (HUD). An HUD is intended to benefit patients by treating or diagnosing a disease or condition that affects, or is manifested in, not more than 8,000 individuals in the U.S. per year. The application submitted to the FDA for an HDE is similar in both form and content to a PMA application, but is exempt from the effectiveness requirements of a PMA. The HUD provision of the regulation provides an incentive for the development of devices for use in the treatment or diagnosis of diseases affecting smaller patient populations.In the European Economic Area (EEA), we are required to comply with applicable Medical Device Directives, specifically the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Device Directive and affix a CE Mark on medical devices that will be placed on the market within the EEA. The CE Mark is affixed following conformity assessment and either approval from the appointed independent Notified Body or through self-certification. CE Marking indicates conformity to the applicable Essential Requirements of the relevant Medical Devices Directive. The European Union (EU) Commission published a new Medical Device Regulation in 2017, which repealed the existing Directives and provides a three year transition period. The Medical Device Regulation will change multiple aspects of the existing regulatory framework, such as clinical evidence requirements and introduce several new requirements, such as Unique Device Identification (UDI). Thus, the new Medical Device Regulation significantly modifies and intensifies the compliance burden for industry.We are also required to comply with the regulations of every other country where we commercialize products before we can launch new products, such as the requirement that we obtain approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) and the China Food and Drug Administration. Many countries that previously did not have medical device regulations, 11or minimal regulations, are now introducing them. For example, India is in the process of implementing new medical device regulations.The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies and competent authorities actively monitor compliance to local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, record keeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order repair, replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Safe Medical Devices Act pertaining to medical devices or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Regulatory agencies and authorities in the countries where we do business can halt production in or distribution within their respective country or otherwise take action in accordance with local laws and regulations.International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. Exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be recertified on a regular basis, generally every five years. The recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and, where needed, conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where recertification applications are required, they must be approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries.Government AffairsWe maintain a global Government Affairs presence, headquartered in Washington, D.C., to actively monitor and advocate on a myriad legislation and policies impacting us, both on a domestic and an international front. The Government Affairs office works closely with members of Congress and committee staff, the White House and Administration offices, state legislatures and regulatory agencies, embassies and global governments on issues affecting our business. Our proactive approach and depth of political and policy expertise are aimed at having our positions heard by federal, state and global decision-makers, to advance our business objectives by educating policymakers on our positions, key priorities and the value of our technologies. The Government Affairs office also manages our political action committee and works closely with trade groups on issues affecting our industry and healthcare in general.Healthcare Policies and ReimbursementPolitical, economic and regulatory influences around the world continue to subject the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives related to limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness reviews of therapies, technology assessments and health care delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers and other stakeholders may be significant and new therapies may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption.The impact to our business of the U.S. Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act's (ACA) provisions related to coverage expansion, payment reforms and delivery system has been immaterial. The ACA and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. The legislation imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. In December 2015, the Promise for Antibiotics and Therapeutics for Health Act, or PATH Act, was passed, which included legislation which temporarily suspended the 2.3 percent excise tax until December 31, 2017. In January 2018 another temporary two year suspension of the 2.3 percent excise tax was passed, extending the suspension to December 31, 2019. We have substantially reinvested the amounts we would have expended on this tax into jobs, innovation, research and development, collaborations with universities and other initiatives that will help treat patients and drive revenue growth.The U.S. Federal government, as part of the ACA and certain state governments have enacted laws aimed at increasing transparency, or ""sunshine,"" in relationships between medical device, biologics and pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals 12(HCPs). As a result, we are required by law to report many types of payments and transfers of value provided to HCPs. Certain foreign jurisdictions are currently acting to implement similar laws. Failure to comply with sunshine laws and/or implement and adhere to adequate policies and practices to address changes to legal and regulatory requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations.As noted below, we expect certain trends to continue placing pressure on pricing in the U.S. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts (TCJA), enacted December 22, 2017 in the U.S., makes changes to the tax treatment of health care expenses and repealed the “individual mandate” to purchase private insurance. These tax law changes may result in changes to insurance coverage and financing of insurance coverage in individual markets. Additional legislation may result in changes to government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and federal sunshine laws. In addition, the current U.S. Administration is considering a number of administrative policy changes that will likely result in additional changes to insurance coverage, financing of insurance coverage and benefits offered through private insurance in both the employer-sponsored and individual markets. At this point, the impact of potential legislative and administrative changes is unclear because specific changes have not been implemented. Additionally, while the implementation of the medical device tax has further been suspended until December 31, 2019, the status of the tax for sales after December 31, 2019 is not clear. The medical device tax may continue to be suspended, or may be reinstated at the same or at a different level effective January 1, 2020. We expect that pricing of medical devices will remain under pressure as alternative payment reform such as prospective payment systems for hospital care, preferential site of service payments, value-based purchasing and accountable care organizations (ACOs) continue to take shape globally. We also expect marketplace changes to place pressure on medical device pricing globally as hospitals consolidate and large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other groups continue to seek to aggregate purchasing power. Similarly, governments are increasing the use of tenders, placing pressure on medical device pricing. Some governments also seek to limit the growth of healthcare costs through price regulation. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as the U.S., Japan and Europe and other markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products, which in turn may influence a hospital’s or physician's selection of products used to treat patients.Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including government programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the U.S.) and private insurance payers, for the services provided to their patients. Third-party payers and governments may approve or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Coverage decisions by payers for these technologies and associated procedures are based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value of the technologies and associated procedures.Proprietary Rights and Patent LitigationWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and non-disclosure agreements to protect our intellectual property. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and foreign countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2017, we held more than 19,000 patents and had approximately 6,000 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license, except for those relating to our drug-eluting coronary stent systems, is material in relation to our business as a whole.We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties. We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. See Note J – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2017 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of intellectual property, product liability and other litigation and proceedings in which we are involved. 13EmployeesAs of December 31, 2017, we had approximately 29,000 employees, including approximately 14,000 in operations, 9,000 in selling, marketing and distribution, 4,000 in clinical, regulatory and research and development and 4,000 in administration. Of these employees, we employed approximately 15,000 outside the U.S., approximately 8,000 of whom are in the manufacturing operations function.Community OutreachWe envision what is possible for communities around the world by giving our time and resources to positively impact the lives of others. Guided by our core value of caring, we seek to improve access to healthcare, invest in educational programming for students with limited means and access to opportunities, and support and embrace the spirit of voluntarism within our global workforce, while adhering to strong ethical standards. We are also driven to minimize our impact on the environment, demonstrated by our new commitment to carbon neutrality. Our goal is to achieve a zero carbon footprint in manufacturing operations for all of our products by 2030.In some parts of the world, access to health information, screening, care and services can be limited. In 2017, we partnered with Project HOPE (Health Opportunities for People Everywhere) and Partners in Health to increase the number of healthcare workers in South Africa, India and Mexico. By increasing the number and proficiency of community healthcare workers, we can impact health outcomes for people today and into the future. In 2017 for example, our global health grants enabled 10 new physicians to be recruited, trained and relocated to Mexico's Chiapas Region. In India, more than 600 community health workers were trained on how to screen and identify diabetes and hypertension, resulting in nearly 12,000 people screened across India. Additionally, more than 100 community health workers were trained on screening protocols for chronic diseases within two districts in South Africa.We are also inspired by young learners who share our passion for innovation and problem solving. Our employees also work with students around the world and share their passion for Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) through participation in more than 200 STEM events and school programs. Beyond the classroom, our employees provided more than 42,000 hours of community service to make a positive impact at more than 530 global community events in 33 countries.Supporting five communities where we have a significant business presence, the Boston Scientific Foundation mission is simple: to help expand access to quality health care and educational opportunities for underserved populations. The Boston Scientific Foundation awarded nearly a million dollars in grant awards to more than 67 nonprofit organizations across the U.S. in 2017. With more than 70 employee volunteers who evaluate proposals for the Boston Scientific Foundation Board review and approval, the Boston Scientific Foundation was able fuel innovative solutions to improve access to quality healthcare and create new opportunities for students to learn and achieve.SeasonalityOur net sales are influenced by many factors, including product launches, acquisitions, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, patient, physician and employee holiday schedules and other macro-economic conditions. While, our net sales do not reflect any significant degree of seasonality, customer purchases have historically been lower in the first and third quarters of the year.

RISK FACTORSIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report and the exhibits hereto, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks. This section contains forward-looking statements. You should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements set forth at the end of Item 1. Business of this Annual Report. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.We face intense competition and may not be able to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the medical devices industry, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The medical device markets in which we primarily participate are highly competitive. We encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which our products are sold from various medical device companies, some of which may have greater financial and marketing resources than we do, including as a result of consolidation among our competitors in the healthcare industry. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic plc and Cook Medical, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or which participate in only a specific market segment. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, including pharmaceutical companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states intended to be treated using our products.Additionally, the medical device markets in which we primarily participate are characterized by extensive research and development and rapid technological change. Developments by other companies of new or improved products, processes or technologies may make our products or proposed products obsolete or less competitive and may negatively impact our net sales. We are required to devote continued efforts and financial resources to develop or acquire scientifically advanced technologies and products, apply our technologies cost-effectively across product lines and markets, obtain patent and other protection for our technologies and products, obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals and successfully manufacture and market our products consistent with our quality standards. If we fail to develop or acquire new products or enhance existing products, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a delay in the timing of the launch of next-generation products and the overall performance of, and continued physician confidence in, those products may result in declines in our market share and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.We may experience declines in market size, average selling prices for our products, medical procedure volumes, and our share of the markets in which we compete, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We continue to experience pressures across many of our businesses due to competitive activity, increased market power of our customers as the healthcare industry consolidates, economic pressures experienced by our customers and the impact of managed care organizations and other third-party payers. These and other factors may adversely impact market sizes, as well as our share of the markets in which we compete, the average selling prices for our products or medical procedure volumes. There can be no assurance that the size of the markets in which we compete will increase above existing levels, that we will be able to regain or gain market share or compete effectively on the basis of price or that the number of procedures in which our products are used will increase above existing levels. Decreases in market sizes or our market share and declines in average selling prices or procedural volumes could materially adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.Continued consolidation in the healthcare industry or additional governmental controls exerted over pricing in key marketscould lead to increased demands for price concessions or limit or eliminate our ability to sell to certain of our significant market segments, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Numerous initiatives and reforms by legislators, regulators and third-party payers to curb the rising cost of healthcare have catalyzed a consolidation of aggregate purchasing power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services is expected to continue to intensify, resulting in pricing pressures, decreased average selling prices and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, government contracting requirements, and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may increase competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and services and may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. 18Healthcare cost containment pressures, government payment and delivery system reforms, changes in private payer policies, and marketplace consolidations could decrease the demand for our products, the prices which customers are willing to pay for those products and/or the number of procedures performed using our devices, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers around the world that typically bill various third-party payers, including government programs, authorities or agencies (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid in the United States) and private health plans, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. Governments and payers may also institute changes in health care delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of health care costs. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for their products and services from private and governmental third-party payers is critical to the success of medical technology companies because it affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement and funding vary by country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products and technologies and the use of established products and technologies. Even if we develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payers. Further legislative or administrative reforms to the reimbursement systems in the U.S., Japan, or other countries in a manner that significantly reduces reimbursement for procedures using our medical devices or denies coverage for those procedures, including price regulation, competitive bidding and tendering, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, heightened clinical data requirements, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operationsWe are subject to a number of market, business, financial, legal and regulatory risks and uncertainties with respect to our international operations that could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. International net sales accounted for approximately 43 percent of our global net sales in 2017, with sales from emerging markets accounting for approximately 10 percent. An important part of our strategy is to continue pursuing growth opportunities in net sales and market share outside of the U.S. by expanding global presence, including in emerging markets. Our international operations are subject to a number of market, business and financial risks and uncertainties, including those related to political and economic instability, foreign currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations, competitive product offerings, local changes in health care financing and payment systems and health care delivery systems, local product preferences and requirements, including preferences for local manufacturers; workforce instability, less intellectual property protection in certain countries than exists in the U.S. and, in certain foreign countries, longer accounts receivable cycles. Such risks and uncertainties may adversely impact our ability to implement our growth strategy in these markets and, as a result, our sales growth, market share and operating profits from our international operations may be adversely affected. Our international operations are subject to established and developing legal and regulatory requirements for medical devices in each country in which our products are marketed and sold. Most foreign countries have medical device regulations. Further, most countries outside of the U.S. require product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis in order to continue to be marketed and sold there. In addition, several countries that previously did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded, or plan to expand, on existing regulations, including requiring local clinical data in addition to global clinical data. These factors have caused or may cause us to experience more uncertainty, risk, expense and delay in commercializing products in certain foreign jurisdictions, which could affect our ability to obtain approvals for our products in those jurisdictions and adversely impact our net sales, market share and operating profits from our international operations.Further, international markets are affected by economic pressure to contain healthcare costs, which can lead to more rigorous evidence requirements and lower reimbursement rates for either our products directly or procedures in which our products are used. Governments and payers may also institute changes in health care delivery systems that may reduce funding for services or encourage greater scrutiny of health care costs. In addition, certain international markets may also be affected by foreign government efforts to reference reimbursement rates in other countries. All of these types of changes may ultimately reduce selling prices of our products and/or reduce the number of procedures in which our products are used, which may adversely impact our net sales, market share and operating profits from our international operations.In addition, our international operations are subject to other established and developing U.S. and foreign legal and regulatory requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and/or similar laws in other countries and U.S. and foreign import and export controls and licensing requirements, trade protection and embargo measures and customs laws. Global businesses, including those in the medical device industry, are facing increasing scrutiny of, and heightened enforcement efforts with respect to, their international operations. Any alleged or actual failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements may subject us to government scrutiny, civil and/or criminal proceedings, sanctions and other liabilities, which may have a material adverse effect on our international operations, financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity. 19In a referendum on June 23, 2016, voters approved for the United Kingdom (UK) to exit the EU. As it stands, the UK will depart the European Union (EU) on March 30, 2019 but the terms of its withdrawal and the nature of its future relationship with the EU are still being decided. Future exit of the UK from the EU will have numerous consequences in all areas of the business, including, economic, regulatory, operational, and the actual impact depends on the ultimate deal reached and is very difficult to assess at this time. Changes in the industry regulations could have an effect on existing CE certificates being renewed and new certificates being issued which would impact the ability to trade; however it is impossible to assess the full impact at this stage.In December of 2017, EU leaders announced an agreement to begin the next phase of negotiations, with talks on a transition period after March 2019 to begin in early 2018 and discussions on the future UK-EU relationship, including trade and security, to begin in March. At this stage, the materiality to us of the Brexit risk factor remains unknown and unquantifiable. Any significant changes in the political and economic, financial, competitive, legal and regulatory or reimbursement conditions where we conduct, or plan to expand, our international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to manage our debt levels, maintain investment grade credit ratings at the three ratings agencies, or experience a disruption in our cash flows it could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing, financial condition or results of operations.As part of our strategy to maximize stockholder value, we use financial leverage to reduce our cost of capital. Our outstanding debt balance was $5.616 billion as of December 31, 2017 and $5.484 billion as of December 31, 2016. Although we currently have investment grade ratings at Moody's Investor Service, Standard & Poor's Rating Service and Fitch Ratings, our inability to maintain investment grade credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing funds in the future and reduce our access to liquidity. Delays in our product development and new product launches could result in disruption in our cash flow or our ability to continue to effectively manage our debt levels could have an adverse effect on our cost of borrowing, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our credit and security facilities contain covenants that require us to maintain specified financial ratios and place other limits on our business. If we are unable to satisfy these covenants, we may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders and no assurance can be made that our lenders would grant such waivers on favorable terms or at all and we could be required to repay any borrowings on demand.We may record future goodwill impairment charges or other intangible asset impairment charges related to one or more of our global reporting units, which could materially adversely impact our results of operations.We test our goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and, in evaluating the potential for impairment of goodwill, we make assumptions regarding estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates. In the second quarter of 2017, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. Therefore, it was not necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates within our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this Annual Report for a discussion of key assumptions used in our testing.On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value to detect events or other changes that would warrant an interim impairment test of our goodwill and intangible assets. Relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of a reporting unit or asset group, changes in our reporting units or in the structure of our business as a result of future reorganizations, acquisitions or divestitures of assets or businesses, or small changes in other key assumptions, may result in the recognition of significant asset impairment charges, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.Failure to integrate acquired businesses into our operations successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.As part of our strategy to realign our business portfolio, we completed several acquisitions in 2017, 2016 and 2015 and may pursue additional acquisitions in the future. Our integration of acquired businesses requires significant efforts, including corporate restructuring, the coordination of information technologies, research and development, sales and marketing, operations, regulatory, supply chain, manufacturing, quality systems and finance. These efforts result in additional expenses and involve significant management time. Some of the factors that could affect the success of our acquisitions include, among others, the effectiveness of our due diligence process, our ability to execute our business plan for the acquired companies, the strength of the acquired technology, results of clinical trials, regulatory approvals and reimbursement levels of the acquired products and related procedures, 20the continued performance of critical transition services, our ability to adequately fund acquired in-process research and development projects and retain key employees and our ability to achieve synergies with our acquired companies, such as increasing sales of our products, achieving cost savings and effectively combining technologies to develop new products. In addition, foreign acquisitions involve unique risks, including those related to integration of operations across different geographies, cultures and languages, currency risks, and risks associated with the economic, political, legal and regulatory environment in specific countries. Our failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business and our future growth. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become profitable or remain so, and if our acquisitions are not successful, we may record related asset impairment charges in the future or experience other negative consequences on our results.We may not be successful in our strategy relating to future strategic acquisitions of, investments in, or alliances with, other companies and businesses, which have been a significant source of historical growth for us, and will be key to our diversification into new markets and technologies.Our strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances are intended to further expand our ability to offer customers effective, high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. These acquisitions, investments and alliances have been a significant source of our growth. If we are unsuccessful in our acquisitions, investments and alliances, we may be unable to grow our business. The success of our strategy relating to future acquisitions, investments or alliances will depend on a number of factors, including:•our ability to identify suitable opportunities for acquisition, investment or alliance, if at all,•our ability to manage acquisition, investment, or alliance opportunities within our capital capacity and prioritize those investments to execute on our strategy, •the ability of our due diligence process to uncover potential issues with target companies,•our ability to finance any future acquisition, investment or alliance on terms acceptable to us, if at all,•whether we are able to complete acquisitions, investments or alliances in a timely manner on terms that are satisfactory to us, if at all, •our ability to successfully integrate and operate acquired businesses,•our ability to successfully identify and retain key target employees,•our ability to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including foreign laws and regulations and•intellectual property and litigation related to newly acquired technologies. Any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing, depending on their size or nature.We may not realize the expected benefits from our restructuring and optimization initiatives, our long-term expense reduction programs may result in an increase in short-term expense and our efforts may lead to unintended consequences. We monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry and the markets in which we compete and assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency and to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make investments in research and development projects, capital and our people that we believe are important to our long-term success. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken restructuring and optimization initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. For example, in June 2016, we announced a restructuring initiative (the 2016 Restructuring Plan) intended to develop global commercialization, technology and manufacturing capabilities in key growth markets, build on our Plant Network Optimization (PNO) strategy which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and expand operational efficiencies in support of our operating income margin goals. Key activities under the 2016 Restructuring Plan include strengthening global infrastructure through evolving global real estate assets and workplaces, developing global commercial and technical competencies, enhancing manufacturing and distribution expertise in certain regions and continuing implementation of our PNO strategy. Activities under the plan were initiated in the second quarter of 2016 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2018. We revised the original estimate for the costs and savings associated with the program in the first quarter of 2018, as approved by the Board of Directors. The 2016 Restructuring Plan is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $275 million to $325 million and reduce gross annual expenses by approximately $165 million to $175 million by the end of 2020 as program benefits are realized. We expect a substantial portion of the savings to be reinvested in strategic growth initiatives. Expense reduction initiatives under the plan include various cost and efficiency improvement measures, which may include movement of business activities, facility consolidations and closures and the transfer of product lines between manufacturing facilities, which, due to the highly regulated nature of our industry, requires a significant investment in time and cost to create duplicate manufacturing lines, run product validations and seek regulatory approvals. These measures could yield unintended consequences, such as distraction of our management and employees, business disruption, inability to attract or retain key personnel and reduced employee productivity, which could negatively affect our business, sales, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our restructuring and 21optimization initiatives result in charges and expenses that impact our operating results. We cannot guarantee that the activities under the 2016 Restructuring Plan or other optimization initiatives will result in the desired efficiencies and estimated cost savings.Current domestic and international economic conditions could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations. Uncertainty about global economic conditions, including as a result of credit and sovereign debt issues, has caused and may continue to cause disruption in the financial markets, including diminished liquidity and credit availability. These conditions may adversely affect our suppliers, leading them to experience financial difficulties or to be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which could cause disruptions in our ability to produce our products. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products, particularly capital equipment, or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, we have accounts receivable factoring programs in certain European countries. Continued deterioration of the global economy or increase in sovereign debt issues may impact our ability to transfer receivables to third parties in certain of those countries in the future. Third parties such as banks offering factoring programs in these countries are looking to reduce their exposure levels to government owned or supported debt. This could result in terminations of, or changes to the costs or credit limits of our existing factoring programs. Such terminations or changes could have a negative impact on our cash flow and days sales outstanding.The strength and timing of economic recovery remains uncertain and there can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy. Accordingly, we cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions, including sovereign debt issues and increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the U.S. and abroad, may continue to negatively impact our average selling prices, net sales and profit margins, procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payers. In addition, conditions in the financial markets and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our ability to borrow money in the credit markets, access the capital markets and to obtain financing for acquisitions or other general corporate and commercial purposes.Healthcare policy changes, including healthcare reform legislation, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.Political, economic and policy influences are leading the healthcare industry to make substantial structural and financial changes that will continue affecting our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives limiting the growth of healthcare costs (including price regulation), coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and healthcare delivery structure reforms, are continuing in many countries where we do business. We believe that these changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more treatments that can reduce costs, improve efficiencies and/or increase patient access. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary and evidence necessary to demonstrate value to our customers, patients, payers and other stakeholders may be significant and it may take a longer period of time to gain widespread adoption. Moreover, there can be no assurance that our strategies will succeed for every product.The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 were enacted into law in the U.S. in March 2010. As a U.S. headquartered company with significant domestic sales, the medical device tax included in this law has materially affected us. The law imposed on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in January 2013. Under the current administration, there may be a permanent repeal or an alteration of some or all elements of the ACA, but at this time it is not definite that a change will be enacted or what new healthcare provisions may be implemented. While the implementation of the medical device tax has been suspended until December 31, 2019, the status of the tax for sales after December 31, 2019 is not clear. The tax may continue to be suspended, or may be reinstated at the same or at a different level effective January 1, 2020. Other provisions of this law, including comparative effectiveness research, pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies and other changes to the payment systems, have started changing the way healthcare is delivered, reimbursed and funded. While the extent to which it has affected our business is not clear, these changes, over the long-term, may adversely affect our business and results of operations.We cannot predict the specific healthcare programs and regulations that will be ultimately implemented by regional and national governments globally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for either our products and/or procedures using our products reduce medical procedure volumes and/or increase cost containment pressures on us or others in the healthcare sector could adversely affect our business and results of operations. 22We are subject to extensive and dynamic medical device regulation, which may impede or hinder the approval or sale of our products and, in some cases, may ultimately result in an inability to obtain approval of certain products or may result in the recall or seizure of previously approved products. Our products, marketing, sales and development activities and manufacturing processes are subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDC Act), by comparable agencies in foreign countries and by other regulatory agencies and governing bodies. Under the FDC Act, medical devices must receive FDA clearance or approval or an exemption from such clearance or approval before they can be commercially marketed in the U.S. In the EU, we are required to comply with applicable medical device directives (including the Medical Devices Directive and the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive) and obtain CE Mark certification in order to market medical devices. The CE Mark is applied following approval from an independent notified body or declaration of conformity. The process of obtaining marketing approval or clearance from the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries for new products, or with respect to enhancements or modifications to existing products, could:•take a significant period of time,•require the expenditure of substantial resources,•involve rigorous pre-clinical and clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance,•require changes to products and•result in limitations on the indicated uses of products. In addition, exported devices are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country to which the device is exported. Some countries do not have medical device regulations, but in most foreign countries, medical devices are regulated. Frequently, regulatory approval may first be obtained in a foreign country prior to application in the U.S. due to differing regulatory requirements; however, other countries, such as China for example, require approval in the country of origin or legal manufacturer first. Most countries outside of the U.S. require that product approvals be renewed or recertified on a regular basis, generally every four to five years. The renewal or recertification process requires that we evaluate any device changes and any new regulations or standards relevant to the device and conduct appropriate testing to document continued compliance. Where renewal or recertification applications are required, they may need to be renewed and/or approved in order to continue selling our products in those countries. There can be no assurance that we will receive the required approvals for new products or modifications to existing products on a timely basis or that any approval will not be subsequently withdrawn or conditioned upon extensive post-market study requirements.Our global regulatory environment is becoming increasingly stringent and unpredictable, which could increase the time, cost and complexity of obtaining regulatory approvals for our products, as well as the clinical and regulatory costs of supporting those approvals. Several countries that did not have regulatory requirements for medical devices have established such requirements in recent years and other countries have expanded on existing regulations. Certain regulators are exhibiting less flexibility and are requiring local preclinical and clinical data in addition to global data. While harmonization of global regulations has been pursued, requirements continue to differ significantly among countries. We expect this global regulatory environment will continue to evolve, which could impact our ability to obtain future approvals for our products, or could increase the cost and time to obtain such approvals in the future. The European Union regulatory bodies finalized a new Medical Device Regulation (MDR) in 2017, which replaced the existing Directives and provided three years for transition and compliance. The MDR will change several aspects of the existing regulatory framework, such as clinical data requirements and introduce new ones, such as Unique Device Identification (UDI). We and the Notified Bodies who will oversee compliance to the new MDR face uncertainties as the MDR is rolled out and enforced by the Commission and EEA Competent Authorities, creating risks in several areas, including the CE Marking process and data transparency, in the upcoming years.The FDA and other worldwide regulatory agencies actively monitor compliance with local laws and regulations through review and inspection of design and manufacturing practices, recordkeeping, reporting of adverse events, labeling and promotional practices. The FDA can ban certain medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order repair, replacement or refund of these devices and require notification of health professionals and others with regard to medical devices that present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA can take action against a company that promotes ""off-label"" uses. The FDA may also enjoin and restrain a company for certain violations of the FDC Act and other amending Acts pertaining to medical devices, or initiate action for criminal prosecution of such violations. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict a company from effectively marketing and selling its products, may limit a company's ability to obtain future premarket clearances or approvals and could results in a substantial modification to our business practices and operations. International sales of medical devices manufactured in the U.S. that are not approved by the FDA for use in the U.S., or that are banned or deviate from lawful performance standards, are subject to FDA export requirements. 23Regulations regarding the development, manufacture and sale of medical devices are evolving and subject to future change. We cannot predict what impact, if any, those changes might have on our business. Failure to comply with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or manufacturer could result in fines, delays or suspensions of regulatory clearances or approvals, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, operating restrictions and/or criminal prosecution. We may also initiate field actions as a result of a failure to strictly comply with our internal quality policies. The failure to receive product approval clearance on a timely basis, suspensions of regulatory clearances, seizures or recalls of products, physician advisories or other field actions, or the withdrawal of product approval by the FDA or by comparable agencies in foreign countries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Our products are continually subject to clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or other third parties, the results of which may be unexpected, or perceived as unfavorable by the market, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.As a part of the regulatory process of obtaining marketing clearance for new products and new indications for existing products, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unexpected or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the FDA's or the market's perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our ability to obtain product approvals, our position in, and share of, the markets in which we participate and our business, financial condition, results of operations or future prospects.Our future growth is dependent upon the development of new products and enhancement of existing products, which requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals, all of which may be very expensive and time-consuming and may not result in commercially viable products.In order to develop new products and enhance existing products, we focus our research and development programs largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and businesses. The development of new products and enhancement of existing products requires significant investment in research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. The results of our product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to anticipate customer needs, innovate and develop new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the United States and abroad, manufacture products in a cost-effective manner, obtain appropriate intellectual property protection for our products and gain and maintain market approval of our products. There can be no assurance that any products now in development or that we may seek to develop in the future will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. If we are unable to develop and launch new products and enhanced products, our ability to maintain or expand our market position in the markets in which we participate may be materially adversely impacted. Further, we are continuing to investigate and have completed several acquisitions that involve opportunities to further expand our presence in and diversify into, priority growth areas by accessing new products and technologies. There can be no assurance that our investments will be successful or we will be able to access new products and technologies on terms favorable to us, or that these products and technologies will achieve commercial feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of new products and technologies or our decision to reduce our investments may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth.Additionally, certain products or groups of products, in particular new products or enhancements of existing products, may have a disproportionate impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Failure to meet growth projections, poor clinical outcomes, increasing regulatory requirements, launch delays and inability to effectively scale manufacturing and achieve targeted margins with respect to any of these products or groups of products in particular may materially adversely impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.The medical device industry and its customers continue to face scrutiny and regulation by governmental authorities and are often the subject of numerous investigations, often involving marketing and other business practices or product quality issues including device recalls or advisories. These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings; imposition of substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, including corporate integrity agreements, stipulated judgments or exclusion; diversion of our employees and management's attention; imposition of administrative costs and have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity; and may lead to greater governmental regulation in the future. The medical devices we design, develop, manufacture and market are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and numerous other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. These authorities continue to highly scrutinize our industry. We have received and in the future may receive, subpoenas and other requests for information from Congress and other state and federal governmental agencies, including, among others, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Office of Inspector General of the 24Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Department of Defense, as well as from foreign governments and agencies. The requests and/or subpoenas we have received relate primarily to financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance and sale and/or product promotional practices. We have cooperated with these subpoenas and other requests for information and expect to continue to do so in the future. We cannot predict when a matter will be resolved, the outcome of the matter or its impact on us and cooperation may involve significant costs, including document production costs. An adverse outcome in any matter could include the commencement of an investigation, civil and criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, including exclusion from government reimbursement programs, entry into Corporate Integrity Agreements (CIAs) with governmental agencies and amendments to any existing CIAs. In addition, resolution of any matter could involve the imposition of additional and costly compliance obligations. For example, in 2009, we entered into a civil settlement with the DOJ regarding the DOJ's investigation relating to certain post-market surveys conducted by Guidant Corporation before we acquired Guidant in 2006. As part of the settlement, we entered into a 5-year CIA with the Office of Inspector General for HHS, which required various provisions, including enhancements to certain compliance procedures related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers. Cooperation with requests and investigations from external agencies result in employee resource costs and diversion of employee focus. If any requests or investigations continue over a long period of time, they could divert the attention of management from the day-to-day operations of our business and impose significant additional administrative burdens on us. These potential consequences, as well as any adverse outcome from these requests or investigations, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.In addition, certain foreign governments, state governments (including that of Massachusetts, where we are headquartered) and the U.S. federal government have enacted legislation aimed at increasing transparency of our interactions with healthcare providers. As an example, compliance with the U.S. Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires us by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to all U.S. physicians and U.S. teaching hospitals at the U.S. federal level made after August 1, 2013. Any failure to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements could impact our business. In addition, we have and may continue to devote substantial additional time and financial resources to further develop and implement enhanced structure, policies, systems and processes to comply with enhanced legal and regulatory requirements, which may also impact our business.We anticipate that governmental authorities will continue to scrutinize our industry closely and that additional regulation may increase compliance and legal cost and exposure to litigation and have additional adverse effects on our operations.Changes in tax laws, unfavorable resolution of tax contingencies, or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations and/or liquidity.We are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to on-going tax audits in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions we have taken and assess additional taxes. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision and have established contingency reserves for material, known tax exposures. However, the calculation of such tax exposures involves the application of complex tax laws and regulations in many jurisdictions, as well as interpretations as to the legality under European Union state aid rules of tax advantages granted in certain jurisdictions. Therefore, there can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of these disputes or other tax audits or that issues raised by tax authorities will be resolved at a financial cost that does not exceed our related reserves and the actual outcomes of these disputes and other tax audits could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition.On July 19, 2016, we entered into a Stipulation of Settled Issues with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) intended to resolve certain transfer pricing issues, as well as certain issues related to our transaction with Abbott Laboratories, for the 2001 through 2007 tax years. The Stipulation of Settled Issues is contingent upon IRS Office of Appeals applying the same basis of settlement to all transfer pricing issues for the Company’s 2008, 2009 and 2010 tax years and if applicable, review by the U.S. Congress Joint Committee on Taxation. In October 2016, we reached an agreement in principle with IRS Office of Appeals as to the resolution of the transfer pricing issues in 2008, 2009 and 2010 tax years, subject to additional calculations of tax as well as documentation to memorialize our agreement. The final resolution of these issues is contingent and if the Stipulation of Settled Issues is not finalized, it could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.Changes in tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, in the jurisdictions where we are subject to tax could materially impact our effective tax rate. The U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) on December 22, 2017 and we expect the U.S. Treasury to issue future notices and regulations under the TCJA. Certain provisions of the TCJA and the regulations issued thereunder could have a significant impact on our future results of operations as could interpretations made by the Company in the absence of regulatory guidance and judicial interpretations. Additionally, the U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of 25multinational corporations. One example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting,” where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. The OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting. As a result, the tax laws in the U.S. and other countries in which we and our affiliates do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could materially adversely affect our business.Our operations in Puerto Rico and Costa Rica presently benefit from various tax incentives and grants. Unless these incentives and grants are extended, they will expire between 2023 and 2028. If we are unable to renew, extend, or obtain new incentive and grants, the expiration of the existing incentives and grants could have a material impact on our financial results in future periods.We may not effectively be able to protect our intellectual property or other sensitive data, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.The medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Physician customers have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However, intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable and appellate courts can overturn lower court decisions. Furthermore, as our business increasingly relies on technology systems and infrastructure, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation. Finally, our ability to protect novel business models is uncertain. Competing parties in our industry frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only of individual cases, but also of a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies.A number of third parties have asserted that our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. We have similarly asserted that products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us. Adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Patents and other proprietary rights are and will continue to be essential to our business and our ability to compete effectively with other companies will be dependent upon the proprietary nature of our technologies. We rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations, strategic alliances and licensing opportunities to develop, maintain and strengthen our competitive position. We pursue a policy of generally obtaining patent protection in both the U.S. and abroad for patentable subject matter in our proprietary devices and attempt to review third-party patents and patent applications to the extent publicly available in order to develop an effective patent strategy, avoid infringement of third-party patents, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the patent claims of others. We currently own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and have numerous patent applications pending. We also are party to various license agreements pursuant to which patent rights have been obtained or granted in consideration for cash, cross-licensing rights or royalty payments. No assurance can be made that any pending or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that any current or future patents issued to, or licensed by, us will not be challenged or circumvented by our competitors, or that our patents will not be found invalid. In addition, we may have to take legal action in the future to protect our patents, trade secrets or know-how or to assert them against claimed infringement by others. Any legal action of that type could be costly and time consuming and no assurances can be made that any lawsuit will be successful. We are generally involved as both a plaintiff and a defendant in a number of patent infringement and other intellectual property-related actions. The invalidation of key patents or proprietary rights that we own, or an unsuccessful outcome in lawsuits to protect our intellectual property, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.In addition, the laws of certain countries in which we market and plan on manufacturing some of our products in the near future, do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property in these countries, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Furthermore, our intellectual property, other proprietary technology and other sensitive data are potentially vulnerable to loss, damage or misappropriation from system malfunction, computer viruses and unauthorized access to our data or misappropriation 26or misuse thereof by those with permitted access and other events. While we have invested to protect our intellectual property, products and other data and continue to work diligently in this area, there can be no assurance that our precautionary measures will prevent breakdowns, breaches, cyber-attacks or other events. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.We rely on the proper function, availability and security of information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We rely on information technology systems, including technology from third party vendors, to process, transmit and store electronic information in our day-to-day operations. Similar to other large multi-national companies, the size and complexity of our information technology systems makes them vulnerable to a cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, breakdown, destruction, loss of data privacy, or other significant disruption. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving systems and regulatory standards, the increasing need to protect patient and customer information and changing customer patterns. In addition, third parties may attempt to hack into our products to obtain data relating to patients or disrupt performance of our products or to access our proprietary information and the technology from third party vendors that we rely upon may have defects or vulnerabilities which, in turn, create vulnerabilities or disruptions in our system. Any failure by us to maintain or protect our information technology systems and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches, could result in the unauthorized access to patient data and personally identifiable information, theft of intellectual property or other misappropriation of assets, or otherwise compromise our confidential or proprietary information and disrupt our operations. We also grow our company through acquisitions and may face risks associated with defects and vulnerabilities in their systems as we work to integrate the acquisitions into our information technology system. In the U.S., federal and state privacy and security laws require certain of our operations to protect the confidentiality of personal information including patient medical records and other health information. In Europe, the Data Protection Directive requires us to manage individually identifiable information in the EU and, the new General Data Protection Regulation may impose fines of up to four percent of our global revenue in the event of violations after implementation of the requirements on May 25, 2018. Internationally, some countries have also passed laws that require individually identifiable data on their citizens to be maintained on local servers and that may restrict transfer or processing of that data. We believe that we meet the expectations of applicable regulations and that the ongoing costs and impacts of ensuring compliance with such rules are not material to our business. However, there is no guarantee that we will avoid enforcement actions by governmental bodies. Enforcement actions could be costly and interrupt regular operations of our business. Any of these events, in turn, may cause us to lose existing customers, have difficulty preventing, detecting and controlling fraud, have disputes with customers, physicians and other healthcare professionals, be subject to legal claims and liability, have regulatory sanctions or penalties imposed, have increases in operating expenses, incur expenses or lose revenues as a result of a data privacy breach or theft of intellectual property, or suffer other adverse consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Pending and future intellectual property litigation could be costly and disruptive to us.We operate in an industry that is susceptible to significant intellectual property litigation and, in recent years, it has been common for companies in the medical device field to aggressively challenge the patent rights of other companies. We are currently the subject of various patent litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under Note J – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Intellectual property litigation is expensive, complex and lengthy and its outcome is difficult to predict. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial condition, results of operation or liquidity. Pending or future patent litigation may result in significant royalty or other payments or injunctions that can prevent the sale of products and may significantly divert the attention of our technical and management personnel. In the event that our right to market any of our products is successfully challenged, we may be required to obtain a license on terms which may not be favorable to us, if at all. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.Pending and future product liability claims and other litigation, including private securities litigation, stockholder derivative suits and contract litigation, may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations or liquidity.The design, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices of the types that we produce entail an inherent risk of product liability claims. Many of the medical devices that we manufacture and sell are designed to be implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. A number of factors could result in an unsafe condition or injury to, or death of, a patient with respect to these or other products that we manufacture or sell, including physician technique and experience in performing the surgical 27procedure, component failures, manufacturing flaws, design defects, off-label use or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information. These factors could result in product liability claims, a recall of one or more of our products or a safety alert relating to one or more of our products. Product liability claims may be brought by individuals or by groups seeking to represent a class.We are currently the subject of product liability litigation proceedings and other proceedings described in more detail under Note J – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2017 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits often seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, including not only actual damages, but also punitive damages. The magnitude of the potential losses relating to these lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, the cost to defend against any future litigation may be significant. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation and other litigation in the future, regardless of the outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity. Additionally, we maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims and we are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The fact that we do not maintain third-party insurance coverage for all categories of losses increases our exposure to unanticipated claims and adverse decisions and these losses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.Any failure to meet regulatory quality standards applicable to our manufacturing and quality processes could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. As a medical device manufacturer, we are required to register our establishments and list our devices with the FDA and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA for compliance with its Quality System Regulation requirements, which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations, including testing, quality control and documentation procedures. In addition, the Federal Medical Device Reporting regulations require us to provide information to the FDA whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or, if a malfunction were to occur, could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA which may result in observations on Form 483 and in some cases warning letters that require corrective action. In the European Community, we are required to maintain certain International Standards Organization (ISO) certifications in order to sell our products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications. Many other countries in which we do business have requirements similar to those of the US or the EU and other foreign governments or agencies may subject us to periodic inspections as well. If we, or our manufacturers, fail to adhere to quality system regulations or ISO requirements, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.Interruption of our manufacturing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Our products are designed and manufactured in technology centers around the world, either by us or third parties. In most cases, the manufacturing of our products is concentrated in one or a few locations. Factors such as a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, equipment malfunction, environmental factors or damage to one or more of our facilities could adversely affect our ability to manufacture our products. In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to quickly move to alternate means of producing affected products or to meet customer demand. In the event of a significant interruption, for example, as a result of a failure to follow regulatory protocols and procedures, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due primarily to needs for regulatory approvals. As a result, we may experience loss of market share, which we may be unable to recapture and harm to our reputation, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.Disruptions in the supply of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products or the sterilization of our products by third-party vendors could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We purchase many of the materials and components used in manufacturing our products from third-party vendors. Certain of these materials and components are purchased from single sources due to quality considerations, expertise, costs or constraints resulting from regulatory requirements. In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement vendors for such materials or components in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA regulations that require validation of materials and components prior to their use in our products and the complex nature of our and many of our vendors' manufacturing processes. A reduction or interruption in the supply of materials and components used in manufacturing our products, an inability to timely develop and validate alternative sources if required or a significant increase in the price of such materials or components could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. 28In addition, many of our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and contract sterilizers to perform this service. To the extent we or our contract sterilizers are unable to sterilize our products, whether due to capacity, availability of materials for sterilization, regulatory or other constraints, we may be unable to transition to other contract sterilizer, sterilizer locations or sterilization methods in a timely or cost effective manner or at all, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.Our share price has been volatile and may fluctuate, and accordingly, the value of an investment in our common stock may also fluctuate.Stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility over recent years. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due to factors described under this Item 1A. Risk Factors, as well as economic and geopolitical conditions in general and to variability in the prevailing sentiment regarding our operations or business prospects, as well as, among other things, changing investment priorities of our stockholders. Because the market price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, stockholders may not be able sell their shares at attractive prices. If we are unable to attract or retain key personnel, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results from operations. In our industry, there is substantial competition for key personnel in the regions in which we operate and we may face increased competition for such employees, particularly in emerging markets as the trend toward globalization continues. Our business depends to a significant extent on the continued service of senior management and other key personnel, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining and developing existing personnel or recruiting new personnel. The loss of one or more key employees, our ability to attract or develop additional qualified employees or any delay in hiring key personnel could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 29ITEM 1B.

Our product offerings include the following:•Precision™, Precision Spectra™, Precision Montage™, Precision Novi™, Spectra WaveWriter™ and WaveWriter Alpha™ Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) Systems, designed to provide improved pain relief to a wide range of patients who suffer from chronic pain,•Superion™ Indirect Decompression Systems, minimally-invasive devices used to improve physical function and reduce pain in patients with moderate lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS) purchased as part of the acquisition of Vertiflex, Inc. in the second quarter of 2019,•our G4™ Generator and consumable portfolio in Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) for pain management used by physicians to treat patients with chronic pain, and•Vercise™, Vercise™ PC, Vercise Gevia™ and Vercise Genus™ Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Systems for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, tremor, and intractable primary and secondary dystonia, a neurological movement disorder characterized by involuntary muscle contractions.Our Spectra WaveWriter™ SCS System is the first system approved by the FDA to simultaneously provide paresthesia-based and sub-perception therapy. The Precision Spectra SCS System is the world's first and only SCS system with 32 contacts and 32 dedicated power sources. We believe that we continue to have a technological advantage due to our proprietary features such as Multiple Independent Current Control and our Illumina 3D™ Proprietary Programming Software, which together are intended to allow the physician to target specific areas of pain and customize stimulation of nerve fibers more precisely. We announced the European launch of the WaveWriter Alpha™ Spinal Cord Stimulator (SCS) System in the third quarter of 2020 and received FDA approval in the fourth quarter of 2020 and followed with U.S. launch, indicated as an aid in the management of chronic intractable pain of the trunk and/or limbs including unilateral or bilateral pain associated with failed back surgery syndrome and complex regional pain syndrome.Our Vercise™ DBS Systems are approved in the U.S. as an adjunctive therapy that aids in reducing some of the symptoms of moderate to advanced Parkinson’s disease as well as for patients diagnosed with essential tremor. In the third quarter of 2020, we received CE Mark and initiated a limited market release of the fourth generation Vercise Genus™ DBS System in Europe, and launched in the U.S in the first quarter of 2021, following FDA approval. The Vercise Genus™ DBS platform features a full portfolio of primary cell and rechargeable MRI conditional systems with Bluetooth connectivity and the Cartesia™ Directional Lead, providing multi-directional stimulation designed for greater precision, intended to minimize side effects for patients. In Europe, we also market the GUIDE™ XT System, the first DBS visualization system built for directionality that utilizes patient specific anatomy and stimulation field modeling. This technology provides physicians with 3-D image planning capability and when used in conjunction with the Vercise DBS Systems, enables physicians to personalize and optimize DBS treatment. 6CardiovascularInterventional CardiologyOur Interventional Cardiology business develops and manufactures technologies for diagnosing and treating coronary artery disease and structural heart conditions. Our broad, innovative product offerings have led to our leadership in the global interventional cardiology market.Drug-Eluting Coronary Stent Systems Our drug-eluting coronary stent product offerings are an important element of our global Interventional Cardiology market leadership.

Our consolidated net sales include Specialty Pharmaceuticals up to the date of the closing of the transaction. MarketsCompetitionWe encounter significant competition across our product lines and in each market in which we sell our products and solutions, some from companies that may have greater financial, sales and marketing resources than we do. Our primary competitors include Abbott Laboratories and Medtronic plc, as well as a wide range of medical device companies that sell a single or limited number of competitive products or participate in only a specific market segment. In certain countries, we face competition from domestic medical device companies that may benefit from their status as local suppliers. We also face competition from non-medical device companies, which may offer alternative therapies for disease states that could also be treated using our products, or from companies offering technologies that could augment or replace procedures using our products. We believe that our products and solutions compete primarily on their ability to deliver both differentiated clinical and economic outcomes for our customers by enabling physicians to perform diagnostic and therapeutic procedures safely and effectively often in a less-invasive and cost effective manner. We also compete on ease of use, comparative effectiveness, reliability and physician familiarity. In the current environment of managed care, with economically motivated buyers, consolidation among healthcare providers, increasing prevalence and importance of regional and national tenders, increased competition and declining reimbursement rates, we have been increasingly required to compete on the basis of price, value, reliability and efficiency. We believe the current global economic conditions and healthcare reform measures could continue to put additional competitive pressure on us, including on our average selling prices, overall procedure rates and addressable market sizes. We recognize that our continued competitive success will depend upon our ability to: •offer products and solutions that provide differentiated clinical and economic outcomes,•create or acquire innovative, scientifically advanced technologies,•apply our technology and solutions cost-effectively and with superior quality across product lines and markets,•develop or acquire proprietary products and solutions,•attract and retain qualified personnel, •obtain patent or other protection for our products,•obtain required regulatory and reimbursement approvals,•compete in regional and national tenders for our products,•continually provide quality products and enhance our quality systems, •manufacture and market our products and solutions either directly or through third parties, and •supply sufficient inventory at competitive prices to meet customer demand.9Research and Development Our investment in research and development is critical to driving our future growth. Our investment in research and development supports the following:•internal research and development programs, regulatory design and clinical science, as well as other programs obtained through our strategic acquisitions and alliances, and•engineering efforts that incorporate customer feedback into continuous improvement efforts for currently marketed and next-generation products.We have directed our development efforts toward innovative technologies designed to expand current markets or enter adjacent markets. We are transforming how we conduct research and development by identifying best practices, driving efficiencies and optimizing our cost structure, which we believe will enable increased development activity and faster concept-to-market timelines. Focused, cross-functional teams take a formal approach to new product design and development, helping us to manufacture and offer innovative products consistently and efficiently. Involving cross-functional teams early in the process is the cornerstone of our product development cycle. We believe this collaboration allows our teams to concentrate resources on the most viable and clinically relevant new products and technologies and to maximize cost and time savings as we bring them to market.In addition to internal development, we work with hundreds of leading research institutions, universities and clinicians around the world to develop, evaluate and clinically test our products. We are expanding our collaborations to include research and development teams in our emerging market countries; these teams will focus on both global and local market requirements at a lower cost of development. We believe that these efforts will play a significant role in our future success.Marketing and SalesIn 2021, we marketed our products and solutions to approximately 35,000 hospitals, clinics, outpatient facilities and medical offices in more than 120 countries worldwide. Large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales. We have a dedicated corporate accounts organization in the United States (U.S.) and Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) focused principally on selling to major buying groups and integrated healthcare networks. We consistently strive to understand and exceed the expectations of our customers. Each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focused on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions, as well as on key hospital service line administrators. We believe that this dual focus on disease state management and hospital administrators enables us to develop highly knowledgeable and dedicated sales representatives and to foster collaborative relationships with both physicians and key service line administrators. We believe that our strong working relationships with physicians, service line administrators and others in the medical industry enable us to gain a detailed understanding of new therapeutic and diagnostic alternatives and to respond quickly to our customers' changing needs. The majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations. We also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets. We expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third party distributors in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence. International OperationsMaintaining and expanding our international presence is an important component of our long-term growth strategy. Through our international presence, we seek to increase net sales and market share, leverage our relationships with leading physicians and their clinical research programs, accelerate the time to bring new products to market and gain access to worldwide technological developments that we can implement across our product lines. We define Emerging Markets as the 20 countries that we believe have strong growth potential based on their economic conditions, healthcare sectors and our global capabilities. We have increased our investment in infrastructure in these countries in order to maximize opportunities. Periodically, we assess our list of Emerging Markets countries, and effective January 1, 2021, modified our list to include the following countries: Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Czech Republic, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Philippines, Poland, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Slovakia, South Africa, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey and Vietnam. Our Emerging Markets net sales represented 12 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2021 and 11 percent in 2020.As of December 31, 2021, we maintained various international manufacturing facilities, in addition to our facilities in the U.S. & Puerto Rico, in Ireland, Costa Rica, Brazil, Malaysia, Israel, Canada, the U.K. and Switzerland. In 2021, approximately 50 10percent of our manufactured products were produced at these international facilities. We also maintain research and development capabilities in Canada, China, Costa Rica, India, Ireland and Israel, and provide localized training programs through our Institutes for Advancing Science (IAS) facilities around the world.ResourcesManufacturing and Raw MaterialsWe are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization. We strive to improve the efficiency of our sourcing operations and to leverage the technical expertise of the broader market by partnering with strategic suppliers. In doing so, we seek to focus our internal resources on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products. We continue to implement new systems designed to provide improved quality, reliability, service, greater efficiency and lower supply chain costs. We also drive continuous improvement in product quality through process controls and validations, supplier and distribution controls and training and tools for our operations team. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to enhance our operational effectiveness by identifying cost-improvement opportunities. We remain committed to maintaining appropriate investments to ensure supply chain stability. We have an ongoing supplier resiliency program which identifies and mitigates risk and have taken measures to mitigate the impact of challenges within the global supply chain resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing, sterilization and distribution capabilities and partnerships and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions. Many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We have recently experienced increased levels of unpredictability in the supply of certain raw materials and components used in the manufacturing of our products. While we continue to believe we will have access to the raw materials and components that we need, these supply chain dynamics could result in increased costs to us or an inability to fully meet customer demand for certain of our products. On an on-going basis, we track supplier status and inventory in risk areas and take action to prevent shortages, monitoring safety stock levels and building up product supplies as warranted, and mitigating risk of technology and material shortages by identifying new vendors. Our approach to supplier selection involves building diversity, equity and inclusion throughout the Boston Scientific supplier network. We are committed to the increased and sustained support of diverse businesses that share our dedication to improving the quality of patient care. As part of our strategy to combat racism, we have taken steps to further expand the number of Black-owned enterprises that provide supply chain services for our business in the U.S. We are also supporting small and diverse vendors by shortening payment terms for those whose business with us is under $250,000.Proprietary Rights and Patent LitigationWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property to protect our proprietary rights. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and other countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. As of December 31, 2021, we held more than 18,000 patents and had approximately 6,000 patent applications pending worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to our business as a whole.We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties. We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims. We are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence 11of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions.

Large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups have become increasingly important to our business and represent a substantial portion of our net sales. Each of our businesses maintains dedicated sales forces and marketing teams focused on physicians who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of different medical conditions, as well as on key hospital service line administrators. The majority of our net sales are derived from countries in which we have direct sales organizations. We also have a network of distributors and dealers who offer our products in certain countries and markets. We expect to continue to leverage our infrastructure in markets where commercially appropriate and use third party distributors in those markets where it is not economical or strategic to establish or maintain a direct presence. ResourcesManufacturing and Raw MaterialsWe are focused on continuously improving our supply chain effectiveness, strengthening our manufacturing processes and increasing operational efficiencies within our organization worldwide. In doing so, we seek to focus our internal resources on the development and commercial launch of new products and the enhancement of existing products. We also drive continuous improvement in product quality through process controls and validations, supplier and distribution controls and training and tools for our operations team. In addition, we remain focused on examining our operations and general business activities to enhance our operational effectiveness by identifying cost-improvement opportunities. We remain committed to maintaining appropriate investments to ensure supply chain stability. We have an ongoing supplier resiliency program which identifies and mitigates risk and have taken measures to mitigate the impact of challenges within the global supply chain, including those caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic. We consistently monitor our inventory levels, manufacturing, sterilization and distribution capabilities and partnerships and maintain recovery plans to address potential disruptions. Many components used in the manufacturing of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources; however, certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. On an on-going basis, we track supplier status and inventory in risk areas and take action to prevent shortages, monitoring safety stock levels and building up product supplies as warranted, and mitigating risk of technology and material shortages by identifying new vendors.8We have experienced increased levels of unpredictability in the supply of certain raw materials and components used in the manufacturing of our products. While we continue to believe we will have access to the raw materials and components that we need, these supply chain dynamics could result in increased costs to us or an inability to fully meet customer demand for certain of our products. Proprietary Rights and Patent LitigationWe rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, trade secrets and other forms of intellectual property to protect our proprietary rights. We generally file patent applications in the U.S. and other countries where patent protection for our technology is appropriate and available. We hold patents worldwide that cover various aspects of our technology. In addition, we hold exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to a variety of third-party technologies covered by patents and patent applications. In the aggregate, these intellectual property assets and licenses are of material importance to our business; however, we believe that no single patent, technology, trademark, intellectual property asset or license is material in relation to our business as a whole.We rely on non-disclosure and non-competition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the medical device industry, particularly in the areas in which we compete. We continue to defend ourselves against claims and legal actions alleging infringement of the patent rights of others. Additionally, we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights, to protect our trade secrets or know-how and to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we may seek to settle some or all of our pending litigation, particularly to manage risk over time. Settlement may include cross licensing of the patents that are the subject of the litigation as well as our other intellectual property and may involve monetary payments to or from third parties. We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims. We are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and fully self-insured with respect to intellectual property infringement claims. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions.

885725,BSX,BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORP,2010,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Introduction Boston Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. Our business strategy is to lead global markets for less-invasive medical devices by developing and marketing innovative products, services and therapies that address unmet patient needs, provide superior clinical outcomes and demonstrate compelling value. In the first quarter of 2008, we completed the divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses. Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2007 include a full year of results of these businesses. Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008 include the results of these businesses through the date of separation. We are involved in several post-closing separation activities through transition service agreements, some from which we continued to generate net sales during 2009. Many of these transition service agreements expired throughout 2009 and the remainder will be completed during the first half of 2010. Refer to the Restructuring Initiatives section and Note F — Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a description of these business divestitures. Executive Summary Financial Highlights and Trends Our net sales in 2009 were $8.188 billion, which included net sales from divested businesses of $11 million, as compared to net sales of $8.050 billion in 2008, which included net sales from divested business of $69 million, an increase of $138 million, or two percent. Foreign currency fluctuations decreased our net sales by $92 million in 2009, as compared to 2008. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and net sales from divested businesses, our net sales increased $288 million, or four percent, as compared to the prior year. Worldwide net sales in our cardiac rhythm management (CRM) group increased $123 million, or five percent in 2009, as compared to 2008. Excluding the negative impact of foreign currency, our worldwide CRM group net sales increased seven percent. This increase was driven by the continued success of our next-generation COGNIS® cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) and our TELIGEN® implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) systems, launched in the U.S., our Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) region and certain Inter-Continental countries in 2008 and in Japan in 2009, as well as growing adoption of our ALTRUA® family of pacemaker systems, launched worldwide during 2008. In addition, worldwide net sales of our coronary stent systems increased $28 million, or two percent, on the success of our two-drug platform strategy and industry leadership for the widest range of coronary stent sizes. We are the only company in the industry to offer a two-drug platform strategy, which we believe has enabled us to maintain our leadership position in the worldwide drug-eluting stent market. Worldwide net sales from our Endoscopy business grew $63 million, or seven percent, achieving net sales of $1.006 billion in 2009, on the continued success of our biliary and hemostasis franchises. Worldwide net sales from our Urology/Women’s Health business grew $25 million, or six percent, due primarily to several successful product launches within our Women’s Health franchise during the year. Our Neuromodulation division increased worldwide net sales $40 million, or 17 percent, in 2009, as compared to 2008, as a result of the continued adoption of our Precision® Spinal Cord Stimulation system. Net sales from our Neurovascular business decreased $12 million, or three percent, in 2009, as compared to 2008, 38 Table of Contents but are expected to benefit from upcoming product launches in 2010. Refer to the Business and Market Overview and Results of Operations sections for discussion of our net sales by division and region. Our reported net loss in 2009 was $(1.025) billion, or $(0.68) per share, on approximately 1.5 billion weighted-average shares outstanding, as compared to a net loss in 2008 of $(2.036) billion, or $(1.36) per share, also on 1.5 billion weighted-average shares outstanding. Our reported results for 2009 included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and restructuring-related net charges; and discrete tax items of $1.785 billion (after-tax), or $1.18 per share, consisting of: • $10 million ($12 million pre-tax) of intangible asset impairment charges; • $20 million ($21 million pre-tax), of purchased research and development charges associated with the acquisition of certain technology rights; • $7 million ($8 million pre-tax) of gains on the sale of non-strategic investments and other credits associated with prior period divestitures of non-strategic businesses; • $97 million ($130 million pre-tax) of costs associated with our 2007 Restructuring plan and Plant Network Optimization program; • $1.771 billion ($2.022 billion pre-tax) of net charges associated with various litigation matters; and • $106 million of discrete tax benefits related to certain tax positions associated with prior period acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and restructuring-related charges. On February 1, 2010, we announced the settlement of three patent litigation matters with Johnson & Johnson for $1.725 billion, plus interest. We have accounted for this settlement as of December 31, 2009 in our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Refer to the Results of Operations section and Note L — Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Our reported results for 2008 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and restructuring-related net charges; and discrete tax items of $2.796 billion (after-tax), or $1.87 per share, consisting of: • $2.613 billion, on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis, of goodwill impairment charges, associated with our 2006 acquisition of Guidant Corporation; • $143 million ($177 million pre-tax) of other intangible asset impairment charges; • a $184 million gain ($250 million pre-tax) related to the receipt of an acquisition-related milestone from Abbott Laboratories; • $44 million ($43 million pre-tax) of net purchased research and development charges, associated primarily with our acquisitions of Labcoat, Ltd. and CryoCor, Inc.; • $100 million of costs ($133 million pre-tax) associated with our 2007 Restructuring plan and Plant Network Optimization program; • a $131 million net gain ($170 million pre-tax), associated with the sale of certain non-strategic businesses and investments; • $238 million of litigation-related charges ($334 million pre-tax) resulting primarily from a ruling by a federal judge in a patent infringement case brought against us by Johnson & Johnson; and • $27 million of discrete tax benefits related to certain tax positions associated with prior period acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation-, and restructuring-related charges. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test and recorded a $2.613 billion goodwill impairment charge associated with our acquisition of Guidant Corporation. The impact of economic conditions, and the related increase in volatility in the equity and credit markets, on our risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, along with reductions in market demand for products in our U.S. CRM reporting unit relative to our assumptions at the time of our acquisition of Guidant, were the key factors contributing to the 39 Table of Contents impairment charge. Refer to Note E — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. Cash generated by operating activities was $835 million in 2009 and $1.216 billion in 2008, and continues to be a major source of funds for servicing our outstanding debt obligations and investing in our growth. Our cash flows from operations in 2009 includes a $716 million payment to Johnson & Johnson related to certain patent disputes, discussed in Note L — Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2009, we had total debt of $5.918 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $864 million and working capital of $1.039 billion. On February 1, 2010, we made a $1.000 billion litigation-related payment to Johnson & Johnson, using $800 million of cash on hand, and $200 million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, and will pay an additional $725 million on or before January 3, 2011. During 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of senior notes and prepaid all $2.825 billion remaining under our term loan. In addition, Standard & Poor’s upgraded our credit rating to investment grade with a stable outlook. This rating improvement reflects the strength of our product portfolio, our commitment to debt reduction, our improving financial fundamentals, and the progress we are making in driving profitable sales growth. We expect to refinance the majority of our 2011 debt maturities and revolving credit facility by mid-2010. Healthcare Reform and Current Economic Climate Political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to potential fundamental changes that could substantially affect our results of operations. Government and private sector initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, competitive pricing, coverage and payment policies, comparative effectiveness of therapies, technology assessments and managed-care arrangements, are continuing in many countries where we do business, including the U.S. These changes are causing the marketplace to put increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost-effective treatments. Although we believe our less-invasive products and technologies generate favorable clinical outcomes, value and cost efficiency, the resources necessary to demonstrate comparative effectiveness may be significant. In addition, uncertainty remains regarding proposed significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system, including the potential innovation tax on medical device companies. Additionally, our results of operations could be substantially affected by global economic factors and local operating and economic conditions. Our customers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations which may adversely impact their ability or decision to purchase our products, particularly capital equipment, or to pay for our products they do purchase on a timely basis, if at all. We cannot predict to what extent global economic conditions and the increased focus on healthcare systems and costs in the U.S. and abroad may negatively impact our average selling prices, our net sales and profit margins, procedural volumes and reimbursement rates from third party payors. Restructuring Initiatives We are a diversified worldwide medical device leader and hold number one or two positions in the majority of the markets in which we compete. Over the past thirty years, we have generated impressive revenue growth driven by product innovation, strategic acquisitions and robust investments in research and development. We generate strong cash flow, which has enabled us to reduce our debt obligations and further invest in our growth. On an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, and better alignment of expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in quality, research and development projects, capital and our people that are essential to our long-term success. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives to focus our business, diversify and reprioritize our product 40 Table of Contents portfolio and redirect research and development and other spending toward higher payoff products in order to enhance our growth potential. These initiatives are described below. 2010 Restructuring Plan On February 6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to strengthen and position us for long-term success. Key activities under the plan include the integration of our Cardiovascular and CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions; the centralization of our research and development organization; the re-alignment of our international structure, and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio, in order to drive innovation, accelerate profitable growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring Plan will be initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2011. We expect the execution of the 2010 Restructuring plan will result in the elimination of approximately 1,000 to 1,300 positions worldwide by the end of 2011. Refer to Results of Operations and Note H — Restructuring-related Activities to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information on our restructuring-related activities and estimated costs. Plant Network Optimization In January 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a Plant Network Optimization program, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The program is a complement to our 2007 Restructuring plan, and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2011. Refer to Results of Operations and Note H — Restructuring-related Activities to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information on our restructuring-related activities and estimated costs. 2007 Restructuring Plan In October 2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count reduction plan (the 2007 Restructuring plan), These initiatives were designed to enhance short- and long-term shareholder value, including the restructuring of several of our businesses and product franchises; the sale of non-strategic businesses and investments; and significant expense and head count reductions. Our goal was, and continues to be, to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in quality, research and development, capital improvements and our people that are essential to our long-term success. These initiatives have helped to provide better focus on our core businesses and priorities, which we believe will strengthen Boston Scientific for the future and position us for increased, sustainable and profitable sales growth. The execution of this plan enabled us to reduce research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately $500 million exiting 2008, and resulted in the elimination of approximately 2,300 positions worldwide. We initiated activities under the plan in the fourth quarter of 2007 and substantially completed the major activities under the plan as of December 31, 2009. Refer to Results of Operations and Note H — Restructuring-related Activities to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information on our restructuring-related activities and estimated costs. Divestitures During 2007, we determined that our Auditory, Vascular Surgery, Cardiac Surgery, Venous Access and Fluid Management businesses, as well as our TriVascular Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR) program were no longer strategic to our on-going operations. We completed the sale of these businesses in the first 41 Table of Contents quarter of 2008, receiving pre-tax proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion, and eliminated 2,000 positions in connection with these divestitures. Refer to Results of Operations for more information. During 2007, we announced our intent to monetize those investments in our portfolio determined to be non-strategic. During 2008, we entered transactions to sell the majority of our investments in, and notes receivable from, certain publicly traded and privately held entities, and received pre-tax proceeds for investments sold of $149 million. During 2009, we completed the sale of our non-strategic investments, and received additional proceeds of $45 million. In connection with our 2010 Restructuring plan and strategy to reduce risk, increase operational leverage and accelerate profitable growth, we may explore opportunities to divest one or more select businesses. Business and Market Overview Cardiac Rhythm Management We estimate that the worldwide CRM market, including Electrophysiology, approximated $12.6 billion in 2009, as compared to $12.2 billion in 2008. During the third quarter of 2009, results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine from the Boston Scientific sponsored MADIT-CRT clinical trial, which provide evidence that Boston Scientific’s CRT-D therapy significantly reduces the relative risk of all-cause mortality or first heart failure intervention when compared to traditional ICD therapy. These results demonstrated that early intervention with Boston Scientific’s CRT-D therapy in certain patients can slow the progression of heart failure. In addition, during the second quarter of 2009, we announced eight-year follow-up data from our MADIT II clinical study, which demonstrated that the life-saving benefits of ICD therapy improved over time. We have completed a pre-market approval filing with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for an expanded CRT-D indication, and believe that we can reasonably expect FDA approval by mid-2010. We believe an expanded indication would create an opportunity to strengthen the CRM market and further enhance our position within that market. Our CRM group net sales represented approximately 31 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2009 and 2008. Our worldwide CRM group net sales increased $123 million, or five percent, in 2009, as compared to 2008. The following are the components of our worldwide CRM group net sales: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 (in millions) U.S. International Total U.S. International Total ICD systems $ 1,248 $ 544 $ 1,792 $ 1,140 $ 541 $ 1,681 Pacemaker systems 346 275 621 340 265 605 CRM products 1,594 819 2,413 1,480 806 2,286 Electrophysiology 116 33 149 116 37 153 Total CRM group $ 1,710 $ 852 $ 2,562 $ 1,596 $ 843 $ 2,439 Our U.S. CRM group net sales increased $114 million, or seven percent, in 2009, as compared to 2008. Our U.S. net sales benefited from the continued success of our next-generation COGNIS® CRT-D and TELIGEN® ICD systems, and our ALTRUA® family of pacemaker systems, as well as marginal growth in the size of the U.S. CRM market. In 2010, we will continue to execute on our product pipeline and expect to launch our next-generation line of defibrillators in the U.S. by the end of the year, which includes new features designed to improve functionality, diagnostic capability and ease of use, and anticipate launching our next-generation INGENIO™ pacemaker system in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2011. Our international CRM group net sales increased $9 million, or one percent, in 2009, as compared to 2008. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, which contributed a negative $42 million to 42 Table of Contents 2009 CRM group net sales as compared to the prior year, international sales of our ICD systems (including CRT-D systems) grew $31 million, or six percent, driven by the continued adoption of our COGNIS® CRT-D and TELIGEN® ICD systems. Further, our international pacemaker system net sales increased $18 million, or seven percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, in 2009, as compared to 2008, driven primarily by growing adoption of our ALTRUA® family of pacemakers. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we launched our COGNIS® CRT-D, TELIGEN® ICD and ALTRUA® pacemaker systems in Japan. We are targeting the completion of our international launch of these systems in early 2010. In addition, in July 2009, we received CE Mark approval for our LATITUDE® Patient Management System and have begun a phased launch in certain European countries. The LATITUDE® technology, which enables physicians to monitor device performance remotely while patients are in their homes, is a key component of many of our implantable device systems. We also plan to launch our next-generation INGENIO™ pacemaker system in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries in the first quarter of 2011, and in Japan in the fourth quarter of 2011, and believe that these launches position us well within the worldwide CRM market. Net sales from our CRM group represent a significant source of our overall net sales. Therefore, increases or decreases in our CRM group net sales could have a significant impact on our results of operations. Recent disciplinary actions we have taken against certain of our U.S. CRM sales personnel could result in lost U.S. CRM net sales in the short term. We believe that with sustained targeted investments we can continue to grow our worldwide CRM business. However, the following variables may impact the size of the CRM market and/or our share of that market: • future product field actions or new physician advisories by us or our competitors; • the impact of market and economic conditions on average selling prices and the overall number of procedures performed; • our ability to successfully launch next-generation products and technology worldwide, and to effectively compete with new products available in the market; • the ability of CRM manufacturers to maintain the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community, the referring physician community and prospective patients in CRM technologies • the successful conclusion and variations in outcomes of on-going and future clinical trials that may provide opportunities to expand indications for use and timely receipt of regulatory approvals to expand indications for use; • variations in clinical results, reliability or product performance of our and our competitors’ products; • delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; • our ability to retain key members of our sales team and other key personnel, particularly following disciplinary actions taken during the year; and • new competitive launches. Coronary Stents Net sales of our coronary stent systems represented approximately 23 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2009 and 2008. We estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market approximated $5.0 billion in 2009 and 2008. The size of the coronary stent market is driven primarily by the number of 43 Table of Contents percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures performed, as well as the percentage of those in which stents are implanted; the number of devices used per procedure; average selling prices; and the drug-eluting stent penetration rate2. Historically, uncertainty regarding the efficacy of drug-eluting stent systems, as well as the perceived risk of late stent thrombosis3 following the use of drug-eluting stent systems, contributed to a decline in the worldwide drug-eluting stent market size. However, data addressing this risk and supporting the safety of drug-eluting stent systems positively affected trends in the growth of the drug-eluting stent market throughout 2008 and 2009, as referring cardiologists regained and maintain confidence in this technology. We are the only company in the industry to offer a two-drug platform strategy with our TAXUS® paclitaxel-eluting stent system and our everolimus product franchise, consisting of the PROMUS® stent system, currently supplied to us by Abbott Laboratories, and our next-generation internally-manufactured everolimus-eluting stent system, the PROMUS® Element™ stent system, which we launched in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries in the fourth quarter of 2009. We expect to launch our PROMUS® Element™ stent system in the U.S. and Japan in mid-2012. Our product pipeline also includes the next-generation TAXUS® Element™ stent system, which we expect to launch in EMEA and certain Inter-Continental countries during the second quarter of 2010, in the U.S. in mid-2011 and Japan in late 2011 or early 2012. Recently published data from a single-center, non-double blinded, underpowered study sponsored by one of our competitors are inconsistent with the overall body of evidence supporting our TAXUS® paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system. However, perceptions of these data have negatively affected, and may continue to have a negative impact on, physician and patient confidence in our technology and net sales of our TAXUS® stent systems. The following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales: Year Ended Year Ended December 31, 2009 December 31, 2008 (in millions) U.S. International Total U.S. International Total TAXUS® $ 431 $ 596 $ 1,027 $ 621 $ 697 $ 1,318 PROMUS® 480 201 681 212 104 316 Drug-eluting 911 797 1,708 833 801 1,634 Bare-metal 57 114 171 88 129 217 $ 968 $ 911 $ 1,879 $ 921 $ 930 $ 1,851 Our U.S. net sales of drug-eluting stent systems increased $78 million, or nine percent, in 2009, as compared to the prior year. Despite an increase in competition following two new market entrants during 2008, we maintained our leadership position during 2009 with an estimated 49 percent share of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market, exiting the year with an estimated 46 percent share during the fourth quarter of 2009. We believe we have maintained our position in this market due to the success of our two-drug platform strategy. The strength of our TAXUS® Liberté® stent system and the PROMUS® stent system, as well as our TAXUS® Express2® Atom™ stent system, launched in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2008, have combined to enable us to sustain our leadership in the U.S. drug-eluting stent market. In the second quarter of 2009, we received FDA approval for the TAXUS® Liberté® Atom™ stent system and, in July 2009, we received approval for the TAXUS® Liberté® Long stent system, further adding to our industry leadership for the widest range of coronary stent sizes. In addition, increasing penetration rates have had a positive effect on the size of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market and our net sales. Average drug-eluting stent penetration rates in the U.S. were 75 percent during 2009, exiting at 77 percent for the fourth quarter of 2009, as compared to 68 percent for 2008, with an exit rate of 73 percent. Penetration rates in the U.S. consistently increased throughout 2008 and have remained steady throughout 2009, 2 A measure of the mix between bare-metal and drug-eluting stents used across procedures. 3 Late stent thrombosis is the formation of a clot, or thrombus, within the stented area one year or more after implantation of the stent. 44 Table of Contents indicating a recovery and stabilization of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market. Partially offsetting the impact of increased penetration rates on the size of the market were reductions in average selling prices in 2009, as compared to 2008, as a result of competitive pricing pressures. We estimate that the average selling price of our drug-eluting stent systems in the U.S. decreased approximately eight percent in 2009, as compared to the prior year. Our international drug-eluting stent system net sales decreased $4 million, or less than one percent, in 2009 as compared to 2008, but were negatively impacted by $22 million, as compared to the same period in the prior year, as a result of foreign currency exchange rates. Within our international business, net sales of our drug-eluting stent systems in Japan increased $45 million, or 20 percent, in 2009, as compared to the prior year, driven primarily by the favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates in that region, as well as the February launch of our second-generation TAXUS® Liberté® stent system. We estimate that our share of the drug-eluting stent market in Japan was 49 percent in 2009, exiting at 44 percent, as compared to a 2008 average market share of 45 percent. Previously, our TAXUS® drug-eluting stent system was one of only two drug-eluting stent products on the market in Japan. In May 2009, however, an additional competitor entered this market, which negatively impacted our share throughout the second half of the year. In the first quarter of 2010, we received approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) for the PROMUS® stent, and subsequently launched this product in Japan. Our net sales of drug-eluting stent systems in our EMEA region decreased $42 million, or eleven percent, and net sales of these systems in our Inter-Continental region decreased $7 million, or three percent, both due primarily to the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates and reductions in our average selling prices. In November 2009, we announced receipt of CE Mark approval to market our next-generation internally-manufactured everolimus-eluting stent system, the PROMUS® Element™ stent system, and simultaneously launched this stent system in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries. Our PROMUS® Element™ stent system incorporates a unique platinum chromium alloy offering greater radial strength and flexibility than older alloys, and provides enhanced visibility and reduced recoil. The innovative stent design improves deliverability and allows for more consistent lesion coverage and drug distribution. This latest product offering demonstrates our commitment to drug-eluting stent market leadership and continued innovation. Our product pipeline also includes the next-generation TAXUS® Element™ stent system, which we expect to launch in EMEA and certain Inter-Continental countries during the first half of 2010, in the U.S. in mid-2011 and Japan in late 2011 or early 2012. We market the PROMUS® everolimus-eluting coronary stent system, a private-labeled XIENCE V® stent system supplied to us by Abbott Laboratories. As of the closing of Abbott’s 2006 acquisition of Guidant Corporation’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, we obtained a perpetual license to the intellectual property used in Guidant’s drug-eluting stent system program purchased by Abbott. We believe that being the only company to offer two distinct drug-eluting stent platforms provides us a considerable advantage in the drug-eluting stent market and has enabled us to sustain our worldwide leadership position, with an estimated 39 percent market share exiting 2009. However, under the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit and operating profit margin of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott, including any improvements or iterations approved for sale during the term of the applicable supply arrangements and of the type that could be approved by a supplement to an approved FDA pre-market approval, is significantly lower than that of our TAXUS® stent system. Specifically, the PROMUS® stent system has operating profit margins that approximate half of our TAXUS® stent system operating profit margin. Therefore, if sales of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott increase in relation to our total drug-eluting stent system sales, our profit margins will decrease. Refer to our Gross Profit discussion for more information on the impact this sales mix has had on our gross profit margins. We expect that our PROMUS® ElementTM stent system, launched in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries in November 2009, will have gross profit margins more comparable to our TAXUS® stent system and will positively affect our overall gross profit and operating profit margins in these regions. However, this positive impact on our 45 Table of Contents gross profit margin will be offset by the impact of recent approval and launch of the PROMUS® stent system, supplied to us by Abbott, in Japan. Further, the price we pay for our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems from Abbott is determined by contracts with Abbott and is based, in part, on previously fixed estimates of Abbott’s manufacturing costs for everolimus-eluting stent systems and third-party reports of our average selling price of these stent systems. Amounts paid pursuant to this pricing arrangement are subject to a retroactive adjustment approximately every two years based on Abbott’s actual costs to manufacture these stent systems for us and our average selling price of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott. Our gross profit margin may be positively or negatively impacted in the future as a result of this adjustment process. We are currently reliant on Abbott for our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems in the U.S. and Japan. Our supply agreement with Abbott for everolimus-eluting stent systems in these regions extends through the end of the second quarter of 2012. At present, we believe that our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems from Abbott and our current launch plans for our next-generation internally-manufactured everolimus-eluting stent system is sufficient to meet customer demand. However, any production or capacity issues that affect Abbott’s manufacturing capabilities or our process for forecasting, ordering and receiving shipments may impact the ability to increase or decrease our level of supply in a timely manner; therefore, our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott may not align with customer demand, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. We expect to launch an internally developed and manufactured next-generation everolimus-eluting stent system, our PROMUS® Element™ stent system, in the U.S. and Japan in mid-2012. Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial end points. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market’s perception of these clinical data, may adversely impact our position in, and share of the drug-eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market. We believe that we can sustain our leadership position within the worldwide drug-eluting stent market for a variety of reasons, including: • our two drug-eluting stent platform strategy, including specialty stent sizes; • the broad and consistent long-term results of our TAXUS® clinical trials, and the favorable results of the XIENCE V®/PROMUS® stent system clinical trials to date; • the performance benefits of our current and future technology; • the strength of our pipeline of drug-eluting stent products, including our PROMUS® ElementÔ and TAXUS® ElementÔ stent systems; • our overall position in the worldwide interventional medicine market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force; and • the strength of our clinical, selling, marketing and manufacturing capabilities. However, a decline in net sales from our drug-eluting stent systems could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and operating cash flows. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug-eluting stent market and our position within this market include: 46 Table of Contents • our ability to successfully launch next-generation products and technology features, including the PROMUS® ElementÔ and TAXUS® ElementÔ stent systems; • the impact of competitive pricing pressure on average selling prices of drug-eluting stent systems available in the market; • the outcomes of on-going and future clinical results involving our products, including those sponsored by our competitors, or perceived product performance of our or our competitors’ products; • delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; • the outcome of intellectual property litigation; • changes in FDA clinical trial data and post-market surveillance requirements, as well as international regulatory requirements, and the associated impact on new product launch schedules and the cost of product approvals and compliance; and • physician and patient confidence in our current and next-generation technology, including drug-eluting stent technology; and • changes in drug-eluting stent penetration rates, the overall number of PCI procedures performed and average number of stents used per procedure. During 2009, we successfully negotiated closure of several long-standing legal matters, including multiple matters with Johnson & Johnson; all outstanding litigation between us and Medtronic, Inc. with respect to interventional cardiology and endovascular repair cases; and all outstanding litigation between us and Bruce Saffran, M.D., Ph.D. However, there continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market. In particular, although our recent settlements with Johnson & Johnson resolved 17 litigation matters, we continue to be involved in patent litigation with Johnson & Johnson relating to drug eluting stent delivery systems. We have each asserted that products of the other infringe patents owned or exclusively licensed by each of us. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operation or liquidity. See Note L- Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a description of these legal proceedings. Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) In addition to coronary stent systems, our Interventional Cardiology business markets balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures; as well as ultrasound imaging systems. Our worldwide net sales of these products decreased to $980 million in 2009, as compared to $1.028 billion in 2008, a decrease of $48 million or five percent. Our U.S. net sales represented $409 million in 2009, as compared to $461 million in the prior year, a decrease of $52 million or 11 percent. This decrease was the result of a delay in new product introductions, and competitive product launches, as well as the impact of product recalls associated with a third-party provider. Our international net sales of these products increased to $571 million in 2009, as compared to $567 million in 2008. Despite an overall decrease in our Interventional Cardiology net sales, we continue to hold a strong leadership position in the PTCA balloon catheter market with more than 50 percent share of the U.S. market, and are planning a number of additional new product launches during 2010, including the 47 Table of Contents Apex™ platinum pre-dilatation balloon catheter for improved radiopacity, the NC Quantum ApexÔ post-dilatation balloon catheter and the KinetixÔ family of guidewires. Peripheral Interventions Our Peripheral Interventions business product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, sheaths, wires and vena cava filters, which are used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease. Our worldwide net sales of these products decreased to $661 million in 2009, as compared to $684 million in 2008, a decrease of $23 million or three percent. Foreign currency exchange rates contributed a negative $10 million to our 2009 Peripheral Interventions net sales, as compared to the same period in the prior year. We believe that we are well positioned in the growing Peripheral Interventions market, due in part to the recent launches of our Carotid WALLSTENT® Monorail® Endoprosthesis for the treatment of patients with carotid artery disease who are at high risk for surgery; our Express® SD Renal Monorail® premounted stent system for use as an adjunct therapy to percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty in certain lesions of the renal arteries; and our Sterling® Monorail® and Over-the-Wire balloon dilatation catheter for use in the renal and lower extremity arteries. In addition, during the first quarter of 2010, we expect to receive FDA approval for an iliac indication for our Express® LD stent system. We believe that these product offerings will continue to provide positive momentum for our Peripheral Interventions business. Endoscopy Our Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. Our worldwide net sales of these products increased $63 million, or seven percent, to $1.006 billion in 2009, as compared to $943 million in 2008. Our U.S. net sales of these products increased $40 million to $517 million, as compared to the same period in the prior year, and our international net sales increased $23 million, despite an $11 million negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, to $489 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, our worldwide Endoscopy net sales increased eight percent in 2009, as compared to 2008. This increase was due primarily to higher net sales within our stent franchise, due largely to the U.S. launch of the WallFlex® biliary stent system and continued commercialization of the WallFlex® esophageal stent. In addition, our hemostasis franchise net sales benefited from increased utilization of our Resolution® Clip Device, an endoscopic mechanical clip to treat gastrointestinal bleeding, and our biliary franchise drove solid growth on the strength of our rapid exchange biliary devices. During 2010, we will continue the commercialization of our market-leading WallFlex® stent line; our DreamwireÔ high performance guidewire and DreamtomeÔ RX cannulating sphincterotome; as well as expanded sizes of our Radial® Jaw 4 biopsy forceps. Urology/Women’s Health Our Urology/Women’s Health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and gynecological disorders. Our worldwide net sales of these products increased $25 million, or six percent, to $456 million in 2009. Our U.S. net sales increased $18 million during 2009, as compared to the prior year, to $353 million, and our international net sales increased $7 million, as compared to 2008, to $103 million. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates, net sales of our Urology/Women’s Health products increased $27 million, or six percent, in 2009, as compared to 2008, and were negatively impacted by a July 2009 recall related to catheters used in our Prolieve Thermodilatation® System for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia. This recall had a negative impact of approximately $8 million resulting from estimated lost sales. The product issue that resulted in this recall has been corrected, and we re-launched the new catheter in November 2009. We do not expect that this recall will have a material future impact on our Urology/Women’s Health net sales. Our Women’s Health business grew approximately 19 percent in 2009, as compared to the prior year, on the strength of several new product launches, including our SolyxÔ single incision sling system and our UpholdÔ vaginal support system. In 48 Table of Contents addition, we executed two new Women’s Health product launches during 2009 with our second-generation ProCerva® Hydro ThermAblator® (HTA) procedure set, used in the treatment of excessive uterine bleeding, as well as our new Pinnacle® posterior pelvic floor repair kit. We expect these launches to continue to drive growth in our Women’s Health business. Neuromodulation Within our Neuromodulation business, we market the Precision® Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) system, used for the management of chronic pain. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products increased to $285 million for 2009, as compared to $245 million for 2008, an increase of $40 million or approximately 17 percent. Our U.S. net sales of Neuromodulation products were $271 million for 2009, as compared to $234 million in the prior year. We believe that we continue to have a technology advantage over our competitors with proprietary features such as Multiple Independent Current Control, which is intended to allow the physician to target specific areas of pain more precisely. As a demonstration of our commitment to strengthening clinical evidence with spinal cord stimulation, we are initiating a trial to assess the therapeutic effectiveness and cost effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation compared to reoperation in patients with failed back surgery syndrome. We believe that this trial could result in consideration of spinal cord stimulation much earlier in the continuum of care. In addition, we anticipate the launch of two new lead products during 2010. These factors, coupled with the move of our Neuromodulation business to a new state-of-the-art facility, position us well for continued growth in this market. Neurovascular We market a broad line of products used in treating diseases of the neurovascular system and hold leading market positions in several product markets. Our worldwide net sales of Neurovascular products decreased to $348 million in 2009, as compared to $360 million for 2008, a decrease of $12 million, or three percent, resulting primarily from new competitive launches and a delay in the launch of our next-generation products. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates contributed a negative $4 million to our worldwide Neurovascular sales in 2009, as compared to 2008. We plan to launch a next-generation family of detachable coils, including an enhanced delivery system designed to reduce coil detachment times, in the U.S. in 2010. Within our product pipeline, we are also developing next-generation technologies for the treatment of aneurysms, ICAD and acute ischemic stroke, and are involved in numerous clinical activities that are designed to expand the size of the worldwide Neurovascular market. Innovation Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we may obtain externally through strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our research and development efforts are focused largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. We expect to continue to invest in our core franchises and are also investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, areas including atrial fibrillation, underserved defibrillator populations, acute ischemic stroke, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, structural heart disease, vascular closure, hypertension, women’s health, endoluminal surgery, diabetes/obesity, endoscopic pulmonary intervention and deep brain stimulation. There can be no assurance that these technologies will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our future growth. We have historically entered strategic alliances with both publicly traded and privately held companies. We enter these alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets. During 2008, we monetized certain investments and alliances no longer determined to be strategic (see the Restructuring Initiatives section for more information). While we 49 Table of Contents believe our remaining strategic investments are within attractive markets with an outlook for sustained growth, the full benefit of these alliances is highly dependent on the strength of the other companies’ underlying technology and ability to execute. An inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings, or litigation related to these technologies, among other factors, may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these strategic alliances. Certain of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future. Any potential future acquisitions we consummate may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing, depending on their size and nature. Regulatory Compliance In January 2006, legacy Boston Scientific received a corporate warning letter from the FDA notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our facilities and advising us that our corporate-wide corrective action plan relating to three site-specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. We have identified solutions to the quality system issues cited by the FDA and have made significant progress in transitioning our organization to implement those solutions. During 2008, the FDA reinspected a number of our facilities and, in October 2008, informed us that our quality system is now in substantial compliance with its Quality System Regulations. The FDA has approved all of our requests for final approval of Class III product submissions previously on hold due to the corporate warning letter and is processing all requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFGs). In November of 2009 and January of 2010, the FDA reinspected two official action-indicated Boston Scientific sites to follow up on observations from the 2008 FDA inspections. Both of these FDA inspections confirmed that all issues at the sites have been resolved and all restrictions related to the corporate warning letter have been removed. The corporate warning letter remains in place pending FDA internal administrative procedures. During the first quarter of 2009, we acquired a third-party sterilization facility which was subject to a warning letter from the FDA. The FDA had requested documentation and explanations regarding various corrective actions related to the facility. This information was provided to the FDA and the FDA has since re-inspected the facility, issuing no observations, and subsequently removed all restrictions related to the warning letter. Other Governmental Matters Certain state governments have recently enacted, and the federal government has proposed, legislation aimed at increasing transparency in relationships between industry and health care professionals (HCPs). As a result, we are required by law to report many types of direct and indirect payments and other transfers of value to HCPs licensed by certain states and expect that we will have to make similar reports at the federal level in the near future. We are devoting substantial time and financial resources in order to develop and implement enhanced structure, policies, systems and processes in order to comply with these legal and regulatory requirements. Our new systems are designed to provide enhanced visibility and consistency across our businesses with respect to our interactions with health care professionals. Implementation of these policies, systems and processes, or failure to comply with these policies could have a negative impact our results of operations. Reimbursement and Funding Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers worldwide that typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed-care programs for the healthcare services provided to their patients. Third-party payors may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Reimbursement by third-party payors for these services is based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services’ 50 Table of Contents assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value. These reimbursement methodologies confer different, and sometimes conflicting, levels of financial risk and incentives to HCPs and patients, and these methodologies are subject to frequent refinements. Third-party payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. There can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by third-party payors, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third-party payors’ coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Accordingly, the outcome of these reimbursement decisions could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the current economic climate may impose further pressure on funds available for reimbursement of healthcare and on reimbursement levels. Manufacturing and Raw Materials We design and manufacture the majority of our products in technology centers around the world. Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources. Certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We also have an on-going program to identify single-source components and to develop alternative back-up supplies. However, in certain cases, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific components, materials or products, largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers. A reduction or interruption in supply, an inability to develop and validate alternative sources if required, or a significant increase in the price of raw materials, components or products could adversely affect our operations and financial condition, particularly materials or components related to our CRM products and drug-eluting stent systems. In addition, our products require sterilization prior to sale and we utilize a mix of internal resources and third party vendors to perform this service. To the extent our sterilizers are unable to process our products, whether due to raw material, capacity, regulatory or other constraints, we may be unable to transition to other providers in a timely manner, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. International Markets Our profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions, currency fluctuations, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development, rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy. Any significant changes in the competitive, political, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. International markets, including Japan, are affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs. Initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, are under way in many countries in which we do business. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as Japan, Europe and other international markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products and may influence a physician’s selection of products used to treat patients. We expect these practices to put increased pressure on reimbursement rates in these markets. In addition, most international jurisdictions have adopted regulatory approval and periodic renewal requirements for medical devices, and we must comply with these requirements in order to market our products in these jurisdictions. Further, some emerging markets rely on the FDA’s CFGs in lieu of their own regulatory approval requirements. Although the corporate warning letter has not been formally resolved, the FDA has approved all currently eligible requests for CFGs. However, any limits on our 51 Table of Contents ability to market our full line of existing products and to launch new products within these jurisdictions could have an adverse impact on our business. Results of Operations Net Sales We manage our international operating segments on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of currency exchange, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using current period currency exchange rates. The regional constant currency growth rates in the tables below can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note P — Segment Reporting to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We exclude net sales related to divested businesses from the net sales of our reportable segments. During the first quarter of 2009, we reorganized our international structure to provide more direct sales focus in the marketplace. Accordingly, we have revised our reportable segments to reflect the way we currently manage and view our business. As of December 31, 2009, we had four reportable segments based on geographic regions: the United States; EMEA, consisting of Europe, the Middle East and Africa; Japan; and Inter-Continental, consisting of Asia Pacific and the Americas. The reportable segments represent an aggregate of all operating divisions within each segment. We have reclassified previously reported segment results to be consistent with the 2009 presentation. The following table provides our worldwide net sales by region and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis: 2009 versus 2008 2008 versus 2007 As Reported Constant As Reported Constant Year Ended December 31, Currency Currency Currency Currency (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Basis Basis Basis Basis United States $ 4,675 $ 4,487 $ 4,522 4 % 4 % (1 )% (1 )% EMEA 1,837 1,960 1,833 (6 )% 1 % 7 % 2 % Japan 988 861 797 15 % 4 % 8 % (2 )% Inter-Continental 677 673 652 1 % 8 % 3 % (1 )% International 3,502 3,494 3,282 0 % 3 % 6 % 0 % Subtotal 8,177 7,981 7,804 2 % 4 % 2 % 0 % Divested businesses 11 69 553 N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide $ 8,188 $ 8,050 $ 8,357 2 % 3 % (4 )% (6 )% The following table provides our worldwide net sales by division and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis.

The increase was driven primarily by an increase in U.S. CRM group sales of $114 million and an increase of $47 million in U.S. sales of our coronary stent systems. In addition, U.S. sales in our Endosurgery group grew $58 million in 2009, as compared to the prior year, and our Neuromodulation division increased U.S. net sales $37 million. These increases were partially offset by declines in U.S. net sales from our Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) business of $52 million and a decrease of $16 million in Peripheral Interventions U.S. net sales in 2009, as compared to the prior year. Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for a more detailed discussion of our net sales by U.S. division. During 2008, our U.S. net sales, excluding net sales from divested businesses, decreased $35 million, or one percent, as compared to 2007. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in Cardiovascular division sales of $222 million, driven primarily by declines in sales of our drug-eluting stent systems as a result of increased competition. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in CRM product sales of $109 million, as a result of numerous successful product launches during 2008. In addition, U.S. sales in our Endosurgery division grew $43 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, driven by strength in our biliary and hemostasis franchises, and our Neuromodulation division increased sales by $36 million, due to market growth and continued physician adoption of our Precision Plus™ spinal cord stimulation technology. International Net Sales During 2009, our international net sales, excluding net sales from divested businesses, increased $8 million, or less than one percent, as compared to 2008. Foreign currency exchange rates contributed a negative $92 million to our international net sales, excluding divested businesses, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and net sales from divested businesses, net sales in our EMEA region increased $11 million, or one percent, in 2009, as compared the prior year. Our net sales in Japan increased $37 million, or four percent, excluding the impact of foreign 54 Table of Contents currency exchange rates and net sales from divested businesses, in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to an increase in coronary stent system sales following the launch of our second-generation TAXUS® Liberté® stent system in that region. Net sales in our Inter-Continental region, excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rates and net sales from divested businesses, increased $52 million, or eight percent, in 2009, as compared to the prior year, with the majority of our divisions and franchises contributing to the year over year growth. Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for a more detailed discussion of our net sales by division. During 2008, our international net sales, excluding net sales from divested businesses, increased $212 million, or six percent, as compared to 2007. The increase was attributable primarily to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates, which contributed $208 million to our international net sales, excluding sales from divested businesses. Within our international business, sales in our Cardiovascular division increased $77 million and CRM product sales increased $53 million. In addition, sales in our Endosurgery franchises increased $63 million in 2008, as compared to 2007. Gross Profit Our gross profit was $5.612 billion in 2009, $5.581 billion in 2008, and $6.015 billion in 2007. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit decreased to 68.5 percent in 2009, as compared to 69.3 percent in 2008 and 72.0 percent in 2007. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Gross profit — prior year 69.3 % 72.0 % Impact of shift in TAXUS®/ PROMUS® sales mix (1.4 )% (2.3 )% All other shifts in product sales mix (0.2 )% Net impact of foreign currency 0.9 % (0.5 )% Impact of higher inventory charges (0.4 )% Impact of lower Project Horizon spend 0.7 % All other (0.3 )% Gross profit — current year 68.5 % 69.3 % The primary factor contributing to a shift in product sales mix toward lower margin products in 2009, as compared to 2008, and 2008, as compared to 2007, was a decrease in sales of our higher margin TAXUS® drug-eluting stent systems. The shift in sales away from TAXUS® stent systems was due primarily to increased sales of the PROMUS® stent system in the U.S., following its July 2008 approval and launch. Sales of the PROMUS® stent system represented approximately 40 percent of our worldwide drug-eluting stent system sales in 2009, 19 percent in 2008, and two percent in 2007. Under the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit margin of a PROMUS® stent system, supplied to us by Abbott, is significantly lower than that of our TAXUS® stent system. Our gross profit margin for 2009, as compared to the prior year, was also positively impacted by 0.9 percentage points attributable to the settlement of foreign currency hedge contracts on intercompany and third party transactions. The settlement of these contracts had a negative impact on our gross profit margin of 0.5 percentage points in 2008, as compared to 2007. In addition, our gross profit margins decreased by 0.4 percentage points in 2008, as compared to 2007, due to increases in period expenses associated with inventory charges. Inventory and manufacturing equipment obsolescence charges in 2009 were relatively flat to 2008, and included approximately $40 million of inventory write-downs and manufacturing equipment obsolescence write-offs within our CRM division, related primarily to the resolution of a product advisory that resulted in the transition to a new version of our COGNIS® CRT-D and TELIGEN® ICD system product offerings. Further, our gross profit margin in 2008 benefited from lower spending associated with Project Horizon, our corporate-wide 55 Table of Contents initiative to improve and harmonize our overall quality processes and systems, which ended as a formal program as of December 31, 2007. Operating Expenses The following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses: 2009 2008 2007 % of Net % of Net % of Net (in millions) $ Sales $ Sales $ Sales Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,635 32.2 2,589 32.2 2,909 34.8 Research and development expenses 1,035 12.6 1,006 12.5 1,091 13.1 Royalty expense 191 2.3 203 2.5 202 2.4 Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses In 2009, our SG&A expenses increased by $46 million, or two percent, as compared to 2008. This increase was related primarily to the addition of direct selling expenses and head count, including expanding our global sales force and an increase in costs associated with various litigation-related matters. These increases were partially offset by a benefit from foreign currency exchange rates of approximately $22 million. As a percentage of net sales, our SG&A expenses were flat with 2008. In 2008, our SG&A expenses decreased by $320 million, or 11 percent, as compared to 2007. The decrease in our SG&A expenses related primarily to lower head count and spending resulting from our 2007 Restructuring plan, as well as a reduction of $160 million attributable to our first quarter 2008 divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses. Refer to the Restructuring Initiatives section for more discussion of these initiatives. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses Our investment in R&D reflects spending on new product development programs, as well as regulatory compliance and clinical research. In 2009, our R&D expenses increased $29 million, or three percent, as compared to 2008. As a percentage of net sales, our R&D expenses in 2009 were relatively flat with 2008. We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that will contribute to our short- and long-term profitable sales growth. In 2008, our R&D expenses decreased by $85 million, or eight percent, as compared to 2007. As a percentage of our net sales, R&D expenses decreased to 12.5 percent in 2008 from 13.1 percent in 2007. The decrease related primarily to lower head count and spending of $75 million resulting from our first quarter 2008 divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses. Royalty Expense In 2009, our royalty expense decreased $12 million, or six percent, as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in royalty expense of $29 million attributable to the expiration of a CRM royalty agreement during the first quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in royalty expense of $20 million as a result of an increase in sales of our drug-eluting stent systems, as well as the shift in the mix of our drug-eluting stent system sales towards the PROMUS® stent system, following its launch in the U.S. in mid-2008. The royalty rate applied to sales of the PROMUS® stent system is, on average, higher than that associated with sales of our TAXUS® stent system. In 2008, our royalty expense increased by $1 million, or less than one percent, as compared to 2007. As a percentage of our net sales, royalty expense increased slightly to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent for 2007. 56 Table of Contents Royalty expense attributable to sales of our drug-eluting stent systems increased $8 million as compared to 2007, despite an overall decrease in drug-eluting stent system sales. This was due to a shift in the mix of our drug-eluting stent system sales towards the PROMUS® stent system. Offsetting this increase was a decrease in royalty expense of $6 million attributable to our first quarter 2008 divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses. Loss on Program Termination In the second quarter of 2009, we cancelled one of our internal R&D programs in order to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $16 million, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards CodificationÔ (ASC) Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations (formerly FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities), associated with future payments that we believe we remain contractually obligated to make. We continue to focus on developing new technologies that will contribute to profitable sales growth in the future and do not believe that the cancellation of this program will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. Amortization Expense Our amortization expense was $511 million in 2009, as compared to $543 million in 2008, a decrease of $32 million or six percent. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of certain Interventional Cardiology-related intangible assets reaching the end of their accounting useful life during 2008, as well as the write-down of certain intangible assets to their fair values in 2009 and 2008, described in Other Intangible Asset Impairment Charges below. Our amortization expense was $543 million in 2008, as compared to $620 million in 2007, a decrease of $77 million, or 12 percent. The decrease in our amortization expense related primarily to the disposal of $581 million of amortizable intangible assets in connection with our first quarter 2008 business divestitures, and to certain Interventional Cardiology-related intangible assets reaching the end of their accounting useful life. Goodwill Impairment Charges In 2008, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $2.613 billion associated with our acquisition of Guidant Corporation. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note E -Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. Other Intangible Asset Impairment Charges In 2009, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $12 million, associated primarily with lower than anticipated market penetration of one of our Urology technology offerings. We do not believe that these impairments will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note E -Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. In 2008, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $177 million, including a $131 million write-down of certain of our Peripheral Interventions-related intangible assets, and a $46 million write-down of certain Urology-related intangible assets. We do not believe that the write-down of these assets will have a material impact on future operations or cash flows. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note E -Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. 57 Table of Contents In 2007, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $21 million associated with our acquisition of Advanced Stent Technologies (AST), due to our decision to suspend further significant funding with respect to the Petal™ bifurcation stent. We do not expect this decision to materially impact our future operations or cash flows. Refer to Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note E -Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. Acquisition-related Milestone In connection with Abbott’s 2006 acquisition of Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, Abbott agreed to pay us a milestone payment of $250 million upon receipt of FDA approval to sell an everolimus-eluting stent in the U.S. In July 2008, Abbott received FDA approval and launched its XIENCE V® everolimus-eluting coronary stent system in the U.S., and paid us $250 million, which we recorded as a gain in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Under the terms of the agreement, we were also entitled to receive a second milestone payment of $250 million from Abbott upon receipt of an approval from the Japanese MHLW to market the XIENCE V® stent system in Japan. The MHLW approved the XIENCE V® stent system in the first quarter in 2010 and we subsequently received the milestone payment from Abbott, which we will record as a gain in our financial statements for the quarter ending March 31, 2010. Purchased Research and Development As of January 1, 2009, we adopted FASB Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations (codified within ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations), a replacement for Statement No. 141. Additionally, Statement No. 141(R) superseded FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date. Statement No. 141(R) (Topic 805) requires that purchased research and development acquired in a business combination be recognized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. During 2009, we did not consummate any material business combinations. For any future business combinations that we enter, we will recognize purchased research and development as an intangible asset. Our policy is to record certain costs associated with strategic alliances as purchased research and development. Our adoption of Statement No. 141(R) (Topic 805) did not change this policy with respect to asset purchases. In accordance with this policy, during 2009, we recorded purchased research and development charges of $21 million in conjunction with entering certain licensing and development arrangements. Since the 2009 technology purchases did not involve the transfer of processes or outputs as defined by Statement No. 141(R) (Topic 805), the transactions did not qualify as business combinations. In 2008, we recorded $43 million of purchased research and development charges, including $17 million associated with our acquisition of Labcoat, Ltd., $8 million attributable to our acquisition of CryoCor, Inc., and $18 million associated with entering certain licensing and development arrangements. The in-process research and development associated with our acquisition of Labcoat, Ltd. related to a novel technology Labcoat is developing for coating drug-eluting stents. The in-process research and development associated with CryoCor represents cryogenic technology for use in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, the most common and difficult to treat cardiac arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat). We intend to use this technology in order to further pursue therapeutic solutions for atrial fibrillation and advance our existing CRM and Electrophysiology product lines. In 2007, we recorded $85 million of purchased research and development, including $75 million associated with our acquisition of Remon Medical Technologies, Inc., $13 million resulting from the application of equity method accounting for one of our strategic investments, and $12 million associated 58 Table of Contents with payments made for certain early-stage CRM technologies. Additionally, in June 2007, we terminated our product development agreement with Aspect Medical Systems relating to brain monitoring technology that Aspect was developing to aid the diagnosis and treatment of depression, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological conditions. As a result, we recognized a credit to purchased research and development of approximately $15 million during 2007, representing future payments that we would have been obligated to make prior to the termination of the agreement. We do not expect the termination of the agreement to impact our future operations or cash flows materially. The in-process research and development acquired with Remon consists of a pressure-sensing system development project, which we intend to combine with our existing CRM devices. As of December 31, 2009, we estimate that the total cost to complete the development project is between $75 million and $80 million. We expect to launch devices using pressure-sensing technology in 2013 in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries, in the U.S. in 2016, and Japan in 2017, subject to regulatory approvals. We expect material net cash inflows from such products to commence in 2016, following the launch of this technology in the U.S. Gain on Divestitures During 2008, we recorded a $250 million gain in connection with the sale of our Fluid Management and Venous Access businesses and our TriVascular EVAR program. Refer to the Restructuring Initiatives section and Note F — Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these transactions. Loss on Assets Held for Sale During 2007, we recorded a $560 million loss attributable primarily to the write-down of goodwill in connection with the sale of certain of our non-strategic businesses. Refer to the Restructuring Initiatives section and Note F — Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these transactions. Restructuring In October 2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count reduction plan (the 2007 Restructuring plan), which resulted in the elimination of approximately 2,300 positions worldwide. We are providing affected employees with severance packages, outplacement services and other appropriate assistance and support. The plan is intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short- and long-term shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the restructuring of several businesses, corporate functions and product franchises in order to better utilize resources, strengthen competitive positions, and create a more simplified and efficient business model; the elimination, suspension or reduction of spending on certain research and development projects; and the transfer of certain production lines among facilities. We initiated these activities in the fourth quarter of 2007. The transfer of production lines contemplated under the 2007 Restructuring plan will continue throughout 2010; all other major activities under the plan were completed as of December 31, 2009. We expect that the execution of this plan will result in total pre-tax expenses of approximately $425 million to $435 million. We have recorded related costs of $407 million since the inception of the plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. We expect the plan to result in cash payments of approximately $375 million to $385 million, of which we have made payments of $330 million to date. The following provides a summary of our expected total costs associated with the plan by major type of cost: 59 Table of Contents Total estimated amount expected to Type of cost be incurred Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $205 million to $210 million Fixed asset write-offs $31 million Other (1) $65 million Restructuring-related expenses: Retention incentives $66 million Accelerated depreciation $18 million Transfer costs (2) $40 million to $45 million $425 million to $435 million (1) Consists primarily of consulting fees, contractual cancellations, relocation costs and other costs. (2) Consists primarily of costs to transfer product lines among facilities, including costs of transfer teams, freight and product line validations. As a result of the execution of our 2007 Restructuring plan and our divestiture-related initiatives, we reduced research and development and SG&A expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately $500 million exiting 2008. In addition, we expect annualized run-rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $35 million to $40 million as a result of our transfers of production lines. Due to the longer-term nature of these initiatives, we do not expect to achieve the full benefit of these reductions in manufacturing costs until 2012. We have partially reinvested our savings from these initiatives into targeted head count increases, primarily in customer-facing positions, to drive future sales growth. In addition, in January 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a Plant Network Optimization program, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The program is a complement to our 2007 Restructuring plan, and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2011. We estimate that the program will result in annual reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65 million to $80 million in 2012. These savings are in addition to the estimated $35 million to $40 million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs in 2012 from activities under our 2007 Restructuring plan. We expect that the execution of the Plant Network Optimization program will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $135 million to $150 million, and that approximately $115 million to $125 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays. The following provides a summary of our estimates of costs associated with the Plant Network Optimization program by major type of cost: Total estimated amount expected to Type of cost be incurred Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $40 million to $45 million Restructuring-related expenses: Accelerated depreciation $20 million to $25 million Transfer costs (1) $75 million to $80 million $135 million to $150 million (1) Consists primarily of costs to transfer product lines among facilities, including costs of transfer teams, freight, idle facility and product line validations. 60 Table of Contents We recorded restructuring charges of $63 million in 2009, $78 million in 2008 and $176 million in 2007. In addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of our accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $67 million in 2009, $55 million in 2008, and $8 million in 2007. The following presents these costs by major type and line item within our accompanying consolidated statements of operations: Year Ended December 31, 2009 Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write-offs Other Total Restructuring charges $ 34 $ 13 $ 16 $ 63 Restructuring-related expenses: Cost of products sold $ 5 $ 8 $ 37 50 Selling, general and administrative expenses 10 3 1 14 Research and development expenses 3 3 18 11 37 1 67 $ 34 $ 18 $ 11 $ 37 $ 13 $ 17 $ 130 Year Ended December 31, 2008 Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write-offs Other Total Restructuring charges $ 34 $ 10 $ 34 $ 78 Restructuring-related expenses: Cost of products sold $ 9 $ 4 $ 4 $ 17 Selling, general and administrative expenses 27 4 31 Research and development expenses 7 7 $ 43 $ 8 $ 4 $ 55 $ 34 $ 43 $ 8 $ 4 $ 10 $ 34 $ 133 Year Ended December 31, 2007 Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write-offs Other Total Restructuring charges $ 158 $ 8 $ 10 $ 176 Restructuring-related expenses: Cost of products sold $ 1 $ 1 $ 2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 2 2 4 Research and development expenses 2 2 $ 5 $ 3 $ 8 $ 158 $ 5 $ 3 $ 8 $ 10 $ 184 Restructuring and restructuring-related costs recorded in 2008 and 2007 relate entirely to our 2007 Restructuring plan. Costs recorded in 2009 by plan were as follows: Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write-offs Other Total 2007 Restructuring plan $ 12 $ 18 $ 5 $ 25 $ 13 $ 17 $ 90 Plant Network Optimization program 22 6 12 40 $ 34 $ 18 $ 11 $ 37 $ 13 $ 17 $ 130 Termination benefits represent amounts incurred pursuant to our on-going benefit arrangements and amounts for “one-time” involuntary termination benefits, and have been recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 712, Compensation — Non-retirement Postemployment Benefits (formerly FASB Statement No. 112, Employer’s Accounting for Postemployment Benefits) and ASC Topic 420 — Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations (formerly FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities). We expect to record the additional termination benefits in 2010 when we identify with more specificity the job classifications, functions and locations of the remaining head count to be eliminated. Retention 61 Table of Contents incentives represent cash incentives, which are being recorded over the service period during which eligible employees must remain employed with us in order to retain the payment. Other restructuring costs, which represent primarily consulting fees, are being recognized and measured at their fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred in accordance with Topic 420. Accelerated depreciation is being recorded over the adjusted remaining useful life of the related assets, and production line transfer costs are being recorded as incurred. We have incurred cumulative restructuring charges of $317 million and restructuring-related costs of $130 million since we committed to each plan. The following presents these costs by major type and by plan: 2007 Plant Restructuring Network (in millions) Plan Optimization Total Termination benefits $ 204 $ 22 $ 226 Fixed asset write-offs 31 31 Other 60 60 Total restructuring charges 295 22 $ 317 Retention incentives 66 66 Accelerated depreciation 16 6 22 Transfer costs 29 12 41 Other 1 1 Restructuring-related expenses 112 18 130 $ 407 $ 40 $ 447 In 2009, we made cash payments of approximately $100 million associated with restructuring initiatives pursuant to our 2007 Restructuring plan, which related to termination benefits, production line transfer costs and other restructuring costs. We have made cumulative cash payments of approximately $330 million since we committed to the 2007 Restructuring plan. These payments were made using cash generated from our operations. We expect to record the remaining costs associated with the 2007 Restructuring plan through 2010, and make future cash payments throughout 2010 using cash generated from operations. In 2009, since the inception of our Plant Network Optimization program, we have made associated cash payments of $12 million. These payments were made using cash generated from our operations. We expect to record the remaining costs associated with the Plant Network Optimization program through 2011, and make future cash payments through 2012 using cash generated from operations. Further, on February 6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to strengthen and position us for long-term success. We estimate that the execution of this plan will result in reductions in pre-tax operating expenses of approximately $200 million to $250 million, once completed in 2011. We will reinvest a portion of the savings into customer facing and other activities to help drive future sales growth and support the business. Key activities under the plan include the integration of our Cardiovascular and CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions; the centralization of our R&D organization; the re-alignment of our international structure, and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio, in order to drive innovation, accelerate profitable growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan will be initiated in early 2010 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2011. We estimate that the 2010 Restructuring plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $180 million to $200 million, and that approximately $170 million to $190 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays. We expect the execution of the plan will result in the elimination of approximately 62 Table of Contents 1,000 to 1,300 positions by the end of 2011. The following provides a summary of our expected total costs associated with the plan by major type of cost: Type of Cost Total Expected Amounts Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $115 million to $125 million Asset write-offs $5 million Other (1) $35 million to $40 million Restructuring-related expenses: Other (2) $25 million to $30 million $180 million to $200 million (1) Includes primarily consulting fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations (2) Comprised of other costs directly related to restructuring plan, including accelerated depreciation and infrastructure-related costs Litigation-Related Charges We record certain significant litigation-related activity as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations. In 2009, we recorded litigation-related charges of $2.022 billion, associated primarily with an agreement to settle three patent disputes with Johnson & Johnson for $1.725 billion, plus interest. In addition, in November 2009, we reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice to pay $296 million in order to resolve the U.S. Government investigation of Guidant Corporation related to product advisories issued in 2005. Further, during 2009, we recorded charges of $50 million associated with the settlement of all outstanding litigation with Bruce Saffran, and reduced previously recorded reserves associated with certain litigation-related matters following certain favorable court rulings, resulting in a credit of $60 million. In 2008, we recorded litigation-related charges of $334 million as a result of a ruling by a federal judge in a patent infringement case brought against us by Johnson & Johnson, and, in 2007, recorded litigation-related charges of $365 million, associated with this case. Each of these matters is discussed in Note L — Commitments and Contingencies to our 2009 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Interest Expense Our interest expense decreased to $407 million in 2009, as compared to $468 million in 2008. The decrease in our interest expense was a result of a decrease in our average debt levels, due to term loan prepayments during 2009. Partially offsetting these decreases were losses of $27 million associated with the early termination of interest rate contracts for which there was no longer an underlying exposure following the prepayment of our remaining term loan debt obligations, the write-off of $7 million of debt issuance costs following the prepayment of our term loan, and a slight increase in our average borrowing rate. Our average borrowing rate was 6.1 percent in 2009 and 6.0 percent in 2008. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section and Note I — Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations. Our interest expense decreased to $468 million in 2008 as compared to $570 million in 2007. The decrease in our interest expense related primarily to a decrease in our average debt levels, due to debt prepayments of $1.425 billion during the year, as well as a decrease in our average borrowing rate. Our average borrowing rate was 6.0 percent for 2008 and 6.3 percent in 2007. 63 Table of Contents Other, net Our other, net reflected expense of $7 million in 2009, expense of $58 million in 2008, and income of $15 million in 2007. The following are the components of other, net: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 7 $ 47 $ 79 Foreign currency (losses) gains (5 ) 5 17 Net gains (losses) on investments and notes receivable 3 (93 ) (54 ) Fair value adjustment for sharing of proceeds feature of the Abbott Laboratories stock purchase (8 ) Other expense, net (12 ) (17 ) (19 ) $ (7 ) $ (58 ) $ 15 Other, net included interest income of $7 million in 2009, $47 million in 2008, and $79 million in 2007. Our interest income decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, and in 2008, as compared to 2007, due primarily to lower average investment rates available in the market, as well as lower average cash balances. In addition, other, net included net gains of $3 million in 2009, and net losses of $93 million in 2008 and $54 million in 2007, associated with our investment portfolio. These gains and losses relate primarily to the sale of our non-strategic investments, described in Note G- Divestitures to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. In connection with our 2006 acquisition of Guidant Corporation and related transaction with Abbott Laboratories, Abbott was required to sell its shares of our common stock and apply a portion of the net proceeds from its sale of these shares in excess of specified amounts, if any, to reduce the principal amount of the loan granted to us from Abbott as part of the Guidant transaction. We recorded the fair value of this ‘sharing of proceeds’ feature, determined using a Monte Carlo simulation methodology, as of the acquisition date and revalued the instrument each subsequent reporting period. As a result, we recorded net expense of $8 million during 2007 to reflect a decrease in fair value resulting from changes in our stock price, among other factors. There was no fair value associated with this feature as of December 31, 2009 or 2008, and all underlying shares of our common stock have been sold by Abbott. Tax Rate The following provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) 2009 2008 2009 2008 2007 vs. 2008 vs. 2007 Reported tax rate (21.6 )% 0.2 % (13.0 )% (21.8 )% 13.2 % Impact of certain charges 39.1 % 18.9 % 25.6 % 20.2 % (6.7 )% In 2009, the decrease in our reported tax rate, as compared to 2008, related primarily to the impact of certain items that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. In 2009, these amounts included litigation-related net charges, intangible asset impairment charges, purchased research and development and restructuring-related charges, as well as a favorable tax ruling on a divestiture-related gain recognized in a prior period. In 2008, the increase in our reported tax rate, as compared to 2007, related primarily to the impact of certain charges and gains that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These amounts related primarily to gains and losses associated with the divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses and investments, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, litigation-related charges, and changes in the geographic mix of our net sales. 64 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2009, we had $1.038 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which a net $885 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As of December 31, 2008, we had $1.107 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, of which a net $945 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. We have concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through 2000 and substantially all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters through 2001. During 2009, we received the Revenue Agent’s Report for our federal tax examination covering years 2004 and 2005, which contained proposed adjustments, related primarily to transfer pricing and transaction-related issues. We agreed on certain adjustments and made associated payments of $64 million, inclusive of interest. We disagree with certain positions contained in the Report and intend to contest these positions through applicable IRS and judicial procedures, as appropriate. We also continue to disagree with and contest the significant proposed adjustment, related primarily to the allocation of income between our US and foreign affiliates, contained in the Revenue Agent’s Report received in 2008 for Guidant’s federal tax examination covering years 2001 through 2003. Although the final resolution associated with these matters is uncertain, we believe that our income tax reserves are adequate and that the resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. During 2009, the Obama administration announced several legislative proposals to reform the United States tax rules, including provisions that may limit the deferral of United States income tax on our unremitted earnings, reduce or eliminate our ability to claim foreign tax credits, and eliminate various tax deductions until foreign earnings are repatriated to the U.S. If any of these proposals are enacted into law, they could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following provides a summary and description of our cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash provided by operating activities $ 835 $ 1,216 $ 934 Cash (used for) provided by investing activities (793 ) 324 (474 ) Cash used for financing activities (820 ) (1,350 ) (680 ) Operating Activities Cash generated by our operating activities continues to be a major source of funds for servicing our outstanding debt obligations and investing in our growth. The decrease in our operating cash flow in 2009, as compared to 2008, is due primarily to litigation-related payments of $823 million, associated primarily with patent litigation with Johnson & Johnson. Refer to Note L — Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for discussion of our legal proceedings. These cash outflows were partially offset by lower net tax payments of $370 million; and lower interest payments of $50 million, due to lower average debt balances, as well as improvements in working capital, particularly the strong collection of accounts receivable. The increase in operating cash flow in 2008, as compared to 2007, is due primarily to the receipt of a $250 million milestone payment from Abbott following the July 2008 FDA approval of the XIENCE V® everolimus-eluting coronary stent system. In addition, we made lower interest payments of $129 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, due to lower average debt balances. These increases were partially offset by $187 million of payments made in 2008 towards the Guidant multi-district litigation (MDL) settlement, described in Note L. 65 Table of Contents Investing Activities During 2009, our investing activities included $523 million of payments related to prior period acquisitions, comprised primarily of a final fixed payment of approximately $500 million related to our prior period acquisition of Advanced Bionics Corporation, described in Note D — Acquisitions to our accompanying consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Our investing activities in 2009 also included payments for investments in privately held companies, and acquisitions of businesses and certain technology rights of $54 million, which were offset by proceeds from the sale of investments in, and collection of notes receivable from, certain publicly traded and privately held companies, of $91 million. Further, we made capital expenditures of $312 million during 2009. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately $350 million to $400 million during 2010, which includes capital expenditures to further upgrade our quality systems and information systems infrastructure, and to enhance our manufacturing capabilities to support continued growth in our business units. During 2008, our investing activities included proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion associated with the divestiture of certain businesses, $149 million of proceeds associated with the sale of investments and collections of notes receivable. These cash inflows were partially offset by $675 million in payments related to prior period acquisitions, associated primarily with Advanced Bionics; and $39 million of net cash payments for investments in privately held companies, and acquisitions of certain technology rights. In addition, we paid $21 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire CryoCor, Inc. and $17 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire Labcoat, Ltd. Refer to Note G — Investments and Notes Receivable and Note D — Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. Further, our 2008 investing activities included capital expenditures of $362 million. During 2007, our investing activities included $248 million of payments related to prior period acquisitions, associated primarily with Advanced Bionics; and $53 million of cash payments for investments in privately held companies, and acquisitions of certain technology rights. Further, we paid approximately $70 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire Remon Medical Technologies, Inc. We also issued approximately five million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $90 million and paid $10 million in cash, in addition to our previous investments of $40 million, to acquire the remaining interests of EndoTex Interventional Systems, Inc. These cash outflows were partially offset by $243 million of gross proceeds from the sale of several of our investments in, and collection of notes receivable from, certain privately held and publicly traded companies. Refer to Note G — Investments and Notes Receivable and Note D — Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. Further, our 2007 investing activities included capital expenditures of $363 million. Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt and proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs. Debt In 2009, we issued $2.0 billion of senior notes and received net proceeds of $1.972 billion. We used these proceeds, as well as cash generated from operations, to prepay all $2.825 billion remaining under our term loan. We also prepaid $1.175 billion of our term loan debt in 2008. The following is a summary of our net debt4 position as of December 31, 2009 and 2008: 4 Management uses net debt to monitor and evaluate cash and debt levels and believes it is a measure that provides valuable information regarding our net financial position and interest rate exposure. Users of our financial statements should consider this non-GAAP financial information in addition to, not as a substitute for, nor as superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 66 Table of Contents As of December 31, (in millions) 2009 2008 Short-term debt $ 3 $ 2 Long-term debt 5,915 6,743 Total debt 5,918 6,745 Less: cash and cash equivalents 864 1,641 Net debt $ 5,054 $ 5,104 Equity During 2009, we received $33 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $71 million in 2008 and $132 million in 2007. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees. We did not repurchase any of our common stock during 2009, 2008 or 2007. Approximately 37 million shares remain under our previous share repurchase authorizations. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2009. See Note D — Acquisitions and Note I — Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2009 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information regarding our acquisition and debt obligations. Payments Due by Period (in millions) 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total Litigation settlements $ 1,299 750 $ 2,049 Long-term debt obligations 1,750 600 3,600 5,950 Operating lease obligations (1) 76 68 52 36 22 62 316 Purchase obligations (1)(2) 364 27 20 3 1 1 416 Minimum royalty obligations (1) 28 15 3 1 1 5 53 Unrecognized tax benefits 101 101 Interest payments (1) 290 292 245 245 228 1,493 2,793 $ 2,158 $ 2,902 $ 320 $ 285 $ 852 $ 5,161 $ 11,678 (1) In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. (2) These obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.236 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note K— Income Taxes to our 2009 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits. 67 Table of Contents Certain of our acquisitions involve the payment of contingent consideration. See Note D - Acquisitions to our 2009 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with our recent acquisitions. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, performance milestones will be reached, or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues, the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above. Additionally, we may consider satisfying these commitments by issuing our stock or refinancing the commitments with cash, including cash obtained through the sale of our stock. Certain of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, we will exercise our option to acquire these companies, we have not included these future potential payments in the table above. During the first quarter of 2010, we reached an agreement to settle three patent disputes with Johnson & Johnson for $1.725 billion, plus interest. We paid $1.000 billion, consisting of $800 million of cash on hand and $200 million borrowed from our revolving credit facility, during the first quarter of 2010 and will satisfy the remaining obligation on or before January 3, 2011. In addition, during the first half of 2011, $1.750 billion of our outstanding debt obligations, as well as our revolving credit facility, will mature. We expect to refinance the majority of our 2011 debt maturities and revolving credit facility by mid-2010. As of December 31, 2009, we had outstanding letters of credit of $123 million, as compared to $819 million as of December 31, 2008, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers’ compensation programs. The decrease is due primarily to the payment of $716 million to Johnson & Johnson during 2009 and the termination of an associated letter of credit. In February 2010, we posted a $745 million letter of credit under our $1.750 billion revolving credit facility as collateral for the future Johnson and Johnson obligation discussed above, which reduces availability under the facility by the same amount. See Note L — Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a description of these legal proceedings. As of December 31, 2009, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees, and, as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had accrued the Johnson & Johnson obligations in our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, we have not recognized a related liability for our outstanding letters of credit in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2009 or 2008. We believe we will generate sufficient cash from operations to fund these payments without drawing on the letters of credit. We also maintain a $350 million credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. As of December 31, 2009, we had $54 million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility. There were no other amounts borrowed under these facilities as of December 31, 2009 or December 31, 2008. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). We describe these accounting polices in Note A—Significant Accounting Policies to our 2009 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. 68 Table of Contents We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring management’s judgment that we consider critical: Revenue Recognition We generate revenue primarily from the sale of single-use medical devices, and present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations. We consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. We generally meet these criteria at the time of shipment, unless a consignment arrangement exists or we are required to provide additional services. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, or implant, which indicates that the sale is complete. For our other transactions, we recognize revenue when our products are delivered and risk of loss transfers to the customer, provided there are no substantive remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance, and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns. For multiple-element arrangements where the sale of devices is combined with future service obligations, as with our LATITUDE® Patient Management System, we defer revenue on the undelivered element based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value and using the residual method of allocation, and recognize the associated revenue over the related service period. We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings; for these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. We offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. We have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices. We recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above. Warranty Obligations We estimate the costs that we may incur under our warranty programs based on historical experience. We record a liability equal to the costs to repair or otherwise satisfy the claim as cost of products sold at the time the product sale occurs. Factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of units sold, the historical and anticipated rates of warranty claims and the cost per claim. We assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities on a quarterly basis and adjust the amounts as necessary. Inventory Provisions We base our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess and obsolete inventory in the future. The industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product 69 Table of Contents launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess and obsolete inventory. Valuation of Business Combinations We record intangible assets acquired in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition, including identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated cash flows and discount rates, and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations, amounts for purchased research and development, and intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods. As of January 1, 2009, we adopted FASB Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations (codified within ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations). Pursuant to the guidance in Statement No. 141(R) (Topic 805), in those circumstances where an acquisition involves contingent consideration, we would recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the contingent payment at the acquisition date. For acquisitions consummated prior to January 1, 2009, we will continue to record contingent consideration as an additional element of cost of the acquired entity when the contingency is resolved and consideration is issued or becomes issuable. Purchased Research and Development Our purchased research and development represents the value of acquired in-process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. Through December 31, 2008 we expensed the value attributable to these in-process projects at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accounting standards effective through that date. As discussed above, as of January 1, 2009, we adopted FASB Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations (codified within ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations), a replacement for Statement No. 141. Statement No. 141(R) also superseded FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date. Statement No. 141(R) (Topic 805) requires that purchased research and development acquired in a business combination be recognized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. During 2009, we did not consummate any material business combinations. For any future business combinations that we enter, we will recognize purchased research and development as an intangible asset. In addition, we record certain costs associated with strategic alliances as purchased research and development. Our adoption of Statement No. 141(R) (Topic 805) did not change this policy with respect to asset purchases. We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, 70 Table of Contents expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among other factors: the in-process projects’ stage of completion; the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date; the costs already incurred; the projected costs to complete; the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets; the expected introduction date; and the estimated useful life of the technology. We base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors. For the in-process projects acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, we used risk-adjusted discount rates of 34 percent in 2008 and 19 percent in 2007 to discount our projected cash flows. We believe that the estimated in-process research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects. However, if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisition as a whole. Impairment of Intangible Assets We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product recall, or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. For purposes of the recoverability test, we group our amortizable intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of the intangible asset (asset group) exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset (asset group), we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified. To test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we calculate the fair value of these assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value. We generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset (asset group). The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. See Note E — Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets for more information related to impairment of intangible assets during 2009, 2008 and 2007. For patents developed internally, we capitalize costs incurred to obtain patents, including attorney fees, registration fees, consulting fees, and other expenditures directly related to securing the patent. Legal costs incurred in connection with the successful defense of both internally developed patents and those obtained through our acquisitions are capitalized and amortized over the remaining amortizable life of the related patent. Goodwill Impairment We test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the assessment, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (formerly FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets). The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of 71 Table of Contents these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. For our April 1, 2009 annual impairment assessment, we identified our reporting units to be our six U.S. operating segments, which in aggregate make up the U.S. reportable segment, and our four international operating segments. When allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition. In addition, for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets, which relate to a reporting unit’s operations, and would be considered in determining its fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit. During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessment. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting units. In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market participant risk-adjusted weighted-average costs of capital (WACC) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units’ future expected cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value. If we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated, we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate. We would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods, once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test and recorded a $2.613 billion goodwill impairment charge associated with our acquisition of Guidant Corporation. As a result of economic conditions and the related increase in volatility in the equity and credit markets, which became more pronounced starting in the fourth quarter of 2008, our estimated risk-adjusted WACC increased 150 basis points from 9.5 percent during our 2008 72 Table of Contents second quarter annual goodwill impairment assessment to 11.0 percent during our 2008 fourth quarter interim impairment assessment. This change, along with reductions in market demand for products in our U.S. CRM reporting unit relative to our assumptions at the time of the Guidant acquisition, were the key factors contributing to the impairment charge. Our estimated market participant WACC decreased 50 basis points from 11.0 percent during our 2008 fourth quarter interim impairment assessment to 10.5 percent during our 2009 second quarter annual goodwill impairment assessment, and our other significant assumptions remained largely consistent. Our 2009 goodwill impairment test did not identify any reporting units whose carrying values exceeded implied fair values. The majority of our reporting units do not have a material amount of goodwill that is at risk of failing a future impairment test. While we do not believe there are indicators of impairment as of December 31, 2009 to necessitate the performance of an interim impairment test, we have considered current and future expected economic conditions as of year end and, as a result, we have identified two reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the impairment test in future reporting periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM group and EMEA region, each to which we have allocated a significant portion of the goodwill associated with our 2006 acquisition of Guidant Corporation. The aggregate amount of goodwill allocated to these reporting units was approximately $7.4 billion as of December 31, 2009. For each of these reporting units, the level of excess fair value over carrying value exceeded 25 percent as of our second quarter 2009 impairment assessment. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The key variables that drive the fair value of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates and discount rate assumptions. Future events that could have a negative effect on the fair value of the reporting units include, but are not limited to: • decreases in estimated market sizes due to pricing pressures and the underlying health of local economies; • declines in our market share and penetration assumptions due to increased competition, an inability to launch new products, and market and/or regulatory conditions that may cause significant launch delays or product recalls; • negative developments in current and future intellectual property litigation that may impact our ability to market certain products; • increases in the research and development costs necessary to obtain regulatory approvals and launch new products, and the level of success of future research and development efforts; • legislative and administrative reforms, which may impact the healthcare industry, and could negatively impact our future selling prices, operating costs and taxes we may be obligated to pay; and • increases in our risk-adjusted WACC due to further instability or deterioration of the equity and credit markets. Changes in one or more of the factors outlined above could present a situation whereby it may be reasonably likely that an impairment may occur over the next twelve months in our U.S. CRM and EMEA reporting units. Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse. We had net deferred tax liabilities of $1.281 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $1.351 billion as of December 31, 2008. Gross deferred tax liabilities of $2.445 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $2.696 73 Table of Contents billion as of December 31, 2008 relate primarily to intangible assets acquired in connection with our prior acquisitions. Gross deferred tax assets of $1.164 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $1.345 billion as of December 31, 2008 relate primarily to the establishment of inventory and product-related reserves, litigation and product liability reserves, purchased research and development, investment write-downs, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. In light of our historical financial performance and the extent of our deferred tax liabilities, we believe we will recover substantially all of these assets. As of January 1, 2009, we adopted FASB Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations, (codified within ASC Topic 805) which requires that we recognize changes in acquired income tax uncertainties (applied to acquisitions before and after the adoption date) as income tax expense or benefit. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years. We do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations. It is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested offshore are $9.355 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $9.327 billion as of December 31, 2008. We provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, we can make no assurance that the final outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which we make such determination. Legal, Product Liability Costs and Securities Claims We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We are also the subject of certain governmental investigations, which could result in substantial fines, penalties, and administrative remedies. We are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability and intellectual property infringement claims. We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims. We generally record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. In accordance with ASC Topic 450, Contingencies (formerly FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies), we accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages losses for general product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. We analyze litigation settlements to identify each element of the arrangement. We allocate arrangement consideration to patent licenses received based on estimates of fair value, and capitalize these amounts as assets if the license will provide an on-going future benefit. See Note L — Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for discussion of our individual material legal proceedings. 74 Table of Contents New Accounting Standards Standards Implemented In June 2009, the FASB issued Statement No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards CodificationÔ and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (codified within ASC Topic 105, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles), which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards CodificationÔ (ASC) as the single source of authoritative U.S. GAAP. The CodificationÔ supersedes all previous non-SEC accounting and reporting standards. We adopted Statement No. 168 for our third quarter ended September 30, 2009 and have conformed all references to accounting literature in this Annual Report to the appropriate reference within the CodificationÔ. All new authoritative guidance is issued in the form of ASC Updates. We have provided dual-referencing for those standards that we adopted prior to the issuance of the CodificationÔ. The adoption of this standard did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations. Statement No. 165 (codified within ASC Topic 855) In May 2009, the FASB issued Statement No. 165, Subsequent Events (codified within ASC Topic 855, Subsequent Events), which establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events occurring after the balance sheet date, but before the financial statements are issued or available to be issued. We adopted Statement No. 165 for our second quarter ended June 30, 2009. Its adoption did not impact our results of operations or financial condition. Refer to Note A — Significant Accounting Policies to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding our evaluation of subsequent events. Statement No. 161 (codified within ASC Topic 815) In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, (codified within ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging), which amends Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, by requiring expanded disclosures about an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities. Statement No. 161 requires increased qualitative, quantitative, and credit-risk disclosures, including (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement No. 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position and financial performance. We adopted Statement No. 161 as of our first quarter ended March 31, 2009. Refer to Note C — Fair Value Measurements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. Statement No. 141(R) (codified within ASC Topic 805) In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations (codified within ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations), a replacement for Statement No. 141. Statement No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements of Statement No. 141, but requires the recognition of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at their fair values as of the acquisition date. It also requires, for acquisitions involving contingent consideration, the recognition of a liability equal to the expected fair value of future contingent payments at the acquisition date. Additionally, Statement No. 141(R) supersedes FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date. Statement No. 141(R) now requires that purchased research and development acquired in a business combination be recognized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Further, Statement No. 141(R) requires that we recognize changes in acquired income tax uncertainties (applied to acquisitions 75 Table of Contents before and after the adoption date) as income tax expense or benefit. We were required to adopt all other provisions of Statement No. 141(R) prospectively for any acquisitions on or after January 1, 2009. We did not consummate any material business combinations during 2009. New Standards to be Implemented ASC Update No. 2009-13 In October 2009, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605): Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. The consensus in Update No. 2009-13 supersedes certain guidance in Topic 605 (formerly EITF Issue No. 00-21, Multiple-Element Arrangements). Update No. 2009-13 provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables. Update No. 2009-13 also expands the disclosure requirements for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. We are required to adopt Update No. 2009-13 as of January 1, 2011 and are in the process of determining the impact that the adoption of Update No. 2009-13 will have on our future results of operations or financial position. ASC Update No. 2009-17 In December 2009, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810) — Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities, which formally codifies FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). Update No. 2009-17 and Statement No. 167 amends Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, to require that an enterprise perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE). The analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both 1) the power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Update No. 2009-17 eliminated the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE and requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary. We are required to adopt Update No. 2009-17 for our first quarter ending March 31, 2010. We do not believe the adoption of Update No. 2009-17 will have a significant impact on our future results of operations or financial position. Additional Information Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans Periodically, certain of our executive officers adopt written stock trading plans in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and our own Stock Trading Policy. A Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan is a written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula(s) for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of our stock, including the exercise and sale of stock options, and is entered into at a time when the person is not in possession of material non-public information about the company. On August 18, 2009, William H. Kucheman, our Executive Vice President and President, Cardiology, Rhythm and Vascular Group entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan. Mr. Kucheman’s plan covers the sale of 17,668 shares of our stock to be acquired upon the exercise of 6,000 stock options expiring on July 25, 2010 and 11,668 stock options expiring on December 6, 2010. Transactions under Mr. Kucheman’s plan are based upon pre-established dates and stock price thresholds and will expire once all of the shares have been sold or August 31, 2010, whichever is earlier. On August 20, 2009, 11,668 stock options were exercised 76 Table of Contents and sold in accordance with the plan at the pre-established stock price threshold. On February 16, 2010, Kenneth J. Pucel, our Executive Vice President, Global Operations, entered into a Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plan. Mr. Pucel’s plan covers the sale of 5,000 shares of our stock to be acquired upon the exercise of 5,000 stock options expiring on July 25, 2010. Transactions under Mr. Pucel’s plan are based upon pre-established dates and stock price thresholds and will expire once all of the shares have been sold or July 26, 2010, whichever is earlier. Any transaction under Mr. Pucel’s plan will be disclosed publicly through appropriate filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. 77 Table of Contents Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control system to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2009, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ J. Raymond Elliott J. Raymond Elliott /s/ Sam R. Leno Sam R. Leno President and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President — Finance & Information Systems and Chief Financial Officer 78 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific Corporation We have audited Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2009 and 2008 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 25, 2010 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 25, 2010 79 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $4.742 billion as of December 31, 2009 and $4.396 billion as of December 31, 2008. We recorded $56 million of other assets and $110 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2009, as compared to $132 million of other assets and $195 million of other liabilities as of December 31, 2008. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $271 million as of December 31, 2009 and $315 million as of December 31, 2008. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $331 million as of December 31, 2009 and by $385 million as of December 31, 2008. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction. Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We have historically used interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We had no interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2009, as compared to the notional amount of $4.900 billion outstanding as of December 31, 2008. These interest rate derivative instruments fixed the interest rate on our expected LIBOR-indexed floating-rate loans. During 2009, these interest rate derivative instruments either matured as scheduled or were terminated in connection with the prepayment of our bank term loan. We recognized $27 million of interest expense related to early termination of these interest rate contracts during 2009. We recorded $46 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments as of December 31, 2008. A one-percentage point increase in interest rates would have increased the derivative instruments’ fair value by $32 million as of December 31, 2008. A one-percentage point decrease in interest rates would have decreased the derivative instruments’ fair value by $35 million as of December 31, 2008. As of December 31, 2009, $5.917 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates, representing nearly 100 percent of our total debt. See Note C — Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for detailed information regarding our derivative financial instruments. 80 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Boston Scientific Corporation at December 31, 2009 and 2008, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2009, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2009, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2010, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 25, 2010 81 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:42:15.593063
885725,BSX,BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORP,2011,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Executive Summary Financial Highlights and Trends In 2010, we generated net sales of $7.806 billion, as compared to $8.188 billion in 2009, a decrease of $382 million, or five percent. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed $62 million to our net sales in 2010, as compared to 2009. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, our net sales decreased $444 million, or five percent, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was attributable in part to the ship hold and removal of field inventory of all implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) systems and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) systems offered by our Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) division in the U.S., which we announced on March 15, 2010, after determining that certain instances of changes in the manufacturing process related to these products were not submitted for approval to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We have since submitted the required documentation and, on April 15, 2010, we received clearance from the FDA for certain of the manufacturing changes and immediately resumed distribution of our COGNIS® CRT-D systems and TELIGEN® ICD systems, which represent virtually all of our defibrillator implant volume in the U.S. We returned earlier generations of these products to the U.S. market on May 21, 2010, following required FDA clearance. We are working with our physician and patient customers to recapture market share lost as a result of the ship hold and have experienced better-than-expected recovery to date. However, our U.S. CRM net sales decreased $237 million in 2010, as compared to our market share exiting 2009, and we estimate that our U.S. defibrillator market share decreased approximately 300 basis points exiting 2010, as compared to the prior year, due primarily to these product actions. In addition, throughout 2010 we continued to experience competitive and other pricing pressures across our businesses and, particularly, on our drug-eluting coronary stent system offerings. Net sales of our drug-eluting coronary stent systems decreased $171 million in 2010, as compared to 2009, and we estimate that the average selling price of our drug-eluting stent systems in the U.S. decreased nine percent in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Further, our net sales have been adversely impacted by reductions in procedural volumes, due to unemployment levels and other economic factors. During 2010, net sales from our Endoscopy, Urology/Women’s Health, and Neuromodulation businesses increased $117 million, or eight percent, as compared to 2009, on the strength of new product introductions, increased sales investments and further expansion into international markets. Refer to the Business and Market Overview and Results of Operations sections for more discussion of our net sales by division and region. Our reported net loss in 2010 was $1.065 billion, or $0.70 per share, and was driven primarily by a goodwill impairment charge related to our U.S. CRM reporting unit following the ship hold and product removal actions described above. Our reported results for 2010 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and restructuring-related net charges; discrete tax items and amortization expense (after-tax) of $2.116 billion, or $1.39 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2010 was $1.051 billion, or $0.69 per share. Our reported net loss in 2009 was $1.025 billion, or $0.68 per share. Our reported results for 2009 included intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and restructuring-related net charges; discrete tax items and amortization expense of $2.207 billion (after-tax), or $1.46 per share. Excluding these items, net income for 2009 was $1.182 billion, or $0.78 per share. Net income and net income per share that exclude certain items are not measures prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). See Additional Information for an explanation of management’s use of these non-GAAP measures. The following is a reconciliation of our results of operations prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP to those adjusted results considered by management. Refer to Results of Operations for a discussion of each reconciling item: 38 Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2010 Tax Impact per in millions, except per share data Pre-Tax Impact After-Tax share GAAP results $ (1,063 ) $ (2 ) $ (1,065 ) $ (0.70 ) Non-GAAP adjustments: Goodwill impairment charge 1,817 1,817 1.20 * Intangible asset impairment charges 65 (10 ) 55 0.03 * Acquisition-related credits (245 ) 34 (211 ) (0.13 ) * Divestiture-related charges 2 2 0.00 * Restructuring-related charges 169 (48 ) 121 0.08 * Litigation-related net credits (104 ) 27 (77 ) (0.05 ) * Discrete tax items (11 ) (11 ) (0.01 ) * Amortization expense 513 (93 ) 420 0.27 * Adjusted results $ 1,154 $ (103 ) $ 1,051 $ 0.69 * Assumes dilution of 10.0 million shares for the year ended December 31, 2010 for all or a portion of these non-GAAP adjustments.

Cash generated by operating activities was $325 million in 2010 and $835 million in 2009, and included approximately $1.6 billion of litigation-related net payments in 2010, as compared to approximately $800 million in 2009, as well as the receipt of an acquisition-related milestone payment of $250 million. Our cash generated by operations continues to be a significant source of funds for servicing our outstanding debt obligations and investing in our growth. As of December 31, 2010, we had total debt of $5.438 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $213 million and working capital of $1.006 billion. During 2010, we completed the refinancing of the majority of our 2011 debt maturities, establishing a $1.0 billion term loan and syndicating a new $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, and prepaid in full our $900 million loan from Abbott and all $600 million of our senior notes due in June 2011. Further, in January 2011, we paid at maturity $250 million of our senior notes. In 2009, Standard & Poor’s upgraded our credit rating to investment grade with a stable outlook. In 2010, Fitch Ratings upgraded our outlook to positive from stable, and Moody’s raised our liquidity rating to its highest level. We believe these rating improvements reflect the strength of our product portfolio, our commitment to debt reduction, our improving financial fundamentals, and the progress we are making towards driving profitable sales growth. Recent Events As part of our strategy, we are realigning our business portfolio through select divestitures and targeted acquisitions in order to reduce risk, optimize operational leverage and accelerate profitable, sustainable revenue growth, while preserving our ability to meet the needs of physicians and their patients. We have recently announced several acquisitions targeting many of our priority growth areas, and, in January 2011, closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation. 39 Table of Contents Acquisitions We expect to continue to invest in our core franchises, and are also investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, priority growth areas including atrial fibrillation, autonomic modulation therapy, coronary artery disease, deep-brain stimulation, diabetes/obesity, endoluminal surgery, endoscopic pulmonary intervention, hypertension, peripheral vascular disease, structural heart disease, sudden cardiac arrest, and women’s health. In late 2010 and early 2011, we announced the acquisitions of Asthmatx, Inc.; Sadra Medical, Inc.; Atritech, Inc.; and Intelect Medical, Inc., targeting many of the above conditions and disease states. Each of these acquisitions is discussed in the Business and Market Overview section below. Business Divestiture In January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation for a purchase price of $1.5 billion in cash. We received $1.450 billion at closing, including an upfront payment of $1.426 billion, and $24 million which was placed into escrow to be released upon the completion of local closings in certain foreign jurisdictions, and will receive an additional $50 million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we expect will be completed over a period of approximately 24 months. We will provide transitional services through a transition services agreement, and will also supply products to Stryker. These transition services and supply agreements are expected to be effective for a period of up to 24 months following the closing of the transaction, subject to extension. Due to our continuing involvement in the operations of the Neurovascular business, the divestiture does not meet the criteria for presentation as a discontinued operation. Refer to Note C – Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. Business and Market Overview Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) Our CRM division develops, manufactures and markets a variety of implantable devices that monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities. Worldwide net sales of these products of $2.180 billion represented approximately 28 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2010. Our worldwide CRM net sales decreased $233 million, or ten percent, in 2010, as compared to 2009. Foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our CRM net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was driven primarily by the negative impact of the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our ICD and CRT-D systems earlier in the year. We experienced market share loss in the U.S. as a result of these actions; however, we believe that our products, including our COGNIS® CRT-D and TELIGEN® ICD systems, among the world’s smallest and thinnest high-energy devices, will continue to be successful in the global market. While we have recaptured a portion of our lost market share, the extent and timing of our recovery is difficult to predict. We estimate that our U.S. defibrillator market share exiting 2010 decreased approximately 300 basis points, as compared to our market share exiting 2009, due primarily to these product actions. Further, overall expectations of future CRM market growth have declined, driven primarily by competitive and other pricing pressures, as well as fewer launches of market-expanding technologies than previously anticipated. We estimate that the worldwide CRM market approximated $11.4 billion in 2010, representing a slight increase over the 2009 market size of $11.1 billion. In addition, physician reaction to study results published by the Journal of the American Medical Association regarding evidence-based guidelines for ICD implants and the U.S. Department of Justice investigation into ICD implants may have a negative impact on the CRM market. However, in September 2010, we received FDA approval for an exclusive expanded indication for use of our CRT-D systems with certain patients in earlier stages of heart failure. We believe this indication could potentially create an opportunity to expand the worldwide CRM market by approximately $250 million to $350 million over the next few years, and further enhance our position within that market. 40 Table of Contents The following are the components of our worldwide CRM net sales: Year Ended Year Ended (in millions) December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 U.S. International Total U.S. International Total Defibrillator systems $ 1,037 $ 562 $ 1,599 $ 1,248 $ 544 $ 1,792 Pacemaker systems 320 261 581 346 275 621 CRM products $ 1,357 $ 823 $ 2,180 $ 1,594 $ 819 $ 2,413 Our U.S. CRM net sales decreased $237 million, or 15 percent, in 2010 as compared to 2009, driven primarily by the ship hold and product removal actions involving our ICD and CRT-D systems, discussed above. We are committed to advancing our technologies to strengthen our CRM business. In 2010, we continued to execute on our product pipeline and expect to launch our next-generation line of defibrillators in the U.S. in late 2011 or early 2012, which include new features designed to improve functionality, diagnostic capability and ease of use. Due in part to anticipated changes to current FDA regulatory requirements industry-wide, which would increase the number of patients and length of time needed for certain clinical studies, we now expect to launch our next-generation INGENIO™ pacemaker system, which leverages the strength of our high-voltage platform and will be compatible with our LATITUDE® Patient Management System, in the U.S. in late 2011 or early 2012, depending on final FDA requirements. Refer to Regulatory Environment included in Item 1 of this Annual Report for more information. Our international CRM net sales increased $4 million, or less than one percent, in 2010, as compared to 2009. International net sales of our defibrillator systems increased $18 million, or three percent, in 2010, as compared to 2009, driven by strong market acceptance of our COGNIS® CRT-D and TELIGEN® ICD systems, and our recently-launched 4-SITE lead delivery system. In addition, in July 2009, we received CE Mark approval for our LATITUDE® Patient Management System and have since launched this technology in the majority of our European markets. The LATITUDE® technology, which is designed to enable physicians to monitor device performance remotely while patients are in their homes, is a key component of many of our CRM systems. In late 2010, we received CE Mark approval for our next-generation line of defibrillators, INCEPTA™, ENERGEN™ and PUNCTUA™, and plan to launch these products in our Europe/Middle East/Africa (EMEA) region and certain Inter-Continental countries in the first half of 2011. These products provide physicians and their patients with more options to customize therapy and enhance our market advantage in size, shape and longevity. We also plan to launch our next-generation INGENIO™ pacemaker system in these regions in the second half of 2011 and believe that these launches position us well within the worldwide CRM market. Net sales from our CRM products represent a significant source of our overall net sales. Therefore, increases or decreases in our CRM net sales could have a significant impact on our results of operations. The variables that may impact the size of the CRM market and/or our share of that market include, but are not limited to: • our ability to retain and attract key members of our CRM sales force and other key CRM personnel; • our ability to recapture lost market share following the ship hold and product removal of our ICD and CRT-D systems in the U.S.; • the impact of market and economic conditions on average selling prices and the overall number of procedures performed; • the ability of CRM manufacturers to maintain the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community, the referring physician community and prospective patients in CRM technologies; • future product field actions or new physician advisories by us or our competitors; • our ability to successfully develop and launch next-generation products and technology; 41 Table of Contents • clinical trials that may provide opportunities to expand indications for use, particularly in light of anticipated changes to current FDA regulatory requirements industry-wide; • variations in clinical results, reliability or product performance of our and our competitors’ products; • delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; and • new competitive launches. Coronary Stent Systems Our coronary stent system offerings include the VeriFLEX™ (Liberté®) bare-metal coronary stent system, designed to enhance deliverability and conformability, particularly in challenging lesions, as well as drug-eluting coronary stent systems. We are the only company in the industry to offer a two-drug platform strategy, which has enabled us to maintain our leadership position in the drug-eluting stent market. We currently market our TAXUS® paclitaxel-eluting stent line, including our third-generation TAXUS® Element™ stent system, launched in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries during the second quarter of 2010. The CE Mark approval for our TAXUS® Element™ stent system includes a specific indication for treatment in diabetic patients. We also offer our everolimus-eluting stent line, consisting of the PROMUS® stent system, currently supplied to us by Abbott Laboratories, and our next-generation internally-developed and manufactured everolimus-eluting stent system, the PROMUS® Element™ stent system, which we launched in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries in the fourth quarter of 2009. In September 2010, we received CE Mark approval for expanded indications for the use of our PROMUS® Element™ stent system in diabetic and heart attack patients. Our Element™ stent platform incorporates a unique platinum chromium alloy designed to offer greater radial strength and flexibility than older alloys, enhanced visibility and reduced recoil. The innovative stent design improves deliverability and allows for more consistent lesion coverage and drug distribution. These product offerings demonstrate our commitment to drug-eluting stent market leadership and continued innovation. We expect to launch our TAXUS® Element™ stent system in the U.S. (to be commercialized as ION™) in mid-2011 and Japan in late 2011 or early 2012. We expect to launch our PROMUS® Element™ stent system in the U.S. and Japan in mid-2012. Net sales of our coronary stent systems, including bare-metal stent systems, of $1.670 billion represented approximately 21 percent of our consolidated net sales in 2010. Worldwide sales of these products decreased $209 million, or 11 percent, in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which contributed $26 million to our coronary stent system net sales in 2010, as compared to 2009, net sales of these products decreased 12 percent, as compared to the prior year. Despite continued competition and pricing pressures resulting in a decline in sales of these products, we maintained our leadership position in 2010 with an estimated 36 percent share of the worldwide drug-eluting stent market, as compared to 41 percent in 2009. We estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market approximated $5.0 billion in 2010, consistent with the 2009 market size. The size of the coronary stent market is driven primarily by the number of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures performed, as well as the percentage of those in which stents are implanted; the number of devices used per procedure; average selling prices; and the drug-eluting stent penetration rate2. 2 A measure of the mix between bare-metal and drug-eluting stents used across procedures. 42 Table of Contents The following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales: Year Ended Year Ended (in millions) December 31, 2010 December 31, 2009 U.S. International Total U.S. International Total TAXUS® $ 277 $ 223 $ 500 $ 431 $ 596 $ 1,027 PROMUS® 528 282 810 480 201 681 PROMUS® Element™ 227 227 Drug-eluting stent systems 805 732 1,537 911 797 1,708 Bare-metal stent systems 44 89 133 57 114 171 $ 849 $ 821 $ 1,670 $ 968 $ 911 $ 1,879 Our U.S. net sales of drug-eluting stent systems decreased $106 million, or 12 percent, in 2010, as compared to 2009. This decrease resulted primarily from a decline in our share of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market, as well as an overall decrease in the size of this market, resulting principally from lower average selling prices driven by competitive and other pricing pressures. We estimate our share of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market approximated 46 percent for the last five quarters, as compared to an average of 49 percent during 2009, and estimate that the average selling price of drug-eluting stent systems in the U.S. decreased approximately nine percent in 2010, as compared to 2009. This decline was due primarily to lower sales of our TAXUS® drug-eluting stent systems, which we believe was due to customer perceptions of data from a single-center, non-double-blinded, underpowered study sponsored by one of our competitors. We believe that average drug-eluting stent penetration rates in the U.S. were 77 percent in 2010, as compared to an average of 75 percent during 2009, which partially offset the impact of lower average selling prices on the size of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market. We believe we have maintained our leadership position in this market due to the success of our two-drug platform strategy and the breadth of our product offerings, including the industry’s widest range of coronary stent sizes. Our international drug-eluting stent system net sales decreased $65 million, or eight percent, in 2010, as compared to 2009. Net sales of our drug-eluting stent systems in Japan decreased $49 million, or 19 percent, in 2010, as compared to the prior year and our estimated share of the drug-eluting stent market in Japan declined to an average of 39 percent in 2010 (exiting at 36 percent), as compared to an average of 49 percent in 2009 (exiting at 44 percent). We believe that aggressive pricing offered by market entrants and clinical trial enrollment limiting our access to certain customers contributed to the decline in our market share in Japan in 2010, as compared to the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by our first quarter 2010 launch of the PROMUS® stent system in Japan, enabling us to begin the execution of our two-drug platform strategy in this region. Our net sales of drug-eluting stent systems in our EMEA region decreased $26 million, or eight percent in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to declines in average selling prices, partially offset by increased penetration rates. However, in the second quarter of 2010, we launched our third-generation TAXUS® Element™ stent system in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries. We believe that this launch, coupled with the November 2009 launch of our PROMUS® Element™ stent system, which has quickly gained market share, exiting 2010 with approximately one quarter share of the drug-eluting stent market in EMEA, position us well in this market going forward. Net sales of drug-eluting stent systems in our Inter-Continental region increased $10 million, or five percent, driven by an increase in penetration rates and procedural volume. We market the PROMUS® everolimus-eluting coronary stent system, a private-labeled XIENCE V® stent system supplied to us by Abbott Laboratories. As of the closing of Abbott’s 2006 acquisition of Guidant Corporation’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, we obtained a perpetual license to the intellectual property used in Guidant’s drug-eluting stent system program purchased by Abbott. We believe that being the only company to offer two distinct drug-eluting stent platforms provides us a considerable advantage in the drug-eluting stent market and has enabled us to sustain our worldwide leadership position. However, under the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit and operating profit margin of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott, including any improvements or iterations approved for sale during the term of the applicable supply arrangements and of the type that could be approved by a supplement to an approved FDA pre-market approval, is significantly lower than that of our TAXUS® and PROMUS® Element™ stent systems. Specifically, the PROMUS® stent system has operating profit margins that approximate half of our TAXUS® stent system operating profit margin. Therefore, if sales of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to 43 Table of Contents us by Abbott increase in relation to our total drug-eluting stent system sales, our profit margins will decrease. Refer to our Gross Profit discussion for more information on the impact this sales mix has had on our gross profit margins. Our internally-developed and manufactured PROMUS® Element™ everolimus-eluting stent system, launched in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries in the fourth quarter of 2009, generates gross profit margins more favorable than the PROMUS® stent system and we expect will positively affect our overall gross profit and operating profit margins in these regions as sales shift from PROMUS® to PROMUS® Element™. Further, the price we pay for our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems from Abbott is determined by contracts with Abbott and is based, in part, on previously fixed estimates of Abbott’s manufacturing costs for everolimus-eluting stent systems and third-party reports of our average selling price of these stent systems. Amounts paid pursuant to this pricing arrangement are subject to a retroactive adjustment approximately every two years based on Abbott’s actual costs to manufacture these stent systems for us and our average selling price of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott. Our gross profit margin may be positively or negatively impacted in the future as a result of this adjustment process. We are currently reliant on Abbott for our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems in the U.S. and Japan. Our supply agreement with Abbott for everolimus-eluting stent systems in the U.S. and Japan extends through the end of the second quarter of 2012. At present, we believe that our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems from Abbott, coupled with our current launch plans for our internally-developed and manufactured PROMUS® Element™ everolimus-eluting stent system, is sufficient to meet customer demand. However, any production or capacity issues that affect Abbott’s manufacturing capabilities or our process for forecasting, ordering and receiving shipments may impact the ability to increase or decrease our level of supply in a timely manner; therefore, our supply of everolimus-eluting stent systems supplied to us by Abbott may not align with customer demand, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. Further, a delay in the launch of our internally-developed and manufactured PROMUS® Element™ everolimus-eluting stent system in the U.S. and Japan, currently expected in mid-2012, could result in an inability to meet customer demand for everolimus-eluting stent systems. Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial end points. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, our competitors or third parties, or the market’s perception of these clinical data, may adversely impact our position in, and share of, the drug-eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market. We believe that we can sustain our leadership position within the worldwide drug-eluting stent market in the foreseeable future for a variety of reasons, including: • our two-drug platform strategy, including specialty stent sizes; • the broad and consistent long-term results of our TAXUS® clinical trials, and the favorable results of the XIENCE V®/PROMUS® and PROMUS® Element™ stent system clinical trials to date; • the performance benefits of our current and future technology; • the strength of our pipeline of drug-eluting stent products, including our PROMUS® Element™ and TAXUS® Element™ stent systems, in additional geographies; • our overall position in the worldwide interventional medicine market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force; and • the strength of our clinical, selling, marketing and manufacturing capabilities. 44 Table of Contents However, a decline in net sales from our drug-eluting stent systems could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and operating cash flows. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug-eluting stent market and our position within this market include, but are not limited to: • the impact of competitive pricing pressure on average selling prices of drug-eluting stent systems available in the market; • the impact and outcomes of on-going and future clinical results involving our or our competitors’ products, including those trials sponsored by our competitors, or perceived product performance of our or our competitors’ products; • physician and patient confidence in our current and next-generation technology; • our ability to successfully launch next-generation products and technology features, including the PROMUS® Element™ and TAXUS® Element™ stent systems in additional geographies; • changes in drug-eluting stent penetration rates, the overall number of PCI procedures performed and the average number of stents used per procedure; • delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; • new competitive product launches; and • the outcome of intellectual property litigation. During 2009 and early 2010, we successfully negotiated closure of several long-standing legal matters, including multiple matters with Johnson & Johnson; all outstanding litigation between us and Medtronic, Inc. with respect to interventional cardiology and endovascular repair cases; and all outstanding litigation between us and Bruce Saffran, M.D., Ph.D. However, there continues to be significant intellectual property litigation particularly in the coronary stent market. In particular, although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with Johnson & Johnson, we continue to be involved in patent litigation with them, particularly relating to drug-eluting stent systems. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) In addition to coronary stent systems, our Interventional Cardiology business markets balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures, as well as ultrasound imaging systems. Our worldwide net sales of these products decreased to $932 million in 2010, as compared to $980 million in 2009, a decrease of $48 million, or five percent. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations which contributed $12 million to our Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year, net sales of these products decreased $60 million, or six percent. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $394 million in 2010, as compared to $409 million in 2009. Our international net sales of these products were $538 million in 2010, as compared to $571 million for the prior year. This decrease was the result of a delay in new product introductions, pricing pressures and competitive product launches. We continue to hold a strong leadership position in the PTCA balloon catheter market, maintaining an estimated 56 percent average share of the U.S. market and 38 percent worldwide in 2010. We have executed and are planning a number of additional new product launches during 2011, including the full launch of our Apex™ pre-dilatation balloon catheter with platinum marker bands for improved radiopacity, launched in limited markets during the second quarter of 2010. In June 2010, we launched the NC Quantum Apex™ post-dilatation balloon catheter, developed specifically to address physicians’ needs in optimizing coronary stent deployment, which has been received positively in the market. In addition, we began a phased launch of our Kinetix™ family of guidewires in the U.S., our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries in April 2010. 45 Table of Contents As part of our strategic plan, we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, other areas and disease states, including structural heart. In January 2011, we completed the acquisition of Sadra Medical, Inc. Sadra is developing a repositionable and retrievable device for percutaneous aortic valve replacement (PAVR) to treat patients with severe aortic stenosis and recently completed a series of European feasibility studies for its Lotus™ Valve System, which consists of a stent-mounted tissue valve prosthesis and catheter delivery system for guidance and placement of the valve. The low-profile delivery system and introducer sheath are designed to enable accurate positioning, repositioning and retrieval at any time prior to release of the aortic valve implant. PAVR is one of the fastest growing medical device markets. Peripheral Interventions Our Peripheral Interventions business product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, sheaths, wires and vena cava filters, which are used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease, and we continue to hold the number one position in the worldwide Peripheral Interventions market. Our worldwide net sales of these products increased to $669 million in 2010, as compared to $661 million in 2009, an increase of $8 million, or one percent. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which contributed $6 million to our Peripheral Interventions net sales in 2010, as compared the prior year, net sales of these products increased $2 million, or less than one percent, as compared to 2009. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $310 million in 2010, as compared to $320 million for the prior year. Our international net sales were $359 million in 2010, as compared to $341 million in 2009, driven by several international product launches, including the second quarter 2010 launch in Japan of our Carotid WALLSTENT® Monorail® Endoprosthesis. We look forward to new product launches, including our next-generation percutaneous transluminal angioplasty balloon, expected in the second half of 2011 and believe that these launches, coupled with the strength of our Express® SD Renal Monorail® premounted stent system; our Express LD Stent System, which received FDA approval in the first quarter of 2010 for an iliac indication; our Sterling® Monorail® and Over-the-Wire balloon dilatation catheter and our extensive line of Interventional Oncology product solutions, will continue to position us well in the growing Peripheral Interventions market. Electrophysiology We develop less-invasive medical technologies used in the diagnosis and treatment of rate and rhythm disorders of the heart. Our leading products include the Blazer™ line of ablation catheters, including our next-generation Blazer™ Prime ablation catheter, designed to deliver enhanced performance, responsiveness and durability, which we launched in the U.S. in the fourth quarter of 2009. Worldwide net sales of our Electrophysiology products decreased to $147 million in 2010, as compared to $149 million in 2009, a decrease of $2 million, or two percent, due principally to product availability constraints with our Chilli II™ catheter line. Foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our Electrophysiology net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $112 million, as compared to $116 million for the prior year, and our international net sales were $35 million in 2010, as compared to $33 million in 2009. We have begun a limited launch of our Blazer™ Prime ablation catheter in the U.S., our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries, and believe that with the increasing adoption of this technology and other upcoming product launches, we are well-positioned within the Electrophysiology market. As part of our strategic plan, we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, other areas and disease states, including atrial fibrillation. In January 2011, we announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which we will acquire Atritech, Inc., subject to customary closing conditions. Atritech has developed a novel device designed to close the left atrial appendage in patients with atrial fibrillation who are at risk for ischemic stroke. The WATCHMAN® Left Atrial Appendage Closure Technology, developed by Atritech, is the first device proven in a randomized clinical trial to offer an alternative to anticoagulant drugs, and is approved for use in CE Mark countries. Endoscopy Our Endoscopy division develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems. Our worldwide net sales of these products increased to $1.079 billion in 2010, as compared to $1.006 billion in 2009, an increase of $73 million, or seven percent. 46 Table of Contents Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which contributed $9 million to our Endoscopy net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year, net sales of these products increased $64 million, or six percent, as compared to 2009. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $541 million in 2010, as compared to $517 million for the prior year, and our international net sales were $538 million in 2010, as compared to $489 million in 2009. These increases were due primarily to higher net sales within our stent franchise, driven by the continued commercialization and adoption of our WallFlex® family of stents, in particular, the WallFlex Biliary line and WallFlex Esophageal line. In addition, our hemostasis franchise net sales benefited from increased utilization of our Resolution® Clip Device, an endoscopic mechanical clip to treat gastrointestinal bleeding, and our biliary franchise drove solid growth on the strength of our rapid exchange biliary devices. During 2010, we introduced expanded sizes of our Radial® Jaw 4 biopsy forceps, and have launched a number of new products targeting the biliary interventional market. As part of our strategic plan, we are investigating opportunities to further expand our presence in, and diversify into, other areas and disease states, including endoscopic pulmonary intervention. On October 26, 2010, we completed our acquisition of Asthmatx, Inc. Asthmatx designs, manufactures and markets a less-invasive, catheter-based bronchial thermoplasty procedure for the treatment of severe persistent asthma. The Alair® Bronchial Thermoplasty System, developed by Asthmatx, has both CE Mark and FDA approval and is the first device-based asthma treatment approved by the FDA. We expect this technology to strengthen our existing offering of pulmonary devices and contribute to the mid- to long-term growth and diversification of the Endoscopy business. Urology/Women’s Health Our Urology/Women’s Health division develops and manufactures devices to treat various urological and gynecological disorders. Our worldwide net sales of these products increased to $481 million in 2010 from $456 million in 2009, an increase of $25 million, or five percent. Foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our Urology/Women’s Health net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $365 million in 2010, as compared to $353 million in 2009, and our international net sales were $116 million in 2010, as compared to $103 million for the prior year. These increases were driven by new product introductions and increased sales investments. In 2011, we plan to expand the launch of our recently-approved Genesys Hydro ThermAblator® (HTA) system, a next-generation endometrial ablation system designed to ablate the endometrial lining of the uterus in premenopausal women with menorrhagia. The Genesys HTA System features a smaller and lighter console, simplified set-up requirements, and an enhanced graphic user interface and is designed to improve operating performance. We believe this new product offering will enable us to increase our share of this market. Neuromodulation Within our Neuromodulation business, we market the Precision® Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) system, used for the management of chronic pain. Our worldwide net sales of Neuromodulation products increased to $304 million in 2010, as compared to $285 million in 2009, an increase of $19 million, or seven percent. Foreign currency fluctuations did not materially impact our Neuromodulation net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $288 million in 2010 as compared to $271 million for the prior year, and our international net sales of these products were $16 million in 2010, as compared to $14 million in 2009, driven by an increase in procedural volume and new product launches. In 2010, we received FDA approval and launched two lead splitters, as well as the Linear™ 3-4 and Linear 3-6 Percutaneous Leads for use with our SCS systems, offering a broader range of lead configurations and designed to provide physicians more treatment options for their chronic pain patients. These represent the broadest range of percutaneous lead configurations in the industry. We believe that we continue to have a technology advantage over our competitors with proprietary features such as Multiple Independent Current Control, which is intended to allow the physician to target specific areas of pain more precisely, and are involved in various studies designed to evaluate the use of spinal cord stimulation in the treatment of additional sources of pain. As a demonstration of our commitment to strengthening clinical evidence with spinal cord stimulation, we have initiated a trial to assess the therapeutic effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of spinal cord stimulation compared to reoperation in patients with failed back surgery syndrome. We believe that this trial could result in consideration of spinal cord stimulation much earlier in the continuum of care. In addition, in late 2010 we initiated a European clinical trial for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease using our Vercise™ deep-brain stimulation system, and, in January 2011, we completed the 47 Table of Contents acquisition of Intelect Medical, Inc., a development-stage company developing advanced visualization and programming for the Vercise™ system. We believe this acquisition leverages the core architecture of our Vercise™ platform and advances the field of deep-brain stimulation. Neurovascular In January 2011, we closed the sale our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation. We will provide transitional services through a transition services agreement, and will also supply products to Stryker. These transition services and supply agreements are expected to be effective for a period of up to 24 months following the closing of the transaction, subject to extension, and we will recognize net sales on the sale of Neurovascular products in certain countries during this period. Our future sales of Neurovascular products to Stryker will be significantly lower than our 2010 Neurovascular net sales and will be at significantly reduced gross margins. The Neurovascular business markets a broad line of coated and uncoated detachable coils, micro-delivery stents, micro-guidewires, micro-catheters, guiding catheters and embolics to neuro-interventional radiologists and neurosurgeons to treat diseases of the neurovascular system. Our worldwide net sales of Neurovascular products decreased to $340 million in 2010, as compared to $348 million in 2009, a decrease of $8 million, or two percent. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, which contributed $7 million to Neurovascular net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year, net sales of these products decreased $15 million, or four percent, in 2010, as compared to 2009. Our U.S. net sales of these products were $120 million, as compared to $125 million for the prior year, and our international net sales were $220 million in 2010, as compared to $223 million in 2009. These decreases resulted primarily from new competitive launches and a delay in the launch of the next-generation family of detachable coils, as well the impact of a field action initiated during the third quarter with respect to selective lots of the Matrix® Detachable Coil. However, in October 2010, we received FDA approval for the next-generation family of detachable coils, which includes an enhanced delivery system designed to reduce coil detachment times and began a phased launch of the product in 2010. In 2010, we also launched the Neuroform EZ™ stent system, the fourth-generation intracranial aneurysm stent system designed for use in conjunction with endovascular coiling to treat wide-necked aneurysms, in the U.S. and our EMEA region. FDA Matters In January 2006, we received a corporate warning letter from the FDA notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our facilities and advising us that our corporate-wide corrective action plan relating to three site-specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. We identified solutions to the quality system issues cited by the FDA and implemented those solutions throughout our organization. During 2008, the FDA reinspected a number of our facilities and, in October 2008, informed us that our quality system was in substantial compliance with its Quality System Regulations. In November 2009 and January 2010, the FDA reinspected two of our sites to follow-up on observations from the 2008 FDA inspections. Both of these FDA inspections confirmed that all issues at the sites have been resolved and all restrictions related to the corporate warning letter were removed. On August 11, 2010, we were notified by the FDA that the corporate warning letter had been lifted. In August 2010, the FDA released numerous draft proposals on the 510(k) process aimed at increasing transparency and streamlining the process, while adding more scientific rigor to the review process. In January 2011, the FDA released the implementation plan for changes to the 510(k) Submission program, which includes additional training of FDA staff, the creation of various guidance documents intended to provide greater clarity to certain processes, as well as various internal changes to the FDA’s procedures. We have a portfolio of products that includes numerous Class II medical devices. Several of the FDA’s proposals could increase the regulatory burden on our industry, including those that could increase the cost, complexity and time to market for certain high-risk Class II medical devices. Restructuring Initiatives We are a diversified worldwide medical device leader and hold number one or two positions in the majority of the markets in which we compete. Since our inception, we have generated significant revenue growth driven by product innovation, strategic acquisitions and robust investments in research and development. We generate 48 Table of Contents strong cash flow, which has enabled us to reduce our debt obligations and further invest in our growth. On an on-going basis, we monitor the dynamics of the economy, the healthcare industry, and the markets in which we compete; and we continue to assess opportunities for improved operational effectiveness and efficiency, and better alignment of expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make the investments in research and development projects, capital and our people that are essential to our long-term success. As a result of these assessments, we have undertaken various restructuring initiatives in order to enhance our growth potential and position us for long-term success. These initiatives are described below, and additional information can be found in Results of Operations and Note I – Restructuring-related Activities to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. 2010 Restructuring plan On February 6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to focus our business, drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the integration of our Cardiovascular and CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions; the centralization of our research and development organization; the re-alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets; and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio. We estimate that the execution of this plan will result in gross reductions in pre-tax operating expenses of approximately $200 million to $250 million, once completed in 2012. We expect to reinvest a portion of the savings into customer-facing and other activities to help drive future sales growth and support the business. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012. We expect the execution of the 2010 Restructuring plan will result in the elimination of approximately 1,000 to 1,300 positions worldwide. Plant Network Optimization In January 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a Plant Network Optimization program, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The program is a complement to our 2007 Restructuring plan, discussed below, and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins. We estimate that the program will result in annualized run-rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65 million exiting 2012. These savings are in addition to the estimated $35 million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs from activities under our 2007 Restructuring plan, discussed below. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012. 2007 Restructuring plan In October 2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count reduction plan (the 2007 Restructuring plan). The plan was intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short- and long-term shareholder value. Key activities under the plan included the restructuring of several businesses, corporate functions and product franchises in order to better utilize resources, strengthen competitive positions, and create a more simplified and efficient business model; the elimination, suspension or reduction of spending on certain research and development projects; and the transfer of certain production lines among facilities. The execution of this plan enabled us to reduce research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately $500 million exiting 2008. We have partially reinvested our savings from these initiatives into targeted head count increases, primarily in customer-facing positions. In addition, we expect reductions of annualized run-rate manufacturing costs of approximately $35 million exiting 2010 as a result of transfers of certain production lines. Due to the longer term nature of these initiatives, we do not expect to achieve the full benefit of these reductions in manufacturing costs until 2012. We initiated activities under the plan in the fourth quarter of 2007. The transfer of certain production lines contemplated under the 2007 Restructuring plan was completed as of December 31, 2010; all other major 49 Table of Contents activities under the plan, with the exception of final production line transfers, were completed as of December 31, 2009. Healthcare Reform The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act were enacted into law in the U.S. in 2010. Certain provisions of the legislation will not be effective for a number of years and there are many programs and requirements for which the details have not yet been fully established or consequences not fully understood, and it is unclear what the full impact will be from the legislation. The legislation imposes on medical device manufacturers a 2.3 percent excise tax on U.S. sales of Class I, II and III medical devices beginning in 2013. U.S. net sales represented 56 percent of our worldwide net sales in 2010 and, therefore, this tax burden may have a material negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Other provisions of this legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at improving quality and decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board, and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed and delivered, and may adversely affect our business and results of operations. Further, we cannot predict what healthcare programs and regulations will be ultimately implemented at the federal or state level, or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the U.S. or internationally. However, any changes that lower reimbursements for our products or reduce medical procedure volumes could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Results of Operations Net Sales We manage our international operating segments on a constant currency basis, and we manage market risk from currency exchange rate changes at the corporate level. Management excludes the impact of foreign exchange for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. To calculate revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of currency exchange, we convert current period and prior period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using current period currency exchange rates. The regional constant currency growth rates in the tables below can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note P – Segment Reporting to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As of December 31, 2010, we had four reportable segments based on geographic regions: the United States; EMEA, consisting of Europe, the Middle East and Africa; Japan; and Inter-Continental, consisting of our Asia Pacific and the Americas operating segments. The reportable segments represent an aggregate of all operating divisions within each segment. The following tables provide our worldwide net sales by region and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis: 2010 versus 2009 2009 versus 2008 As Reported Constant As Reported Constant Year Ended December 31, Currency Currency Currency Currency (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Basis Basis Basis Basis United States $ 4,335 $ 4,675 $ 4,487 (7) % (7) % 4 % 4 % EMEA 1,759 1,837 1,960 (4) % (1) % (6) % 1 % Japan 968 988 861 (2) % (8) % 15 % 4 % Inter-Continental 740 677 673 9 % 1 % 1 % 8 % International 3,467 3,502 3,494 (1) % (3) % 0 % 3 % Subtotal 7,802 8,177 7,981 (5) % (5) % 2 % 4 % Divested Businesses 4 11 69 N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide $ 7,806 $ 8,188 $ 8,050 (5) % (5) % 2 % 3 % The following table provides our worldwide net sales by division and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis. 50 Table of Contents 2010 versus 2009 2009 versus 2008 As Reported Constant As Reported Constant Year Ended December 31, Currency Currency Currency Currency (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Basis Basis Basis Basis Cardiac Rhythm Management $ 2,180 $ 2,413 $ 2,286 (10) % (10) % 6 % 7 % Interventional Cardiology 2,602 2,859 2,879 (9) % (10) % (1) % 0 % Peripheral Interventions 669 661 684 1 % 0 % (3) % (2) % Cardiovascular Group 3,271 3,520 3,563 (7) % (8) % (1) % 0 % Electrophysiology 147 149 153 (2) % (2) % (2) % (1) % Neurovascular 340 348 360 (2) % (4) % (3) % (2) % Endoscopy 1,079 1,006 943 7 % 6 % 7 % 8 % Urology/Women’s Health 481 456 431 5 % 5 % 6 % 6 % Neuromodulation 304 285 245 7 % 7 % 17 % 17 % Subtotal 7,802 8,177 7,981 (5) % (5) % 2 % 4 % Divested Businesses 4 11 69 N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide $ 7,806 $ 8,188 $ 8,050 (5) % (5) % 2 % 3 % The divisional constant currency growth rates in the tables above can be recalculated from the reconciliations provided below.

The decrease was driven primarily by lower U.S. CRM net sales of $237 million, due primarily to the ship hold and product removal actions impacting our ICD and CRT-D systems discussed above, as well as a decline in U.S. coronary stent system net sales of $119 million, due primarily to a decline in our share of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market as well as lower average selling prices. In addition, U.S. net sales of our Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) business decreased $15 million in 2010, as compared to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by increases of U.S. net sales in 2010 from our Endoscopy business of $24 million, $12 million attributable to our Urology/Women’s Health business, and $17 million of growth in our Neuromodulation 51 Table of Contents business, as compared to 2009. Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our net sales. During 2009, our U.S. net sales increased $188 million, or four percent, as compared to 2008. The increase was driven primarily by an increase in U.S. CRM net sales of $125 million and an increase of $47 million in U.S. net sales of our coronary stent systems. In addition, U.S. net sales in 2009 from our Endoscopy business grew $40 million, our Urology/Women’s Health net sales increased $18 million, and our Neuromodulation division increased U.S. net sales $37 million in 2009, as compared to 2008. These increases were partially offset by declines in U.S. net sales from our Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) business of $52 million and a decrease of $16 million in Peripheral Interventions U.S. net sales in 2009, as compared to the prior year. International Net Sales During 2010, our international net sales decreased $35 million, or one percent, as compared to 2009. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed $62 million to our international net sales in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, net sales in our EMEA region decreased $21 million, or one percent, in 2010, as compared the prior year. Our net sales in Japan decreased $81 million, or eight percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to competitive launches of drug-eluting stent system technology and clinical trial enrollment limiting our access to certain drug-eluting stent system customers, as well as reductions in average selling prices. Net sales in our Inter-Continental region, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, increased $5 million, or one percent, in 2010, as compared to the prior year. Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for further discussion of our net sales. During 2009, our international net sales increased $8 million, or less than one percent, as compared to 2008. Foreign currency fluctuations contributed a negative $92 million to our international net sales, as compared to the prior year. Excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, net sales in our EMEA region increased $11 million, or one percent, in 2009, as compared to 2008. Our net sales in Japan increased $37 million, or four percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to an increase in coronary stent system sales following the launch of our second-generation TAXUS® Liberté® stent system in that region. Net sales in our Inter-Continental region increased $52 million, or eight percent, excluding the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, in 2009, as compared to the prior year. Gross Profit Our gross profit was $5.207 billion in 2010, $5.612 billion in 2009, and $5.581 billion in 2008. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit decreased to 66.7 percent in 2010, as compared to 68.5 percent in 2009 and 69.3 percent in 2008. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit margins and a description of the drivers of the change from period to period: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Gross profit - prior year 68.5 % 69.3 % Drug-eluting stent system sales mix and pricing (1.7) % (1.4) % Impact of CRM ship hold (0.4) % Net impact of foreign currency 0.1 % 0.9 % All other 0.2 % (0.3) % Gross profit - current year 66.7 % 68.5 % The primary factor contributing to the reduction in our gross profit margin during 2010 and 2009, as compared to the prior years, was, in each year, a further decrease in sales of our higher-margin TAXUS® drug-eluting stent systems and an increasing shift towards the PROMUS® stent system, as well as declines in the average selling prices of drug-eluting stent systems. Sales of the PROMUS® stent system represented approximately 52 percent of our worldwide drug-eluting stent system sales in 2010, 40 percent in 2009, and 19 percent in 2008. As a result of the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit margin of a PROMUS® stent system, supplied to us by Abbott, is significantly lower than that of our TAXUS® stent system. In the fourth quarter of 2009, we launched our next-generation internally-developed and manufactured PROMUS® Element™ everolimus-eluting 52 Table of Contents stent system in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries. This product generates gross profit margins more favorable than the PROMUS® stent system, and has positively affected our overall gross profit and operating profit margins. We expect to launch our PROMUS® Element™ stent system in the U.S. and Japan in mid-2012. In addition, the average selling prices of drug-eluting stent systems have decreased, including an estimated nine percent decline in the U.S., in 2010, as compared to 2009. Our gross profit margin in 2010 was also negatively impacted by the ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. CRM business previously discussed. We expect our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, will continue to be negatively impacted by declines in average selling prices across our businesses. In addition, our 2011 gross profit percentage will be negatively impacted as a result of our expected low-margin sales of Neurovascular product to Stryker under the terms of our transitional supply agreements. Operating Expenses The following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 % of Net % of Net % of Net (in millions) $ Sales $ Sales $ Sales Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,580 33.1 2,635 32.2 2,589 32.2 Research and development expenses 939 12.0 1,035 12.6 1,006 12.5 Royalty expense 185 2.4 191 2.3 203 2.5 Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses In 2010, our SG&A expenses decreased $55 million, or two percent, as compared to 2009. This decrease was related primarily to savings from our restructuring initiatives driven by lower head count and lower consulting and travel spending, as compared to the prior year. These decreases were partially offset by an $11 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations. As a percentage of net sales, our SG&A expenses were slightly higher than 2009 due to the impact of maintaining compensation levels for our U.S. CRM sales force, despite the reduction in our net sales of our CRM products in the U.S. We plan to increase our investment in SG&A in 2011 to introduce new products; strengthen our sales organization in emerging markets such as Brazil, China and India; and to support our acquired businesses; as a result, our SG&A expenses are likely to increase slightly as a percentage of net sales in 2011, as compared to 2010. In 2009, our SG&A expenses increased by $46 million, or two percent, as compared to 2008. This increase was related primarily to the addition of direct selling expenses and head count, including expanding our global sales force and an increase in costs associated with various litigation-related matters. These increases were partially offset by a benefit from foreign currency fluctuations of approximately $22 million. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses In 2010, our R&D expenses decreased $96 million, or nine percent, as compared to 2009. This decrease was due to the on-going re-prioritization of R&D projects and the re-allocation of spending as part of our efforts to focus on products with higher returns, as well as the delay of certain of our clinical trials. We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects across our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth. In 2009, our R&D expenses increased $29 million, or three percent, as compared to 2008. As a percentage of net sales, our R&D expenses in 2009 were relatively flat with the prior year. Royalty Expense 53 Table of Contents In 2010, our royalty expense decreased $6 million, or three percent, as compared to 2009. This decrease was due primarily to lower sales of our drug-eluting coronary stent systems, partially offset by the continued shift in the mix of our drug-eluting stent system sales towards the PROMUS® and PROMUS® Element™ stent systems. The royalty rate applied to sales of these stent systems is, on average, higher than that associated with sales of our TAXUS® stent systems. In 2009, our royalty expense decreased $12 million, or six percent, as compared to 2008. The decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in royalty expense of $29 million attributable to the expiration of a CRM royalty agreement during the first quarter of 2009. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in royalty expense of $20 million as a result of an increase in sales of our drug-eluting stent systems, as well as the shift in the mix of our drug-eluting stent system sales towards the PROMUS® stent system, following its launch in the U.S. in mid-2008. Loss on Program Termination In the second quarter of 2009, we discontinued one of our internal R&D programs in order to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $16 million, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations (formerly FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities), associated with future payments that we believe we remain contractually obligated to make. We continue to focus on developing new technologies that we believe will contribute to profitable sales growth in the future and do not believe that the cancellation of this program will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or cash flows. Amortization Expense Amortization expense was $513 million in 2010, as compared to $511 million in 2009, an increase of $2 million, or less than one percent. This non-cash charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. Amortization expense was $511 million in 2009, as compared to $543 million in 2008, a decrease of $32 million, or six percent. This decrease was due primarily to the impact of certain Interventional Cardiology-related intangible assets reaching the end of their accounting useful life during 2008, as well as the write-down of certain intangible assets to their fair values in 2009 and 2008, described in Other Intangible Asset Impairment Charges below. Goodwill Impairment Charges We test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. The ship hold and product removal actions associated with our U.S. ICD and CRT-D products, which we announced on March 15, 2010, and the expected corresponding financial impact on our operations created an indication of potential impairment of the goodwill balance attributable to our U.S. CRM reporting unit. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test in accordance with our accounting policies and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $1.817 billion, on both a pre-tax and after-tax basis, associated with our U.S. CRM reporting unit. This charge does not impact our compliance with our debt covenants or our cash flows, and is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. At the time we performed our interim goodwill impairment test, we estimated that our U.S. defibrillator market share would decrease approximately 400 basis points exiting 2010 as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions, as compared to our market share exiting 2009, and that these actions would negatively impact our 2010 U.S. CRM revenues by approximately $300 million. In addition, we expected that, our on-going U.S. CRM net sales and profitability would likely continue to be adversely impacted as a result of the ship hold and product removal actions. Therefore, as a result of these product actions, as well as lower expectations of market growth in new areas and increased competitive and other pricing pressures, we lowered our estimated average U.S. CRM net sales growth rates within our 15-year discounted cash flow (DCF) model, as well as our terminal 54 Table of Contents value growth rate, by approximately a couple of hundred basis points to derive the fair value of the U.S. CRM reporting unit. The reduction in our forecasted 2010 U.S. CRM net sales, the change in our expected sales growth rates thereafter and the reduction in profitability as a result of the recently enacted excise tax on medical device manufacturers were several key factors contributing to the impairment charge. Partially offsetting these factors was a 50 basis point reduction in our estimated market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital (WACC) used in determining our discount rate. In the second quarter of 2010, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for all of our reporting units. We updated our U.S. CRM assumptions to reflect our market share position at that time, our most recent operational budgets and long range strategic plans. In conjunction with our annual test, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, with the exception of our U.S. CRM reporting unit. Based on the remaining book value of our U.S. CRM reporting unit following the goodwill impairment charge, the carrying value of our U.S. CRM business unit continues to exceed its fair value, due primarily to the book value of amortizable intangible assets allocated to this reporting unit. The book value of our amortizable intangible assets which have been allocated to our U.S. CRM reporting unit is approximately $3.5 billion as of December 31, 2010. We tested these amortizable intangible assets for impairment on an undiscounted cash flow basis as of March 31, 2010, and determined that these assets were not impaired, and there have been no impairment indicators related to these assets subsequent to that test. The assumptions used in our annual goodwill impairment test related to our U.S. CRM reporting unit were substantially consistent with those used in our first quarter interim impairment test; therefore, it was not deemed necessary to proceed to the second step of the impairment test in the second quarter of 2010. In the fourth quarter of 2010, we performed an interim impairment test on our international reporting units as a result of the announced divestiture of our Neurovascular business. We allocated a portion of our goodwill from our each of our international reporting units to the Neurovascular business. We then tested each of our international reporting units for impairment in accordance with ASC Topic 350, Intangibles – Goodwill and Other. Our testing did not identify any reporting units whose carrying values exceeded their calculated fair values. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates for a discussion of our goodwill balances as of December 31, 2010, including our assessment of reporting units with a higher risk of future impairment. During the fourth quarter of 2008, the decline in our stock price and our market capitalization created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance. Therefore, we performed an interim impairment test and recorded a $2.613 billion goodwill impairment charge associated with our U.S. CRM reporting unit. The impact of economic conditions, and the related increase in volatility in the equity and credit markets, on our risk-adjusted weighted-average cost of capital, along with reductions in market demand for products in our U.S. CRM reporting unit relative to our assumptions at the time of our acquisition of Guidant, were the key factors contributing to the impairment charge. Intangible Asset Impairment Charges During the first quarter of 2010, due to lower than anticipated net sales of one of our Peripheral Interventions technology offerings, as well as changes in our expectations of future market acceptance of this technology, we lowered our sales forecasts associated with the product. In addition, during the third quarter of 2010, as part of our initiatives to reprioritize and diversify our product portfolio, we discontinued one of our internal research and development programs to focus on those with a higher likelihood of success. As a result of these factors, we tested the related intangible assets for impairment and recorded $65 million of intangible asset impairment charges during 2010 to write down the balance of these intangible assets to their fair value. We do not believe that these impairments, or the factors causing these impairments, will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows. In 2009, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $12 million, associated primarily with lower than anticipated market penetration of one of our Urology technology offerings. We do not believe that these impairments will have a material impact on our future operations or cash flows. 55 Table of Contents In 2008, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $177 million, including a $131 million write-down of certain of our Peripheral Interventions-related intangible assets, and a $46 million write-down of certain Urology-related intangible assets. We do not believe that the write-down of these assets will have a material impact on future operations or cash flows. These non-cash charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. Refer to Critical Accounting Estimates and Note D - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on our intangible asset impairment charges. Purchased Research and Development On January 1, 2009, we adopted the provisions of FASB Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations (codified within ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations). Among other changes to accounting for business combinations, Statement No. 141(R) superseded FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date. Statement No. 141(R) now requires that purchased research and development acquired in a business combination be recognized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. Accordingly, we have accounted for purchased research and development acquired in connection with our 2010 business combinations as intangible assets in our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Our policy is to record certain costs associated with strategic investments outside of business combinations as purchased research and development. Our adoption of Statement No. 141(R) (Topic 805) did not change this policy with respect to asset purchases. In accordance with this policy, we recorded purchased research and development charges of $21 million in 2009, associated with entering certain licensing and development arrangements. Since the technology purchases did not involve the transfer of processes or outputs as defined by Statement No. 141(R) (Topic 805), the transactions did not qualify as business combinations. In 2008, we recorded $43 million of purchased research and development charges, including $17 million associated with our acquisition of Labcoat, Ltd., $8 million attributable to our acquisition of CryoCor, Inc., and $18 million associated with entering certain licensing and development arrangements. These acquisition-related charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. Contingent Consideration Expense In connection with our 2010 acquisitions, we may be required to pay future consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of certain revenue-based milestones. As of the respective acquisition dates, we recorded total contingent liabilities of $69 million, representing the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration we expect to pay to the former shareholders of the acquired businesses. In accordance with ASC Topic 805, we re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates. During 2010, we recorded expense of $2 million representing the increase in the estimated fair value of this obligation. This acquisition-related charge is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. Acquisition-related Milestone In connection with Abbott Laboratories’ 2006 acquisition of Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, Abbott agreed to pay us a milestone payment of $250 million upon receipt of an approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) to market the XIENCE V® stent system in Japan. The MHLW approved the XIENCE V® stent system in the first quarter of 2010 and we received the 56 Table of Contents milestone payment from Abbott, which we recorded as a $250 million pre-tax gain. This non-recurring acquisition-related credit is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. Gain on Divestitures During 2008, we recorded a $250 million gain in connection with the sale of our Fluid Management and Venous Access businesses and our TriVascular EVAR program. This divestiture-related gain is excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance and assessing liquidity. Refer to Note C – Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these transactions. Restructuring Charges and Restructuring-related Activities In October 2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count reduction plan (the 2007 Restructuring plan). The plan was intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short- and long-term shareholder value. Key activities under the plan included the restructuring of several businesses, corporate functions and product franchises in order to better utilize resources, strengthen competitive positions, and create a more simplified and efficient business model; the elimination, suspension or reduction of spending on certain research and development projects; and the transfer of certain production lines among facilities. The execution of this plan enabled us to reduce research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately $500 million exiting 2008. We have partially reinvested our savings from these initiatives into targeted head count increases, primarily in customer-facing positions. In addition, the plan has reduced annualized run-rate reductions of manufacturing costs by approximately $35 million exiting 2010 as a result of transfers of certain production lines. We initiated activities under the plan in the fourth quarter of 2007. The transfer of certain production lines contemplated under the 2007 Restructuring plan was completed as of December 31, 2010; all other major activities under the plan, with the exception of final production line transfers, were completed as of December 31, 2009. The execution of this plan resulted in total pre-tax expenses of $427 million and required cash outlays of $380 million, of which we have paid $370 million to date. We recorded a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. The following provides a summary of total costs associated with the plan by major type of cost: Type of cost Total amount incurred Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $204 million Fixed asset write-offs $31 million Other (1) $67 million Restructuring-related expenses: Retention incentives $66 million Accelerated depreciation $16 million Transfer costs (2) $43 million $427 million (1) Consists primarily of consulting fees, contractual cancellations, relocation costs and other costs. (2) Consists primarily of costs to transfer product lines among facilities, including costs of transfer teams, freight and product line validations. In January 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a Plant Network Optimization program, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines among facilities and by closing certain other facilities. The program is a complement to our 2007 Restructuring plan, discussed above, and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins. We estimate that the program will result in annualized run-rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65 million exiting 2012. These savings are in addition to the estimated $35 million of annual reductions of manufacturing 57 Table of Contents costs from activities under our 2007 Restructuring plan. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012. Activities under the Plant Network Optimization program were initiated in the first quarter of 2009 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012. We expect that the execution of the Plant Network Optimization program will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $135 million to $150 million, and that approximately $115 million to $125 million of these charges will result in cash outlays, of which we have made payments of $40 million to date. We have recorded related costs of $79 million since the inception of the plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. The following provides a summary of our estimates of costs associated with the Plant Network Optimization program by major type of cost: Total estimated amount expected to Type of cost be incurred Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $30 million to $35 million Restructuring-related expenses: Accelerated depreciation $20 million to $25 million Transfer costs (1) $85 million to $90 million $135 million to $150 million (1) Consists primarily of costs to transfer product lines among facilities, including costs of transfer teams, freight, idle facility and product line validations. On February 6, 2010, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a series of management changes and restructuring initiatives (the 2010 Restructuring plan) designed to focus our business, drive innovation, accelerate profitable revenue growth and increase both accountability and shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the integration of our Cardiovascular and CRM businesses, as well as the restructuring of certain other businesses and corporate functions; the centralization of our research and development organization; the re-alignment of our international structure to reduce our administrative costs and invest in expansion opportunities including significant investments in emerging markets; and the reprioritization and diversification of our product portfolio. We estimate that the execution of this plan will result in gross reductions in pre-tax operating expenses of approximately $200 million to $250 million, once completed in 2012. We expect to reinvest a portion of the savings into customer-facing and other activities to help drive future sales growth and support the business. Activities under the 2010 Restructuring plan were initiated in the first quarter of 2010 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of 2012. We expect the execution of the 2010 Restructuring plan will result in the elimination of approximately 1,000 to 1,300 positions worldwide by the end of 2012. We estimate that the 2010 Restructuring plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $180 million to $200 million, and that approximately $165 million to $175 million of these charges will result in cash outlays, of which we have made payments of $69 million to date. We have recorded related costs of $110 million since the inception of the plan, and are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. The following provides a summary of our expected total costs associated with the plan by major type of cost: 58 Table of Contents Total estimated amount expected to Type of cost be incurred Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $95 million to $100 million Fixed asset write-offs $10 million to $15 million Other (1) $55 million to $60 million Restructuring-related expenses: Other (2) $20 million to $25 million $180 million to $200 million (1) Includes primarily consulting fees and costs associated with contractual cancellations. (2) Comprised of other costs directly related to restructuring plan, including accelerated depreciation and infrastructure-related costs. We recorded restructuring charges pursuant to our restructuring plans of $116 million during 2010, $63 million during 2009, and $78 million during 2008. In addition, we recorded expenses within other lines of our accompanying consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives of $53 million during 2010, $67 million during 2009, and $55 million during 2008. The following presents these costs by major type and line item within our 2010 consolidated statements of operations included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, as well as by program: Year Ended December 31, 2010 Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write-offs Other Total Restructuring charges $ 70 $ 11 $ 35 $ 116 Restructuring-related expenses: Cost of products sold $ 7 $ 41 48 Selling, general and administrative expenses 5 5 Research and development expenses 7 41 5 53 $ 70 $ 7 $ 41 $ 11 $ 40 $ 169 Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write-offs Other Total 2010 Restructuring plan $ 66 $ 11 $ 33 $ 110 Plant Network Optimization program 4 $ 7 $ 28 39 2007 Restructuring plan 13 7 20 $ 70 $ 7 $ 41 $ 11 $ 40 $ 169 Year Ended December 31, 2009 Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write-offs Other Total Restructuring charges $ 34 $ 13 $ 16 $ 63 Restructuring-related expenses: Cost of products sold $ 5 $ 8 $ 37 50 Selling, general and administrative expenses 10 3 1 14 Research and development expenses 3 3 18 11 37 1 67 $ 34 $ 18 $ 11 $ 37 $ 13 $ 17 $ 130 59 Table of Contents Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write-offs Other Total Plant Network Optimization program $ 22 $ 6 $ 12 $ 40 2007 Restructuring plan 12 $ 18 5 25 $ 13 $ 17 90 $ 34 $ 18 $ 11 $ 37 $ 13 $ 17 $ 130 Year Ended December 31, 2008 Termination Retention Accelerated Transfer Fixed Asset (in millions) Benefits Incentives Depreciation Costs Write-offs Other Total Restructuring charges $ 34 $ 10 $ 34 $ 78 Restructuring-related expenses: Cost of products sold $ 9 $ 4 $ 4 17 Selling, general and administrative expenses 27 4 31 Research and development expenses 7 7 43 8 4 55 $ 34 $ 43 $ 8 $ 4 $ 10 $ 34 $ 133 Restructuring and restructuring-related costs recorded in 2008 related entirely to our 2007 Restructuring plan. Termination benefits represent amounts incurred pursuant to our on-going benefit arrangements and amounts for one-time involuntary termination benefits, and have been recorded in accordance with ASC Topic 712, Compensation – Non-retirement Postemployment Benefits (formerly FASB Statement No. 112, Employer’s Accounting for Postemployment Benefits) and ASC Topic 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations (formerly FASB Statement 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities). We expect to record additional termination benefits related to our Plant Network Optimization program and 2010 Restructuring plan in 2011 and 2012 when we identify with more specificity the job classifications, functions and locations of the remaining head count to be eliminated. Retention incentives represent cash incentives, which were recorded over the service period during which eligible employees remained employed with us in order to retain the payment. Other restructuring costs, which represent primarily consulting fees, are being recorded as incurred in accordance with Topic 420. Accelerated depreciation is being recorded over the adjusted remaining useful life of the related assets, and production line transfer costs are being recorded as incurred. We have incurred cumulative restructuring charges of $433 million and restructuring-related costs of $183 million since we committed to each plan. The following presents these costs by major type and by plan: 2010 Plant 2007 Restructuring Network Restructuring (in millions) plan Optimization plan Total Termination benefits $ 66 $ 26 $ 204 $ 296 Fixed asset write-offs 11 31 42 Other 28 67 95 Total restructuring charges 105 26 302 433 Retention incentives 66 66 Accelerated depreciation 13 16 29 Transfer costs 40 43 83 Other 5 5 Restructuring-related expenses 5 53 125 183 $ 110 $ 79 $ 427 $ 616 60 Table of Contents We made total cash payments associated with restructuring initiatives pursuant to these plans of $133 million during 2010 and have made total cash payments of $479 million since committing to each plan. Each of these payments was made using cash generated from operations, and are comprised of the following: 2010 Plant 2007 Restructuring Network Restructuring (in millions) plan Optimization plan Total Year Ended December 31, 2010 Termination benefits $ 45 $ 16 $ 61 Retention incentives 2 2 Transfer costs $ 28 13 41 Other 24 5 29 $ 69 $ 28 $ 36 $ 133 Program to Date Termination benefits $ 45 $ 195 $ 240 Retention incentives 66 66 Transfer costs $ 40 43 83 Other 24 66 90 $ 69 $ 40 $ 370 $ 479 Litigation-related Net Charges We record certain significant litigation-related activity as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations, and these charges are excluded by management for purposes of evaluating operating performance. During 2010, we reached a settlement with Medinol Ltd., resolving the dispute we had with them that had been subject of arbitration before the American Arbitration Association. Under the terms of the settlement, we received proceeds of $104 million from Medinol, which we recorded as a pre-tax gain in our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. In 2009, we recorded litigation-related net charges of $2.022 billion, associated primarily with an agreement to settle three patent disputes with Johnson & Johnson for $1.725 billion, plus interest. In addition, in 2009, we reached an agreement in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice, which was formally accepted by the District Court in 2011, under which we paid $296 million in January 2011 in order resolve the U.S. Government investigation of Guidant Corporation related to product advisories issued in 2005. We recorded a net charge of $294 million related to this matter in 2009, representing $296 million associated with the agreement, net of a $2 million reversal of a related accrual. Further, in 2009, we reduced previously recorded reserves associated with certain litigation-related matters following certain favorable court rulings, resulting in a credit of $60 million and recorded a pre-tax charge of $50 million associated with the settlement of all outstanding litigation with Bruce Saffran, M.D., Ph.D. In 2008, we recorded litigation-related charges of $334 million as a result of a ruling by a federal judge in a patent infringement case brought against us by Johnson & Johnson. This charge was in addition to previous charges related to this matter. In 2009, we made the associated settlement payment of $716 million, including penalties and interest. See discussion of our material legal proceedings in Note L – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Interest Expense Our interest expense decreased to $393 million in 2010, as compared to $407 million in 2009. The decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels, due to term loan prepayments throughout 2009, as well as the 2010 prepayment of our $900 million loan from Abbott Laboratories and a slight decrease in our average borrowing rate. Our average borrowing rate was 6.0 percent in 2010 and 6.1 percent in 2009. In addition, our 2010 interest expense included $15 million of write-offs of debt issuance costs and impacts of the early termination of interest rate contracts associated with term loan prepayments during the year, as compared to $34 million in 2009. These decreases were partially offset by the write-off of the related remaining $10 million discount attributable to 61 Table of Contents the Abbott loan upon prepayment. Refer to the Liquidity and Capital Resources section and Note G – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding our debt obligations. Our interest expense decreased to $407 million in 2009, as compared to $468 million in 2008. The decrease in our interest expense was a result of lower average debt levels, due to term loan repayments during 2009. Partially offsetting these decreases were losses of $27 million associated with the early termination of interest rate contracts for which there was no longer an underlying exposure and the write-off of $7 million of debt issuance costs following prepayments of our term loan, as well as a slight increase in our average borrowing rate. Our average borrowing rate was 6.1 percent in 2009 and 6.0 percent in 2008. Other, net Our other, net reflected expense of $14 million in 2010, $7 million in 2009, and $58 million in 2008. The following are the components of other, net: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Interest income $ 13 $ 7 $ 47 Foreign currency (losses) gains (9 ) (5 ) 5 Net (losses) gains on investments and notes receivable (12 ) 3 (93 ) Other expense, net (6 ) (12 ) (17 ) $ (14 ) $ (7 ) $ (58 ) Our interest income increased in 2010, as compared to 2009, due primarily to the collection of interest on outstanding accounts receivable. Our interest income decreased in 2009, as compared to 2008, due primarily to lower average investment rates available in the market, as well as lower average cash balances. Other, net included net losses of $12 million in 2010, net gains of $3 million in 2009 and net losses of $93 million in 2008, associated with our investment portfolio. The $93 million of losses in 2008 relate primarily to the sale of our non-strategic investments, described in Note F – Investments and Notes Receivable to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Tax Rate The following provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2010 2009 2008 vs. 2009 vs. 2008 Reported tax rate 0.2 % (21.6 ) % 0.2 % 21.8 % (21.8 ) % Impact of certain receipts/ charges 18.0 % 39.1 % 18.9 % (21.1 ) % 20.2 % 18.2 % 17.5 % 19.1 % 0.7 % (1.6 ) % The change in our reported tax rate for 2010, as compared to 2009, and 2009, as compared to 2008, relates primarily to the impact of certain receipts and charges that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. In 2010, these receipts and charges included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, a gain associated with the receipt of an acquisition-related milestone payment, a gain associated with a litigation-related settlement receipt, and restructuring-related charges. Our reported tax rate was also net favorably affected by discrete items, related primarily to the re-measurement of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable court ruling issued in a similar third-party case, a resolution of an uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar third-party case as well as conclusion of the appeals process for the federal examination for certain years. In 2009, these receipts and charges included intangible asset impairment charges, purchased research and development charges, restructuring and litigation-related net charges, a favorable tax ruling on a divestiture-related gain recognized in a prior period, and discrete tax items associated primarily with resolutions of uncertain tax positions related to audit settlements and changes in estimates for tax benefits 62 Table of Contents claimed related to prior periods. In 2008, these charges included gains and losses associated with the divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses and investments, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, litigation-related charges. Changes in the geographic mix of our sales also impacted our reported tax rate in 2010, as compared to 2009, and in 2009, as compared to 2008. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. We have concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through 2000 and substantially all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters through 2001. We resolved a number of foreign examinations during 2010. As a result of these activities, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $9 million, inclusive of $3 million of interest and penalties. In addition, as a result of the expiration of statutes of limitations in various foreign and state jurisdictions, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $20 million, inclusive of $7 million of interest and penalties. Further, during 2010, we concluded the appeals process for the federal tax examination for Boston Scientific (excluding Guidant) covering years 2002-2005 and decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $72 million, inclusive of $21 million of interest and penalties, net of payments. We also re-measured an uncertain tax position due to a favorable court ruling issued in a similar third-party case and resolved another uncertain tax position resulting from a favorable taxpayer motion issued in a similar third-party case, which resulted in a decrease of $91 million, inclusive of $25 million of interest and penalties. During 2009, we received favorable foreign court decisions and resolved certain foreign matters. As a result of these activities, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $20 million, inclusive of $7 million of interest and penalties. In addition, statutes of limitations expired in various foreign and state jurisdictions, as a result, decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions by $29 million, inclusive of interest and penalties. We also resolved certain litigation-related matters, described in our 2009 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. Based on the outcome of the settlements, we reassessed the reserve for uncertain tax positions previously recorded on certain positions and decreased our reserve by $22 million, inclusive of $1 million of interest. During 2008, we resolved certain matters in federal, state, and foreign jurisdictions for Guidant and Boston Scientific for the years 1998- 2005. We settled multiple federal issues at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) examination and Appellate levels, including issues related to Guidant’s acquisition of Intermedics, Inc., and various litigation settlements, described in Note L – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, or our 2009 Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. We also received favorable foreign court decisions and a favorable outcome related to our foreign research credit claims. As a result of these audit activities, we decreased our reserve for uncertain tax positions, excluding tax payments, by $156 million, inclusive of $37 million of interest and penalties. On December 17, 2010, we received Notices of Deficiency from the IRS reflecting proposed audit adjustments for Guidant Corporation for the 2001-2003 tax years. The incremental tax liability asserted by the IRS is $525 million, plus interest. The primary issue in dispute is the transfer pricing used in connection with the technology license agreements between domestic and foreign subsidiaries of Guidant. We believe we have meritorious defenses for our tax filings and we intend to file a petition to the U.S. Tax Court in early 2011. No payments will be made on the issue until it is resolved, which may take several years. We believe that our income tax reserves associated with this matter are adequate and the final resolution will not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. However, both the final resolution and potential impact of that resolution are uncertain and could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The federal tax returns of Guidant Corporation for the 2004 through April 2006 tax years and of Boston Scientific Corporation for the 2006-2007 tax years are currently under examination by the IRS. The relevant statutes of limitations for these examinations expire during December 2011 and September 2011, respectively. We do not anticipate that at the conclusion of these examinations, we will be able to reach an agreement with the IRS regarding our federal tax liabilities for these years. We expect that final resolution of these tax liabilities will require that we avail ourselves of applicable IRS appellate and judicial procedures, as appropriate. 63 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2010, we had $213 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, comprised of $105 million invested in prime money market and government funds, $16 million invested in short-term time deposits, and $92 million in interest bearing and non-interest bearing bank accounts. Our policy is to invest excess cash in short-term marketable securities earning a market rate of interest without assuming undue risk to principal, and we limit our direct exposure to securities in any one industry or issuer. Subsequent to year-end, in January 2011, we closed the sale of our Neurovascular business to Stryker Corporation and received pre-tax proceeds of $1.450 billion at closing, including an upfront payment of $1.426 billion, and $24 million, which was placed into escrow to be released upon the completion of local closings in certain foreign jurisdictions, and will receive $50 million contingent upon the transfer or separation of certain manufacturing facilities, which we expect will be completed over a period of approximately 24 months. In January 2011, we paid at maturity $250 million of our senior notes, and a $296 million litigation-related settlement associated with the U.S. Department of Justice matter described previously, using cash on hand. We also have full access to our $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. The following provides a summary and description of our cash inflows (outflows) for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Cash provided by operating activities $ 325 $ 835 $ 1,216 Cash (used for) provided by investing activities (480 ) (793 ) 324 Cash used for financing activities (496 ) (820 ) (1,350 ) Operating Activities During 2010, cash provided by operating activities was $325 million, as compared to $835 million in 2009, a decrease of $510 million. This decrease was driven primarily by the payment of $1.725 billion to Johnson & Johnson related to a patent litigation settlement, as compared to approximately $837 million of legal settlements paid in 2009. This cash outflow was partially offset by the receipt of a $250 million milestone payment from Abbott and $104 million received in connection with a litigation settlement with Medinol, each described in Results of Operations. During 2009, cash provided by operating activities was $835 million, as compared to $1.216 billion in 2008, a decrease of $381 million. This decrease was due primarily to litigation-related payments of $837 million, consisting primarily of payments to Johnson & Johnson associated with patent litigation settlements. These cash outflows were partially offset by lower net tax payments of $370 million and lower interest payments of $50 million, due to lower average debt balances, as well as improvements in working capital. Investing Activities During 2010, our investing activities were comprised primarily of capital expenditures of $272 million, as well as payments of approximately $200 million to acquire Asthmatx, Inc. and certain other strategic assets, described in Note B – Acquisitions to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We expect to incur total capital expenditures of approximately $300 million to $350 million during 2011, which includes capital expenditures to further upgrade our information systems infrastructure, and to enhance our manufacturing capabilities to support continued growth in our business units. During 2009, our investing activities included $523 million of payments related to prior period acquisitions, comprised primarily of a final fixed payment of approximately $500 million related to our prior period acquisition of Advanced Bionics Corporation, described in Note B – Acquisitions to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Our investing activities in 2009 also included capital expenditures of $312 million, payments for investments in privately held companies, and acquisitions of 64 Table of Contents businesses and certain technology rights of $54 million, which were offset by proceeds from the sale of investments in, and collection of notes receivable from, certain publicly traded and privately held companies, of $91 million. During 2008, our investing activities included proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion associated with the divestiture of certain businesses, and $149 million of proceeds associated with the sale of investments and collections of notes receivable. These cash inflows were partially offset by $675 million in payments related to prior period acquisitions, associated primarily with Advanced Bionics; and $39 million of net cash payments for investments in privately held companies, and acquisitions of certain technology rights. In addition, we made capital expenditures of $362 million and paid $21 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire CryoCor, Inc. and $17 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire Labcoat, Ltd. Refer to Note F – Investments and Notes Receivable and Note B – Acquisitions to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding these transactions. Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt and proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs. Debt We made payments on debt, net of proceeds from borrowings, of $527 million in 2010, $853 million in 2009, and $1.425 billion in 2008, and had total debt of $5.438 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $5.918 billion as of December 31, 2009. The debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2010 is as follows: (in millions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Term loan $ 250 $ 50 $ 700 $ 1,000 Senior notes 250 $ 600 $ 1,250 $ 2,350 4,450 $ 500 $ 50 $ 700 $ 600 $ 1,250 $ 2,350 $ 5,450 Note: The table above does not include discounts associated with our senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate contracts used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes. There were no amounts borrowed under our credit facilities as of December 31, 2010 or December 31, 2009. As of December 31, 2010, we had outstanding letters of credit of $120 million, as compared to $123 million as of December 31, 2009, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers’ compensation insurance arrangements. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees; accordingly, we have not recognized a related liability for our outstanding letters of credit in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2010 or 2009. We believe we will generate sufficient cash from operations and intend to fund these payments without drawing on the letters of credit. In January 2011, we paid at maturity $250 million of our senior notes; in addition, we borrowed $250 million under our credit and security facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables and used the proceeds to pre-pay all $100 million of our 2011 term loan maturities and $150 million of our 2012 term loan maturities. These prepayments are reflected as ‘current’ in the table above, as well as in our consolidated balance sheets included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. As a result, quarterly principal payments of $50 million will commence in the fourth quarter of 2012. 65 Table of Contents Our revolving credit facility agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants, as follows: Actual as of Covenant December 31, Requirement 2010 Maximum leverage ratio (1) 3.85 times 2.3 times Minimum interest coverage ratio (2) 3.0 times 6.1 times (1) Ratio of total debt to consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters. Requirement decreases to 3.5 times after March 31, 2011. (2) Ratio of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, to interest expense for the preceding four consecutive fiscal quarters. The credit agreement provides for an exclusion from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, through the credit agreement maturity, of up to $258 million in restructuring charges and restructuring-related expenses related to our previously-announced restructuring plans, plus an additional $300 million for any future restructuring initiatives. As of December 31, 2010, we had $470 million of the aggregate restructuring charge exclusion remaining. In addition, any litigation-related charges and credits are excluded from the calculation of consolidated EBITDA until such items are paid or received; as well as up to $1.5 billion of any future cash payments for future litigation settlements or damage awards (net of any litigation payments received); and litigation-related cash payments (net of cash receipts) of up to $1.310 billion related to amounts that were recorded in the financial statements as of March 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2010, we had $2.154 billion of the aggregate legal payment exclusion remaining. As of and through December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Our inability to maintain compliance with these covenants could require us to seek to renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. Further, there can be no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers. Equity During 2010, we received $31 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $33 million in 2009 and $71 million in 2008. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees. Stock-based compensation expense related to our stock ownership plans was $150 million in 2010, $144 million in 2009, and $138 million in 2008. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2010. Payments Due by Period (in millions) 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total Litigation settlements $ 296 $ 296 Long-term debt obligations 500 $ 50 $ 700 $ 600 $ 1,250 $ 2,350 5,450 Interest payments (1) 286 280 262 229 193 1,300 2,550 Operating lease obligations (1) 83 69 46 24 15 45 282 Purchase obligations (1) 205 51 8 4 1 2 271 Minimum royalty obligations (1) 13 1 1 1 1 3 20 Unrecognized tax benefits 8 8 $ 1,391 $ 451 $ 1,017 $ 858 $ 1,460 $ 3,700 $ 8,877 (1) In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. 66 Table of Contents The litigation settlement obligation noted above relates to our settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice for $296 million, discussed in Note L – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report, and was paid in January 2011. Refer to Note G – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding our debt obligations and associated interest obligations. The amounts in the table above with respect to operating lease obligations represent amounts pursuant to contractual arrangements for the lease of property, plant and equipment used in the normal course of business. Purchase obligations relate primarily to non-cancellable inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. Royalty obligations reported above represent minimum contractual obligations under our current royalty agreements. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.242 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note K – Income Taxes to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits. Certain of our acquisitions involve the potential payment of contingent consideration, including our 2010 acquisition of Asthmatx, Inc. The table above does not reflect any such obligations, as the timing and amounts are uncertain. See Note B – Acquisitions to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with prior acquisitions. Legal Matters The medical device market in which we primarily participate is largely technology driven. Physician customers, particularly in interventional cardiology, have historically moved quickly to new products and new technologies. As a result, intellectual property rights, particularly patents and trade secrets, play a significant role in product development and differentiation. However, intellectual property litigation is inherently complex and unpredictable. Furthermore, appellate courts can overturn lower court patent decisions. In addition, competing parties frequently file multiple suits to leverage patent portfolios across product lines, technologies and geographies and to balance risk and exposure between the parties. In some cases, several competitors are parties in the same proceeding, or in a series of related proceedings, or litigate multiple features of a single class of devices. These forces frequently drive settlement not only for individual cases, but also for a series of pending and potentially related and unrelated cases. In addition, although monetary and injunctive relief is typically sought, remedies and restitution are generally not determined until the conclusion of the trial court proceedings and can be modified on appeal. Accordingly, the outcomes of individual cases are difficult to time, predict or quantify and are often dependent upon the outcomes of other cases in other geographies. Several third parties have asserted that certain of our current and former product offerings infringe patents owned or licensed by them. We have similarly asserted that other products sold by our competitors infringe patents owned or licensed by us. Adverse outcomes in one or more of the proceedings against us could limit our ability to sell certain products in certain jurisdictions, or reduce our operating margin on the sale of these products and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. In particular, although we have resolved multiple litigation matters with Johnson & Johnson, we continue to be involved in patent litigation with them, particularly relating to drug-eluting stent systems. Adverse outcomes in one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell certain products and on our operating margins, financial position, results of operation or liquidity. In the normal course of business, product liability, securities and commercial claims are asserted against us. Similar claims may be asserted against us in the future related to events not known to management at the present time. We are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims and intellectual property infringement, and maintain an insurance policy providing limited coverage against securities claims. The absence 67 Table of Contents of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our potential exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. Product liability claims, securities and commercial litigation, and other legal proceedings in the future, regardless of their outcome, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In addition, the medical device industry is the subject of numerous governmental investigations often involving regulatory, marketing and other business practices. These investigations could result in the commencement of civil and criminal proceedings, substantial fines, penalties and administrative remedies, divert the attention of our management and have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $588 million as of December 31, 2010 and $2.316 billion as of December 31, 2009, and includes estimated costs of settlement, damages and defense. The decrease in our accrual is due primarily to the payment of $1.725 billion to Johnson & Johnson in connection with the patent litigation settlement discussed in Note L – Commitments and Contingencies to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts, if any, that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued and paid in the future, which could materially adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and our ability to comply with our debt covenants. See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Note L. Critical Accounting Estimates Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (U.S. GAAP). We describe these accounting polices in Note A–Significant Accounting Policies to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities as of the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring management’s judgment that we consider critical: Revenue Recognition We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record these amounts as a reduction of revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. For these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue on the sale of the earlier generation product based upon an estimate of the amount to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to sales returns and could cause actual returns to differ from these estimates. Many of our CRM product offerings combine the sale of a device with our LATITUDE® Patient Management System, which represents a future service obligation. In accordance with accounting guidance regarding multiple-element arrangements applicable through December 31, 2010, we deferred revenue on the undelivered service element based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value, using the residual method of allocation, and recognized the associated revenue over the related service period. The use of an alternative method of allocation or estimate of fair value could result in a different amount of revenue deferral in any given period. On January 1, 2011, we adopted ASC Update No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605)- Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. The consensus in Update No. 2009-13 supersedes certain guidance in Topic 605 (formerly Emerging 68 Table of Contents Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00-21, Multiple-Element Arrangements). Update No. 2009-13 provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables, including requiring the use of the relative selling price method. The adoption of Update No. 2009-13 did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. Inventory Provisions We base our provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess, expired and obsolete inventory in the future. Further, the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess, expired and obsolete inventory. Valuation of Intangible Assets We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination, including purchased research and development, on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management, which consider management’s best estimates of inputs and assumptions that a market participant would use. Further, for those arrangements that involve potential future contingent consideration, we record on the date of acquisition a liability equal to the discounted fair value of the estimated additional consideration we may be obligated to make in the future. We re-measure this liability each reporting period and record changes in the fair value through a separate line item within our consolidated statements of operations. Increases or decreases in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability can result from changes in discount periods and rates, as well as changes in the timing and amount of revenue estimates. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections; growth rates; cash flows and discount rates and alternative estimated useful life assumptions, or probabilities surrounding the achievement of clinical, regulatory or revenue-based milestones could result in different purchase price allocations and amortization expense in current and future periods. We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. If an impairment indicator exists, we test the intangible asset for recoverability. If the carrying value of the intangible asset is not recoverable, as discussed in Note A, we will write the carrying value down to fair value in the period identified. In addition, we test our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets. To test our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we calculate the fair value of these assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, we write the carrying value down to the fair value. We generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset (asset group). The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. Goodwill Valuation We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination to goodwill. We test our April 1 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the assessment, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under ASC 69 Table of Contents Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (formerly FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets). The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. We assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment, referred to as a component. We determine our reporting units by first identifying our operating segments, and then assess whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. We aggregate components within an operating segment that have similar economic characteristics. For our April 1, 2010 annual impairment assessment, we identified our reporting units to be our seven U.S. operating segments, which in aggregate make up the U.S. reportable segment, and our four international operating segments. When allocating goodwill from business combinations to our reporting units, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination at the time of acquisition. In addition, for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets, which relate to a reporting unit’s operations, and would be considered in determining its fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit. During 2010, 2009, and 2008, we used only the income approach, specifically the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, to derive the fair value of each of our reporting units in preparing our goodwill impairment assessment. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to a reporting unit and then discounting these after-tax cash flows to a present value using a risk-adjusted discount rate. We selected this method as being the most meaningful in preparing our goodwill assessments because we believe the income approach most appropriately measures our income producing assets. We have considered using the market approach and cost approach but concluded they are not appropriate in valuing our reporting units given the lack of relevant market comparisons available for application of the market approach and the inability to replicate the value of the specific technology-based assets within our reporting units for application of the cost approach. Therefore, we believe that the income approach represents the most appropriate valuation technique for which sufficient data is available to determine the fair value of our reporting units. In applying the income approach to our accounting for goodwill, we make assumptions about the amount and timing of future expected cash flows, terminal value growth rates and appropriate discount rates. The amount and timing of future cash flows within our DCF analysis is based on our most recent operational budgets, long range strategic plans and other estimates. The terminal value growth rate is used to calculate the value of cash flows beyond the last projected period in our DCF analysis and reflects our best estimates for stable, perpetual growth of our reporting units. We use estimates of market-participant risk-adjusted weighted-average costs of capital (WACC) as a basis for determining the discount rates to apply to our reporting units’ future expected cash flows. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we then perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value. If we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated, we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate. We would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods, once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test. Although we use consistent methodologies in developing the assumptions and estimates underlying the fair value calculations used in our impairment tests, these estimates are uncertain by nature and can vary from actual results. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated revenue projections, growth rates, cash flows and discount rates could result in different fair value estimates. We have identified a total of four reporting units with a material amount of goodwill that are at higher risk of potential failure of the first step of the goodwill impairment test in future reporting periods. These reporting units include our U.S. CRM unit, which holds $1.5 billion of allocated goodwill, our U.S. Cardiovascular unit, which holds $2.2 billion of allocated goodwill, our U.S. Neuromodulation unit, which holds $1.2 billion of allocated 70 Table of Contents goodwill, and our EMEA unit, which holds $3.9 billion of allocated goodwill. The level of excess fair value over carrying value for these reporting units identified as being at higher risk (with the exception of the U.S. CRM reporting unit, whose carrying value continues to exceed its fair value) ranged from approximately six percent to 23 percent. On a quarterly basis, we monitor the key drivers of fair value for these reporting units to detect changes that would warrant an interim impairment test. The key variables that drive the fair value of our reporting units are estimated revenue growth rates, levels of profitability and perpetual growth rate assumptions, as well as the WACC. These assumptions are subject to uncertainty, including our ability to grow revenue and improve profitability levels. For each of these reporting units, relatively small declines in the future performance and cash flows of the reporting unit or small changes in other key assumptions may result in the recognition of significant goodwill impairment charges. For example, keeping all other variables constant, a 50 basis point increase in the WACC applied would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for our U.S. CRM, U.S. Neuromodulation, and EMEA reporting units failing the first step of the goodwill impairment test. In addition, keeping all other variables constant, a 100 basis point decrease in perpetual growth rates would require that we perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test for all four of the reporting units with higher risk of impairment. The estimates used for our future cash flows and discount rates are our best estimates and we believe they are reasonable, but future declines in the business performance of our reporting units may impair the recoverability of our goodwill. See Note D – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our 2010 and 2008 goodwill impairment charges, as well as a discussion of future events that could have a negative impact on the fair value of these reporting units. Income Taxes We provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the final outcome of these matters may be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, the availability of deferred tax liabilities and tax carrybacks, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years. New Accounting Pronouncements Standards Implemented ASC Update No. 2010-06 In January 2010, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2010-06, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (Topic 820) – Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements. Update No. 2010-06 requires additional disclosure within the rollforward of activity for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, including transfers of assets and liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy and the separate presentation of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of assets and liabilities within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, Update No. 2010-06 requires enhanced disclosures of the valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurements within Level 2 and Level 3. We adopted Update No. 2010-06 for our first quarter ended March 31, 2010, except for the disclosure of purchases, sales, issuances and settlements of Level 3 measurements, for which disclosures will be required for our first quarter ending March 31, 2011. During 2010, we did not have any transfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note E – Fair Value Measurements to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for 71 Table of Contents disclosures surrounding our fair value measurements, including information regarding the valuation techniques and inputs used in fair value measurements for assets and liabilities within Level 2 and Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. ASC Update No. 2009-17 In December 2009, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2009-17, Consolidations (Topic 810) – Improvements to Financial Reporting by Enterprises Involved with Variable Interest Entities, which formally codifies FASB Statement No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R). Update No. 2009-17 and Statement No. 167 amend Interpretation No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, to require that an enterprise perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise’s variable interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity (VIE). The analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both 1) the power to direct activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance and 2) the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity. Update No. 2009-17 eliminated the quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a VIE and requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary. We adopted Update No. 2009-17 for our first quarter ended March 31, 2010. The adoption of Update No. 2009-17 did not have any impact on our results of operations or financial position. ASC Update No. 2010-20 In July 2010, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2010-20, Receivables (Topic 310) - Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. Update No. 2010-20 requires expanded qualitative and quantitative disclosures about financing receivables, including trade accounts receivable, with respect to credit quality and credit losses, including a rollforward of the allowance for credit losses. The enhanced disclosure requirements are generally effective for interim and annual periods ending after December 15, 2010. We adopted Update No. 2010-20 for our year ended December 31, 2010, except for the rollforward of the allowance for credit losses, for which disclosure will be required for our first quarter ending March 31, 2011. Refer to Note A – Significant Account Policies to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for disclosures surrounding concentrations of credit risk and our policies with respect to the monitoring of the credit quality of customer accounts. Standards to be Implemented ASC Update No. 2009-13 In October 2009, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2009-13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605 )- Multiple-Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. The consensus in Update No. 2009-13 supersedes certain guidance in Topic 605 (formerly EITF Issue No. 00-21, Multiple-Element Arrangements). Update No. 2009-13 provides principles and application guidance to determine whether multiple deliverables exist, how the individual deliverables should be separated and how to allocate the revenue in the arrangement among those separate deliverables. Update No. 2009-13 also expands the disclosure requirements for multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements. We adopted Update No. 2009-13 as of January 1, 2011. The adoption did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position. ASC Update No. 2010-29 In December 2010, the FASB issued ASC Update No. 2010-29, Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations. Update No. 2010-29 clarifies paragraph 805-10-50-2(h) to require public entities that enter into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis to disclose pro forma information for such business combinations that occurred in the current reporting period, including pro forma revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the acquisition date had been as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. We are required to adopt Update No. 2010-29 for material business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2011. 72 Table of Contents Additional Information Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Use and Economic Substance of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Used by Boston Scientific To supplement our consolidated financial statements presented on a GAAP basis, we disclose certain non-GAAP measures, including adjusted net income and adjusted net income per share that exclude certain amounts, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange. These non-GAAP measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The GAAP measure most comparable to adjusted net income is GAAP net income (loss); the GAAP measure most comparable to adjusted net income per share is GAAP net income (loss) per share. To calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange, we convert actual current-period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant foreign exchange rates. The GAAP measure most comparable to this non-GAAP measure is growth rate percentages based on GAAP revenue. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP measure are included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Management uses these supplemental non-GAAP measures to evaluate performance period over period, to analyze the underlying trends in our business, to assess our performance relative to our competitors, and to establish operational goals and forecasts that are used in allocating resources and determining compensation. In addition, management uses these non-GAAP measures to further its understanding of the performance of operating segments. The adjustments excluded from our non-GAAP measures are consistent with those excluded from our reportable segments’ measure of profit or loss. These adjustments are excluded from the segment measures that are reported to our Chief Operating Decision Maker and are used to make operating decisions and assess performance. The following is an explanation of each of the adjustments that management excluded as part of its non-GAAP measures for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, as well as reasons for excluding each of these individual items: • Goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges - These amounts represent non-cash write-downs of the goodwill balance attributable to our U.S. Cardiac Rhythm Management business, as well as certain intangible assets balances. Following our acquisition of Guidant Corporation in 2006, and the related increase in debt, we have heightened our focus on cash generation and debt pay down. We remove the impact of these charges from operating performance to assist in assessing cash generated from operations. We believe this is a critical metric in measuring our ability to generate cash and pay down debt. Therefore, these charges are excluded from management’s assessment of operating performance and are also excluded from the measures used to set employee compensation. Accordingly, management believes this may be useful information to users of its financial statements and therefore has excluded these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity. 73 Table of Contents • Acquisition-related charges (credits) - These adjustments consist of (a) purchased research and development charges, (b) contingent consideration expense, (c) gains on acquisition-related milestone receipts, (d) due diligence and other fees, and (e) inventory step-up adjustments. Purchased research and development is a highly variable charge based on the extent and nature of external technology acquisitions during the period. Contingent consideration expense represents accounting adjustments to state our contingent consideration liabilities at their estimated fair value. These adjustments can be highly variable depending on the assessed likelihood of making future contingent consideration payments. In addition, contingent consideration expense was not recognized based on accounting principles in place previous to 2009, and, therefore, is not comparable to periods prior to 2009. Acquisition-related gains resulted from receipts related to Guidant Corporation’s sale of its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott Laboratories, and are not indicative of future operating results. Due diligence and other fees include legal, tax and other one time expenses associated with recent acquisitions that are not representative of on-going operations. Inventory step-up adjustments are non-cash charges related to acquired inventory directly attributable to acquisitions and is not indicative of the our on-going operations, or on-going cost of products sold. Management therefore removes the impact of these (credits) charges from our operating results to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance. • Divestiture-related charges (credits) – These amounts represent fees associated with business divestitures and gains and related tax impacts that we recognized related to the sale of certain non-strategic investments. These gains and losses are not indicative of future operating performance and are not used by management to assess operating performance. Accordingly, management excludes these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance. • Restructuring and restructuring-related costs - These adjustments represent costs associated with our 2010 Restructuring plan, Plant Network Optimization program and 2007 Restructuring plan. These expenses are excluded by management in assessing operating performance, as well as from our operating segments’ measures of profit and loss used for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Accordingly, management excludes these charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and a comparison to past operating performance. • Litigation-related net (credits) charges - These amounts are attributable to certain significant patent litigation and other legal matters, none of which reflect expected on-going operating expenses. Accordingly, management excluded these (credits) charges for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and for comparison to past operating performance. • Discrete tax items - These items represent adjustments of certain tax positions, which were initially established in prior periods as a result of acquisition-, divestiture-, restructuring- or litigation-related charges (credits). These adjustments do not reflect expected on-going operating results. Accordingly, management excludes these amounts for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and for comparison to past operating performance. • Amortization expense - Amortization expense is a non-cash charge and does not impact our liquidity or compliance with the covenants included in our debt agreements. Management removes the impact of amortization from our operating performance to assist in assessing cash generated from operations. Management believes this is a critical metric in measuring our ability to generate cash and pay down debt. Therefore, amortization expense is excluded from management’s assessment of operating performance and is also excluded from the measures management uses to set employee compensation. Accordingly, management believes this may be useful information to users of its financial statements and therefore excludes amortization expense for purposes of calculating these non-GAAP measures to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance, particularly in terms of liquidity. 74 Table of Contents • Foreign exchange on net sales - The impact of foreign exchange is highly variable and difficult to predict. Accordingly, management excludes the impact of foreign exchange for purposes of reviewing regional and divisional revenue growth rates to facilitate an evaluation of current operating performance and comparison to past operating performance. Material Limitations Associated with the Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange may have limitations as analytical tools, and these non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation from or as a replacement for GAAP financial measures. Some of the limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures are: • Amortization expense and goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, though not directly affecting our cash flows, represent a net reduction in value of goodwill and other intangible assets. The net loss associated with this reduction in value is not included in our adjusted net income or adjusted net income per diluted share and therefore these measures do not reflect the full effect of the reduction in value of those assets. • Acquisition- and divestiture-related charges (credits) reflect economic costs and benefits and are not reflected in adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share. • Items such as restructuring and restructuring-related costs, litigation-related net (credits) charges, and discrete tax items that are excluded from adjusted net income and adjusted net income per diluted share can have a material impact on cash flows and GAAP net income (loss) and net income (loss) per diluted share. • Revenue growth rates stated on a constant currency basis, by their nature, exclude the impact of foreign exchange, which may have a material impact on GAAP net sales. • Other companies may calculate adjusted net income, adjusted net income per diluted share, or regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange differently than us, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. Compensation for Limitations Associated with Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures We compensate for the limitations on non-GAAP financial measures by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of performance. The non-GAAP measures focus instead upon the core business, which is only a subset, albeit a critical one, of overall performance. We provide detailed reconciliations of each non-GAAP financial measure to its most directly comparable GAAP measure elsewhere in this Annual Report, and encourage investors to review these reconciliations. Usefulness of Non-GAAP Financial Measures to Investors We believe that presenting adjusted net income, adjusted net income per share, and regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of foreign exchange, in addition to the related GAAP measures, provides investors greater transparency to the information used by management for its financial and operational decision-making and allows investors to see our results “through the eyes” of management. We further believe that providing this information better enables our investors to understand our operating performance and to evaluate the methodology used by management to evaluate and measure such performance.

We designed our internal control process to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control–Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2010, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ J. Raymond Elliott /s/ Jeffrey D. Capello J. Raymond Elliott Jeffrey D. Capello President and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 77 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific Corporation We have audited Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 17, 2011 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 17, 2011 78 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $5.077 billion as of December 31, 2010 and $4.742 billion as of December 31, 2009. We recorded $82 million of other assets and $189 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments as of December 31, 2010, as compared to $56 million of other assets and $110 million of other liabilities as of December 31, 2009. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $297 million as of December 31, 2010 and $271 million as of December 31, 2009. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $363 million as of December 31, 2010 and by $331 million as of December 31, 2009. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction, resulting in minimal impact on our consolidated statements of operations. Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings, partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments, or ‘net debt.’ As of December 31, 2010, $4.433 billion of our outstanding debt obligations, or approximately 85 percent of our net debt, was at fixed interest rates. We did not have any interest rate derivative instruments outstanding as of December 31, 2010 or 2009. In the first quarter of 2011, we entered interest rate derivative contracts having a notional amount of $850 million to convert fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. See Note E – Fair Value Measurements to our 2010 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further information regarding our derivative financial instruments. 79 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific Corporation We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010. Our audits also included the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2. These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and schedule based on our audits. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Boston Scientific Corporation at December 31, 2010 and 2009, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2010, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the related financial statement schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth therein. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2010, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 17, 2011, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 17, 2011 80 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:42:28.016201
885725,BSX,BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORP,2005,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Boston Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties including interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions, vascular surgery, electrophysiology, neurovascular intervention, oncology, endoscopy, urology, gynecology and neuromodulation. Our mission is to improve the quality of patient care and the productivity of healthcare delivery through the development and advocacy of less-invasive medical devices and procedures. This mission is accomplished through the continuing refinement of existing products and procedures and the investigation and development of new technologies that can reduce risk, trauma, cost, procedure time and the need for 19 Table of Contents aftercare. Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) begins with an executive summary that outlines our financial highlights during 2004 and focuses on the impact of drug-eluting stents to our operations. Following the executive summary is an examination of the material changes in our operating results for 2004 as compared to 2003 and our operating results for 2003 as compared to 2002. The discussion then provides an examination of liquidity, focusing primarily on material changes in our operating, investing and financing cash flows, as depicted in our statements of cash flows, and the trends underlying these changes. Finally, MD&A provides information on market risk exposures and certain legal matters. Executive Summary Our net sales in 2004 increased to $5,624 million from $3,476 million in 2003, an increase of 62 percent. Excluding the favorable impact of $155 million of foreign currency fluctuations, our net sales increased 57 percent. Our gross profit increased to $4,332 million, or 77.0 percent of net sales, in 2004 from $2,515 million, or 72.4 percent of net sales, in 2003. Our reported net income for 2004 was $1,062 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, as compared to $472 million, or $0.56 per diluted share, in 2003. Our reported results included net after-tax charges of $332 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in 2004 as compared to net after-tax charges of $49 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in 2003.1 In addition, our cash provided by operating activities was $1,804 million in 2004 as compared to $787 million in 2003. This growth in 2004 resulted largely from sales of our TAXUS® Express2™ paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system that we launched in the United States (U.S.) in March 2004 and in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets during the first quarter of 2003. TAXUS stent sales in 2004 were $2,143 million, or 38 percent of our net sales, as compared to $198 million, or 6 percent of our net sales, in 2003. We have achieved leading drug-eluting stent market share positions within our U.S., Europe and Inter-Continental markets. We have not yet launched a drug-eluting stent system within our Japan market. In the U.S., physicians have rapidly adopted drug-eluting stent technology. As of December 31, 2004, we estimate that physicians in the U.S. have converted approximately 85 percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare-metal stents to drug-eluting stents. In our Europe and Inter-Continental markets, conversion rates have been more gradual primarily due to the timing of local reimbursement and funding levels. As of December 31, 2004, we estimate that physicians in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets have converted approximately 40 percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare-metal stents to drug-eluting stents. We continue to expect year-to-year growth in our drug-eluting stent sales in 2005 as a result of a full year of sales in the U.S. and increased adoption rates in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets. Further, our drug-eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug-eluting products in the U.S. market and there is uncertainty regarding the timing of new entrants into that market. During 2004, we partially invested our increased gross profit in various research and development initiatives, particularly related to our coronary stent franchise; we funded additional headcount and programs to strengthen our sales and marketing organization; and we made enhancements to our manufacturing and distribution network. In 2005, we will continue to invest aggressively to sustain our leadership in drug-eluting stent technology and to expand our new product offerings through internal development, acquisitions and strategic alliances. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow during 2004, which increased over $1 billion as compared to 2003. In addition, due to favorable market conditions, we raised $1.1 billion from the public markets through two bond offerings during 2004. We used cash generated from operating activities and from the public debt issuances to repay short-term debt obligations, to repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market and to fund 2004 strategic alliances and acquisitions, including our $740 million acquisition of Advanced Bionics Corporation (Advanced Bionics). The acquisition of Advanced Bionics expands our technology portfolio into the implantable microelectronic device market that physicians use to treat numerous neurological disorders. 1 The 2004 net after-tax charges consisted of a $75 million provision for legal and regulatory exposures; a $71 million enhancement to our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (401(k) Plan); $65 million of purchased research and development; a $61 million charge relating to taxes on the approximately $1 billion of cash that we plan to repatriate in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004; and a $60 million non-cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. The 2003 net after-tax charges consisted of $37 million of purchased research and development and $12 million in charges related to litigation and product liability settlements. 20 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Sales The following table provides our net sales by region and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis: 2004 versus 2003 2003 versus 2002 As As Reported Constant Reported Constant Currency Currency Currency Currency (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Basis Basis Basis Basis United States $ 3,502 $ 1,924 $ 1,756 82 % 82 % 10 % 10 % Europe $ 994 $ 672 $ 456 48 % 35 % 47 % 26 % Japan 613 541 494 13 % 6 % 10 % 2 % Inter-Continental 515 339 213 52 % 44 % 59 % 48 % International $ 2,122 $ 1,552 $ 1,163 37 % 27 % 33 % 20 % Worldwide $ 5,624 $ 3,476 $ 2,919 62 % 57 % 19 % 14 % The following table provides our worldwide net sales by division and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis: 2004 versus 2003 2003 versus 2002 As Reported Constant As Reported Constant Currency Currency Currency Currency (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Basis Basis Basis Basis Cardiovascular $ 4,107 $ 2,168 $ 1,797 89 % 84 % 21 % 15 % Electrophysiology 130 113 101 15 % 12 % 12 % 8 % Neurovascular 253 223 169 13 % 9 % 32 % 23 % Cardiovascular $ 4,490 $ 2,504 $ 2,067 79 % 74 % 21 % 15 % Oncology $ 186 $ 166 $ 143 12 % 8 % 16 % 12 % Endoscopy 641 580 513 11 % 7 % 13 % 8 % Urology 261 226 196 15 % 13 % 15 % 13 % Endosurgery $ 1,088 $ 972 $ 852 12 % 9 % 14 % 10 % Neuromodulation $ 46 N/A N/A N/A N/A Worldwide $ 5,624 $ 3,476 $ 2,919 62 % 57 % 19 % 14 % We manage our international operating regions and divisions on a constant currency basis, while market risk from currency exchange rate changes is managed at the corporate level. U.S. Net Sales In 2004, our U.S. net sales increased by $1,578 million, or 82 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to $1,570 million in sales of our TAXUS stent system. We launched the TAXUS stent system in the U.S. late in the first quarter of 2004. Declines in our bare-metal stent revenue by $155 million to $59 million in 2004 partially offset this increase as physicians continued to convert the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare-metal stents to drug-eluting stents, including our TAXUS stent system. Sales from other products within our Cardiovascular division also increased by $49 million, or 5 percent, during 2004. The remainder of the increase in our U.S. revenues related to sales growth in each of our other U.S. divisions, including $37 million in sales from our Neuromodulation division. We established this division following our June 2004 acquisition of Advanced Bionics. 21 Table of Contents In 2003, our U.S. net sales increased by $168 million, or 10 percent, as compared to 2002. The increase related primarily to sales growth in our Cardiovascular division. Our coronary stent revenues in the U.S. increased in 2003 by $35 million, or 19 percent, due to sales of the Express2TM coronary stent system that we launched in September 2002. Sales from our other Cardiovascular products, including the Maverick® coronary angioplasty balloon catheters and the FilterWire EX™ embolic protection device, also increased by $50 million, or 6 percent, as compared to 2002. The remainder of the increase in our U.S. revenues related to sales growth in each of our other U.S. divisions. International Net Sales In 2004, our international net sales increased by $570 million, or 37 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to sales growth of our TAXUS stent system by $375 million, or 189 percent, in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets. We launched the TAXUS stent system in these markets during the first quarter of 2003. The remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to incremental growth in various product franchises, none of which was individually significant. In 2004, our Japan net sales increased by $72 million, or 13 percent, as compared to 2003 primarily due to $57 million in sales of our Express2 coronary stent system. We launched the Express2 coronary stent system in Japan during the first quarter of 2004. During the second quarter of 2004, one of our competitors launched its drug-eluting stent in Japan. As a result, we experienced declining coronary stent sales in Japan throughout the second half of 2004. Until we launch our drug-eluting stent in Japan, which we expect to occur late in 2006, we do not expect significant sales of our coronary stents in Japan. In 2003, our international net sales increased by $389 million, or 33 percent, as compared to 2002. The increase related primarily to $198 million in sales of our TAXUS stent system in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets. The remainder of the increase in our net sales in these markets was due to incremental growth in various product franchises, including our ultrasound product line as well as peripheral vascular stents and balloons. Gross Profit The following table provides a summary of our gross profit: 2004 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net % of Net (in millions) $ Sales $ Sales $ Sales Gross profit 4,332 77.0 2,515 72.4 2,049 70.2 In 2004, our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 4.6 percentage points as compared to 2003. Shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products, primarily drug-eluting coronary stent systems in the U.S., increased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 6.5 percentage points. This improvement in our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially reduced by 1.0 percentage point related to $57 million in inventory write-downs, with $43 million of that amount attributable to our recalls of certain coronary stent systems and $14 million attributable to the write-down of TAXUS stent inventory due to shelf-life dating. In addition, other expenses primarily associated with increased investments in our manufacturing capabilities reduced gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2004 by approximately 1.0 percentage point. We anticipate that our gross profit will continue to increase during 2005 due to expected sales growth of higher margin products, including our TAXUS stent system. In 2003, our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 2.2 percentage points as compared to 2002. Cost reductions resulting from prior year initiatives that related to plant network optimization, manufacturing process control and supply chain optimization increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 3.0 percentage points. In addition, shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products, primarily coronary stents, increased gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 1.3 percentage points. These improvements in gross profit were partially reduced by increased period expenses, including start-up costs associated with TAXUS stent system production, which decreased gross profit as a percentage of our net sales by 1.0 percentage point. 22 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses: 2004 2003 2002 % of Net % of Net % of Net (in millions) $ Sales $ Sales $ Sales Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,742 31.0 1,171 33.7 1,002 34.3 Research and development expenses 569 10.1 452 13.0 343 11.8 Royalty expense 195 3.5 54 1.6 36 1.2 Amortization expense 112 2.0 89 2.6 72 2.5 Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses In 2004, our SG&A expenses increased by $571 million, or 49 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to approximately $200 million in additional marketing programs, increased headcount and higher sales force commission expenses, mainly attributable to our TAXUS stent program, and, to a lesser degree, to support our other product franchises; and $40 million due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, our SG&A expenses in 2004 included charges of $110 million attributable to an enhancement to our 401(k) Plan and $90 million resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. Further, our SG&A expenses included $40 million in operating expenses associated with our acquisition of Advanced Bionics. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 31.0 percent in 2004 from 33.7 percent in 2003 primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in 2004. We anticipate that SG&A expenses will continue to increase, but decrease as a percentage of net sales, excluding the impact of any future acquisitions, due to expected revenue growth and our plan to continue to grow SG&A spending at a slower rate than revenue. In 2003, our SG&A expenses increased by $169 million, or 17 percent, as compared to 2002. The increase related primarily to approximately $95 million in additional marketing programs, increased headcount and higher employee compensation, mainly attributable to our TAXUS stent program, and, to a lesser degree, to support our other product franchises; and $45 million due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 33.7 percent in 2003 from 34.3 percent in 2002 primarily due to our efforts to control general and administrative expenses. Research and Development Expenses Our investment in research and development reflects spending on regulatory compliance and clinical research as well as new product development programs. In 2004, our research and development expenses increased by $117 million, or 26 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to an increased investment of approximately $50 million in our Cardiovascular division, which was mainly associated with our next-generation stent platforms. In addition, our research and development expenses in 2004 included $25 million attributable to our acquisition of Advanced Bionics. The remainder of the growth in our research and development spending reflects investments to enhance our clinical and regulatory infrastructure and provide additional funding for research and development on next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses decreased to 10.1 percent in 2004 from 13.0 percent in 2003 primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in 2004. In 2005, we expect to continue to invest aggressively in research and development and we expect research and development spending to remain at approximately 10 percent of our net sales in 2005. In 2003, our research and development expenses increased by $109 million, or 32 percent, as compared to 2002. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses increased to 13.0 percent in 2003 from 11.8 percent in 2002. The increase related primarily to an increased investment of $55 million in our drug-eluting stent franchise. In addition, in 2003, we increased our investment in certain other Cardiovascular projects by $15 million and in Endosurgery projects by $25 million. Royalty Expense In 2004, our royalty expense increased by $141 million, or 261 percent, as compared to 2003. As a percentage of net sales, royalty expense increased to 3.5 percent in 2004 from 1.6 percent in 2003. The increase in our royalty expense related to sales growth of royalty-bearing products, primarily sales of our TAXUS stent system. Royalty expense attributable to sales of our TAXUS stent system increased by $137 million to $147 million for 2004 as compared to 2003. In November 2004, we exercised our right under an 23 Table of Contents existing licensing agreement with Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Angiotech) to obtain an exclusive license for the use of paclitaxel and other agents for certain applications in the coronary vascular field. In exchange for the exclusive license, we will pay Angiotech an additional royalty of one percentage point on certain future sales. We anticipate that royalty expense, as a percentage of our net sales, will increase to approximately 4 percent in 2005. In addition, we continue to enter strategic technological alliances, some of which include royalty commitments. In 2003, our royalty expense increased by $18 million, or 50 percent, as compared to 2002. As a percentage of our net sales, royalty expense increased to 1.6 percent in 2003 from 1.2 percent in 2002. The increase related to sales growth of our royalty-bearing products, including $10 million of royalty expense payable on sales of our TAXUS stent system. Amortization Expense In 2004, our amortization expense increased by $23 million, or 26 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to the amortization of intangible assets from the acquisitions in 2004 of Advanced Bionics and Precision Vascular Systems, Inc. (PVS). Amortization expense for these two acquisitions was $17 million in 2004. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense decreased to 2.0 percent in 2004 from 2.6 percent in 2003 primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in 2004. In 2003, our amortization expense increased by $17 million, or 24 percent, as compared to 2002. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense increased to 2.6 percent in 2003 from 2.5 percent in 2002. The increase related primarily to amortization of intangible assets we acquired during 2003 and 2002. Interest Expense And Other, Net Our interest expense increased to $64 million in 2004 from $46 million in 2003 and $43 million in 2002. The increase in 2004 related primarily to an increase in our average debt levels and in average market interest rates on our floating-rate borrowings. Our other, net reflected expense of $16 million in 2004 and expense of $8 million in 2003. In 2004, our other, net included realized gains of $36 million from sales of investments that were offset by asset write-downs of $58 million associated with certain investments in and loans to privately held companies. We do not believe that these write-downs of assets will have a material impact on our future operations. In addition, our other, net included interest income of $20 million in 2004 and $6 million in 2003. Our interest income increased in 2004 due to growth in our overseas cash balances and our increased investment in securities with longer maturity dates. Our other, net reflected expense of $18 million in 2002, which included a donation of $18 million to fund the Boston Scientific Foundation, a charitable organization dedicated to the advancement of healthcare and education. Tax Rate The following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Percentage Point Increase/(Decrease) 2004 2003 2002 2004 versus 2003 2003 versus 2002 Reported tax rate 28.9 % 26.6 % 32.1 % 2.3 (5.5 ) Impact of certain charges* 4.9 % 1.6 % 3.1 % 3.3 (1.5 ) * These charges are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. In 2004, the increase in our reported tax rate as compared to 2003 related primarily to the net impact of certain charges during 2004 that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These charges included a provision for an extraordinary dividend related to overseas cash balances we plan to repatriate in 2005 pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act; an accrual for our legal and regulatory exposures; an enhancement to our 401(k) Plan; purchased research and development; and a non-cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. In addition, our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by more revenue being generated from products manufactured in lower tax jurisdictions. Offsetting this favorable impact was our decision to repatriate cash from certain of our non-U.S. operations that did not qualify under the American Jobs Creation Act. In connection with this decision, we established a deferred tax liability of $86 million that we believe is adequate to cover the taxes related to this repatriation. 24 Table of Contents Management currently estimates that our 2005 effective tax rate, excluding certain charges, will be approximately 24 percent. However, geographic changes in the manufacture of our products or future business acquisitions may positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate. In 2003, the decrease in our reported tax rate as compared to 2002 related primarily to the decrease in our purchased research and development charges to $37 million in 2003 from $85 million in 2002, which were not deductible for tax purposes. In addition, during 2003, we settled several audits and reduced our previous estimate for accrued taxes by $139 million to reflect the resolution of these audits. Further, as we generated more revenue from products manufactured in lower tax jurisdictions, our overall effective tax rate was favorably impacted. Offsetting this favorable impact was our decision to repatriate cash from certain non-U.S. operations. We established a deferred tax liability of $180 million that we believe is adequate to cover the taxes related to this repatriation. Litigation-Related Charges and Credits In 2004, we recorded a $75 million provision for legal and regulatory exposures. In 2003, we agreed to settle a number of our outstanding product liability cases. The cost of settlement in excess of our available insurance limits was $8 million. In addition, during 2003, we recorded a $7 million charge related to an adverse judgment in a suit filed by the Federal Trade Commission. In 2002, we recorded a favorable settlement with Medtronic, Inc. (Medtronic) of $175 million related to Medtronic’s rapid exchange stent delivery systems and angioplasty dilatation balloon catheters. In addition, we recorded a net charge of $76 million for settlements related to our rapid exchange catheter technology. Purchased Research and Development In 2004, we recorded $65 million of purchased research and development. Our 2004 purchased research and development consisted primarily of $50 million relating to our June 2004 acquisition of Advanced Bionics and $14 million relating to our April 2004 acquisition of PVS. The most significant in-process projects acquired in connection with our 2004 acquisitions included Advanced Bionics’ bion® microstimulator and drug delivery pump, which collectively represented 77 percent of our 2004 acquired in-process projects’ value. The bion microstimulator is an implantable neurostimulation device designed to treat a variety of neurological conditions, including migraine headaches, urge incontinence, epilepsy and sleep apnea. The cost to complete the bion microstimulator is estimated to be between $35 million and $45 million. The Advanced Bionics drug delivery pump is an implanted programmable device designed to treat chronic pain. The cost to complete the drug delivery pump is estimated to be between $30 million and $40 million. As of the date we acquired Advanced Bionics, we expected the products to be commercially available on a worldwide basis within four years. In 2003, we recorded $37 million of purchased research and development. Our 2003 purchased research and development consisted of $9 million relating to our acquisition of InFlow Dynamics, Inc. (InFlow) and $28 million relating primarily to certain acquisitions we consummated in prior years. The in-process projects acquired in connection with our acquisition of InFlow were not significant to our consolidated results. The purchased research and development associated with the prior years’ acquisitions related primarily to our acquisition of Embolic Protection, Inc. (EPI) and resulted from consideration that was contingent at the date of acquisition, but earned during 2003. In 2002, we recorded $85 million of purchased research and development. Our 2002 purchased research and development related primarily to the acquisitions of Enteric Medical Technologies, Inc. (EMT) and Smart Therapeutics, Inc. (Smart). The most significant in-process projects acquired in connection with our 2002 acquisitions included EMT’s ENTERYX® Liquid Polymer Technology and Smart’s atherosclerosis stent, which collectively represented 82 percent of our 2002 acquired in-process projects’ value. ENTERYX is a patented liquid polymer for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms. During 2003, we completed the ENTERYX in-process project and received FDA approval for this technology. The total cost for us to complete the project was $6 million. The atherosclerosis stent is a self-expanding nitinol stent designed to treat narrowing of the arteries around the brain. We continue to pursue the development of Smart’s atherosclerosis stent and believe we have a reasonable chance of completing the project. We have spent $7 million on this project as of December 31, 2004 and estimate additional costs of $1 million to complete the project. These estimates approximate our estimates at the time of acquisition. 25 Table of Contents Outlook In 2004, we increased our net sales by 62 percent, our reported net income by 125 percent and our cash provided by operating activities by 129 percent. This growth was primarily due to sales of our TAXUS stent system that was approved for sale in the U.S. on March 4, 2004. We estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market will exceed $5 billion in 2005 and approximate $6 billion in 2006. Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. Drug-eluting stents are estimated to represent approximately 87 percent of the worldwide coronary stent market in 2005 and approximately 90 percent in 2006. Our drug-eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug-eluting products in the U.S. market and there is uncertainty regarding the timing of new entrants into that market. We believe that we can maintain our leadership position within the drug-eluting stent market for a variety of reasons, including: à the positive and consistent results of our TAXUS clinical trials; à the performance benefits of our current technology; à the strength of our pipeline of drug-eluting stent products and the planned launch sequence of these products; à our overall market leadership in interventional medicine and our sizeable interventional cardiology sales force; and à our significant investments in our sales, clinical, marketing and manufacturing capabilities. However, a material decline in our drug-eluting stent revenue would have a significant adverse impact on our future operating results. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug-eluting coronary stent market and our position within this market include: à unexpected variations in clinical results or product performance of our and our competition’s products; à the timing of new competitive launches; à the average selling prices of drug-eluting stent systems; à delayed or limited regulatory approvals and reimbursement policies; à litigation related to intellectual property; à continued physician confidence in our technology; à the average number of stents used per procedure; à expansion of indications for use; and à the international adoption rate of drug-eluting stent technology. We recently announced nine-month results from our TAXUS V clinical trial. TAXUS V expands on the TAXUS IV pivotal trial by studying a higher-risk patient population, including patients with small vessels, large vessels and long lesions requiring multiple overlapping stents. The overall TAXUS V study met its primary endpoint of safety and efficacy as well as all secondary endpoints. In addition, stent thrombosis rates were virtually identical between the TAXUS stent and bare-metal stents indicating comparable safety of drug-eluting stents and bare-metal stents. However, inconsistent clinical data from existing or future trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties may impact our position in and share of the drug-eluting stent market. Our drug-eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug-eluting products in the U.S. market. We expect our share of the drug-eluting stent market as well as unit prices to be adversely impacted as additional competitors enter the drug-eluting stent market, which we anticipate during 2005 internationally and during 2006 in the U.S. During the first quarter of 2005, we completed our initial launch of our next-generation drug-eluting stent product, the TAXUS Liberté™ coronary stent system, in certain Inter-Continental markets. We expect to launch the TAXUS Liberté coronary stent system in Europe during 2005 and in the U.S. during 2006, subject to regulatory approval. In 2004, Johnson & Johnson announced its intention to acquire Guidant Corporation (Guidant). Johnson & Johnson and Guidant are two of our primary competitors in the coronary stent market and this acquisition may create increased volatility and uncertainty within the coronary stent market. In addition, during the second quarter of 2004, one of our competitors launched its drug-eluting stent in Japan, which has converted rapidly to drug-eluting stent technology. In order to receive regulatory approval of the TAXUS stent system in Japan, we were required during 2004 to conduct a small clinical trial using the TAXUS stent system with the antiplatelet therapy Ticlid®. We currently expect to launch the TAXUS stent system in Japan late in 2006, subject to regulatory approval. Due to the timing of regulatory approval for our TAXUS stent system and recent government-mandated, industry-wide pricing reductions for medical devices in Japan, we believe that our operating income in Japan may be reduced by approximately $70 million in 2005 as compared to 2004. Until we launch our drug-eluting stent in Japan, it is likely that our Japan business will be subject to significant market share and price pressure. 26 Table of Contents There continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market. We are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings with our competitors, including Johnson & Johnson, Medtronic and Medinol Ltd. (Medinol). There can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings would not impact our ability to meet our objectives in the market. See the notes to our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report for a description of these legal proceedings. The manufacture of our TAXUS stent system involves the integration of multiple technologies, critical components, raw materials and complex processes. Inventory levels may be impacted by significant favorable or unfavorable changes in forecasted demand as well as disruptions associated with the TAXUS stent manufacturing process. Variability in expected demand or the timing of the launch of next-generation products may result in excess or expired inventory positions and future inventory charges. In July and August, we announced the voluntary recalls of approximately 88,000 TAXUS Express2 stent systems and 11,000 Express2 stent systems, due to characteristics in the delivery catheters that had the potential to impede balloon deflation during a coronary angioplasty procedure. As a result of our investigation made in conjunction with the recalls, we implemented reviews of our manufacturing process, additional inspections and an FDA-approved modification to the manufacturing process for these products. We believe that these measures have been and continue to be effective in reducing the occurrence of balloon non-deflation. In connection with the voluntary recalls described above, we recorded a sales return reserve of $35 million and an inventory write-down of $43 million. The sales return reserve was established for all customer-owned inventory that was subject to the recalls. We reversed the sales return reserve in the second half of 2004 upon the replacement of recalled units with new units to customers. The inventory write-down related to inventory on consignment (i.e., inventory we owned) and inventory on hand at our facilities that was subject to the recalls. We placed the recalled inventory into quarantine upon receipt and we will scrap it when permitted by the FDA. We do not intend to sell the quarantined inventory. In October 2004, the FDA indicated that it would seek no further regulatory action regarding the recalls. Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our acquisitions are intended to expand further our ability to offer our customers effective, quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. Management believes it has developed a sound plan to integrate these businesses. However, our failure to integrate these businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic and financial objectives of these transactions. In connection with these acquisitions and other strategic alliances, we have acquired numerous in-process research and development platforms. As we continue to undertake strategic initiatives, it is reasonable to assume that we will acquire additional in-process research and development platforms. In addition, we have entered a significant number of strategic alliances with privately held and publicly traded companies. Many of these alliances involve equity investments and often give us the option to acquire the other company in the future. We enter these strategic alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets. The success of these alliances is an important element of our growth strategy. However, the full benefit of these alliances is often dependent on the strength of the other companies’ underlying technology. The inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings, or litigation related to these technologies, among other factors, may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these alliances. We expect to continue to invest aggressively in our drug-eluting stent program to achieve sustained worldwide market leadership positions. Further, we anticipate increasing our focus and spending on internal research and development in areas outside of drug-eluting stent technology. We believe our focus will be primarily on endoscopic systems, carotid stenting, vascular sealing, endovascular aortic repair, cardiac rhythm management, bifurcation stenting and neuromodulation. In addition, we will continue to seek market opportunities and growth through investments in strategic alliances and acquisitions. Potential future acquisitions, including companies with whom we currently have strategic alliances or options to purchase, may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional financing, depending on their size and nature. International markets are also being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs. Our profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions, foreign currency fluctuations, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development, rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy. Any significant changes in the competitive, political, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our revenues and profits. 27 Table of Contents Further, the trend in countries around the world, including Japan, toward more stringent regulatory requirements for product clearance, changing reimbursement models and more vigorous enforcement activities has generally caused or may cause medical device manufacturers like us to experience more uncertainty, delay, greater risk and higher expenses. In addition, we are required to renew regulatory approvals in certain international jurisdictions, which may require additional testing and documentation. A decision not to dedicate sufficient resources, or the failure to timely renew these approvals, may limit our ability to market our full line of existing products within these jurisdictions. These factors may impact the rate at which we can grow. However, management believes that we are poised to take advantage of opportunities that exist in the markets we serve. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table provides a summary of key performance indicators that we use to assess our liquidity: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,296 $ 671 $ 260 Short-term marketable securities 344 81 17 Cash provided by operating activities 1,804 787 736 Cash used for investing activities 1,622 871 485 Cash provided by (used for) financing activities 439 487 (175 ) EBITDA* $ 1,813 $ 879 $ 748 * The following represents a reconciliation between EBITDA and net income: (in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Net income $ 1,062 $ 472 $ 373 Income taxes 432 171 176 Interest expense 64 46 43 Interest income (20 ) (6 ) (5 ) Depreciation and amortization 275 196 161 EBITDA $ 1,813 $ 879 $ 748 Management uses EBITDA to assess operating performance and believes that it may assist users of our financial statements in analyzing the underlying trends in our business over time. Users of our financial statements should consider this non-GAAP financial information in addition to, not as a substitute for, or as superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA included pre-tax charges of $340 million in 2004, $52 million in 2003 and $33 million in 2002.2 Operating Activities Cash generated by our operating activities continues to provide a major source of funds for investing in our growth. The increase in cash generated by our operating activities is primarily attributable to the increase in EBITDA offset by changes in our operating assets and liabilities and certain tax-related items. The increase in EBITDA was primarily due to 2004 sales of our TAXUS stent system. A 2 The 2004 pre-tax charges consisted of a provision for legal and regulatory exposures, an enhancement to our 401(k) Plan, purchased research and development and a non-cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. The 2003 pre-tax charges consisted of purchased research and development and charges related to litigation and product liability settlements. The 2002 pre-tax charges consisted of purchased research and development, costs related to our global operations strategy that was substantially completed in 2002, a charitable donation to fund the Boston Scientific Foundation and special credits for net amounts received in connection with litigation settlements. 28 Table of Contents portion of the cash generated from these sales was invested in research and development projects and in our sales, clinical and manufacturing capabilities. Significant cash flow effects from our operating assets and liabilities in 2004 included increases in cash flow of $364 million attributable to accounts payable and accrued expenses and $200 million attributable to taxes payable and other liabilities as well as decreases in cash flow of $317 million attributable to trade accounts receivable and $57 million attributable to inventories. The increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses related primarily to the enhancement we made to our 401(k) Plan in 2004; our provision for legal and regulatory exposures; royalty expense attributable to sales growth of royalty-bearing products; and an increase in employee-related accruals. A portion of these accounts payable and accrued expenses will be paid in the beginning of 2005. The increase in taxes payable and other liabilities related primarily to the increase in income taxes payable associated with our 2004 income growth. The increase in trade accounts receivable related primarily to our 2004 sales growth. The increase in inventories related primarily to our accumulation of inventory to fulfill worldwide demand for the TAXUS stent system. Investing Activities We made capital expenditures of $274 million in 2004 as compared to $187 million in 2003. The increase related primarily to our spending of $55 million during 2004 for the purchase and build out of an office complex for our Endosurgery division in the U.S. The remainder of the increase was attributable to our capital spending to enhance our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $400 million during 2005, which includes further investments in our manufacturing and distribution capabilities, as well as our facility network. In 2002, we began investing our excess cash in short-term marketable securities with maturity dates that exceeded 90 days in order to benefit from higher returns. In 2004, we purchased $660 million of these investments and we received $397 million from maturities of our short-term marketable securities. Our investing activities during 2004 also included $729 million of net payments attributable to our acquisition of Advanced Bionics; $75 million of net payments attributable to our acquisition of PVS; $107 million of acquisition-related payments associated with EPI, Smart and InFlow; and $272 million of payments related to our strategic alliances with both privately held and publicly traded companies. These payments were offset by $98 million of cash proceeds from sales of privately held and publicly traded equity securities. In March 2005, we acquired Advanced Stent Technologies, Inc. (AST), a developer of stent delivery systems that are designed to address coronary artery disease in bifurcated vessels. In conjunction with the acquisition of AST, we will pay approximately $120 million in shares of our common stock plus future consideration that is contingent upon AST achieving certain milestones. Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities reflect proceeds from long-term public debt issuances, repayment of short-term borrowings, payments for share repurchases and proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs. The following table provides a summary at December 31 of our net debt: (in millions) 2004 2003 Short-term debt $ 1,228 $ 553 Long-term debt 1,139 1,172 Gross debt $ 2,367 $ 1,725 Less: cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 1,640 752 Net debt $ 727 $ 973 We had outstanding borrowings of $2,367 million at December 31, 2004 at a weighted average interest rate of 3.38 percent as compared to outstanding borrowings of $1,725 million at December 31, 2003 at a weighted average interest rate of 1.96 percent. During 2004, we received net proceeds from borrowings of $577 million. We used proceeds from debt issuances principally to fund our acquisitions and other strategic alliances. Our cash and cash equivalents primarily relate to our non-U.S. operations. In October 2004, the U.S. enacted the American Jobs Creation Act. The American Jobs Creation Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income 29 Table of Contents earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. Although the deduction is subject to a number of limitations and uncertainty remains as to how to interpret certain provisions in the American Jobs Creation Act, we believe that we have made an informed decision on the impact of the American Jobs Creation Act on our repatriation plans. Based on that decision, we plan to repatriate $1,046 million in extraordinary dividends as defined in the American Jobs Creation Act during the first quarter of 2005 and accordingly have recorded a tax liability of $61 million as of December 31, 2004. In 2004, we repatriated earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries for which we had previously accrued tax liabilities. Our resulting tax liabilities associated with this repatriation were $33 million. In addition, we established deferred tax liabilities of $86 million for additional amounts we plan to repatriate from certain of our non-U.S. operations that did not qualify under the American Jobs Creation Act. The tax liability we accrued for earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to be remitted in the future is $233 million at December 31, 2004. Borrowings and Credit Arrangements Revolving Credit Facilities: As of December 31, 2003, our credit facilities totaled $1,220 million. During 2004, we refinanced and increased our credit facilities, which totaled $2,185 million as of December 31, 2004. Our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2004 consisted of a $1,624 million credit facility that terminates in May 2009; a $541 million credit facility that terminates in May 2005 and contains an option to convert into a one-year term loan maturing in May 2006; and a $20 million uncommitted credit facility that terminates in June 2005. Our use of the borrowings is unrestricted and the borrowings are unsecured. Our credit facilities provide us with borrowing capacity and support our commercial paper program. We had $280 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2004 at a weighted average interest rate of 2.44 percent and $1,003 million outstanding at December 31, 2003 at a weighted average interest rate of 1.20 percent. In addition, we had 45 billion Japanese yen (translated to $439 million) of credit facility borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.37 percent at December 31, 2004 as compared to no outstanding Japanese yen revolving credit facility borrowings at December 31, 2003. We have a revolving credit and security facility that is secured by our U.S. trade receivables and provides $400 million of borrowing capacity. During 2004, we increased the facility borrowing capacity from $200 million to $400 million and extended the maturity to August 2005. Borrowing availability under this facility changes based upon the amount of our eligible receivables, concentration of our eligible receivables and other factors. Certain significant changes in the quality of our receivables may require us to repay borrowings immediately under the facility. The credit agreement required us to create a wholly owned entity, which we consolidate. This entity purchases our U.S. trade accounts receivable and then borrows from two third-party financial institutions using these receivables as collateral. The receivables and related borrowings remain on our balance sheet because we have the right to prepay any borrowings outstanding and effectively retain control over the receivables. Accordingly, pledged receivables are included as trade accounts receivable net, while the corresponding borrowings are included as debt on our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit and security facility as compared to $194 million of outstanding borrowings at a weighted average interest rate of 1.44 percent at December 31, 2003. In addition, we had uncommitted credit facilities with two commercial Japanese banks that provide for borrowings and promissory notes discounting of up to 15 billion Japanese yen (translated to $145 million) at December 31, 2004 and up to 14.6 billion Japanese yen (translated to $136 million) at December 31, 2003. Approximately $128 million of notes receivable were discounted at an average interest rate of 0.75 percent at December 31, 2004 and $113 million were discounted at an average interest rate of 1.38 percent at December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2004, we intended to repay all of our short-term debt obligations within the next twelve-month period. As of December 31, 2003, we had the ability and intent to refinance a portion of our short-term debt on a long-term basis through our revolving credit facilities and expected that a minimum of $650 million of our short-term obligations, including $456 million of our commercial paper and $194 million of our revolving credit and security facility borrowings, would remain outstanding beyond a twelve-month period. Accordingly, at December 31, 2003, we classified $650 million of our short-term borrowings as long-term borrowings. Senior Notes: We had senior notes of $1,600 million outstanding at December 31, 2004 and $500 million outstanding at December 31, 2003. These senior notes are publicly registered securities. At December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, we had $500 million of senior notes outstanding that we will repay in March 2005 (March 2005 Notes) upon maturity. The March 2005 Notes bear a semi-annual coupon of 6.625 percent, are not redeemable before maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. 30 Table of Contents In June 2004, we issued $600 million of senior notes due June 2014 (June 2014 Notes) under a public registration statement previously filed with the SEC. The June 2014 Notes bear a semi-annual coupon of 5.45 percent, are redeemable before maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. In November 2004, we filed a public registration statement with the SEC for the issuance of up to $1,500 million in various debt and equity securities. Under this public registration statement, we issued $250 million of senior notes due January 2011 (January 2011 Notes) and $250 million of senior notes due January 2017 (January 2017 Notes). The January 2011 Notes bear a semi-annual coupon of 4.25 percent, are redeemable before maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. The January 2017 Notes bear a semi-annual coupon of 5.125 percent, are redeemable before maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. We entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps to hedge against changes in the fair value of all of our senior notes. We have recorded changes in the fair value of our senior notes since entering the interest rate swaps. We recorded interest payments or receipts under the interest rate swap agreements as interest expense. For our March 2005 interest rate swap, we pay interest at six-month LIBOR plus 4.1 percentage points, which approximated 6.9 percent at December 31, 2004 and 5.3 percent at December 31, 2003. For our June 2014 interest rate swap, we pay interest at six-month LIBOR, which approximated 2.8 percent at December 31, 2004. For our January 2011 interest rate swap, we pay interest at six-month LIBOR minus approximately 0.1 percentage point and for our January 2017 interest rate swap, we pay interest at six-month LIBOR plus approximately 0.17 percentage points. As of December 31, 2004, the carrying amount of our June 2014 Notes included $32 million of unrealized gains that we recorded as other long-term assets to recognize the fair value of the interest rate swap. The fair values of our other interest rate swaps were immaterial at December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003. Equity In 2004, we repurchased approximately 10 million of our own shares at an aggregate cost of $360 million. In addition, during 2004, our Board of Directors approved the repurchase of up to an additional 50 million shares of our common stock at prevailing market prices on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The new authorization is in addition to approximately 13 million shares remaining under our previous share repurchase authorizations. Our available cash and cash equivalents, future operating cash flow and credit facilities will fund our share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2004, we have repurchased approximately 107 million shares of our common stock under these authorizations and we have 9 million shares of our common stock in our treasury at year end. During the first quarter of 2005, we continued to repurchase shares of our common stock. We may repurchase additional shares throughout the remainder of 2005 depending on market conditions. Repurchased shares are available for reissuance under our equity incentive plans and for general corporate purposes, including strategic alliances and acquisitions. During 2004, we received $225 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the exercise patterns of employees. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments. See Notes D, F and G to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our business combinations, long-term debt and lease arrangements. 31 Table of Contents Payments Due by Period 1 Year 2-3 4-5 After 5 (in millions) or Less Years Years Years Total Debt* $ 1,228 $ 4 $ 3 $ 1,102 $ 2,337 Operating leases† 45 58 15 3 121 Purchase obligations†,†† 115 14 3 132 Minimum royalty obligations† 3 8 3 6 20 Total $ 1,391 $ 84 $ 24 $ 1,111 $ 2,610 * Debt as reported in our consolidated balance sheets includes the mark-to-market effect of our interest rate swaps. † In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these obligations are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. †† These obligations related primarily to inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. We accounted for all of our business combinations using the purchase method of accounting. We accounted for the business combinations completed before July 1, 2001 in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 16, Business Combinations. We accounted for the business combinations completed after June 30, 2001 in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 141, Business Combinations. Certain of our business combinations involve the payment of contingent consideration. For acquisitions completed before July 1, 2001, we allocate these payments, if made, to specific intangible asset categories, including purchased research and development, and assign the remainder to goodwill as if we had paid the consideration at the date of acquisition. For acquisitions completed after June 30, 2001, we allocate these payments, if made, to goodwill. Payment of the additional consideration is generally contingent upon the acquired companies’ reaching certain performance milestones, including attaining specified revenue levels, achieving product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals. In 2004, we recorded amounts for acquisition-related obligations primarily as an adjustment to goodwill. Of the amounts recorded for acquisition-related obligations in 2003, we recorded $24 million as an adjustment to purchased research and development, $9 million as an adjustment to other identifiable intangible asset categories, net of the related deferred tax liabilities, and we recorded the remainder as an adjustment to goodwill. Certain earn-out payments are based on multiples of the acquired company’s revenue during the earn-out period and, consequently, we cannot currently determine the total payments. However, we have developed an estimate of the maximum potential contingent consideration for each of our acquisitions with an outstanding earn-out obligation. At December 31, 2004, the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration (undiscounted) that we could be required to make associated with our business combinations is approximately $3.1 billion, some of which may be payable in our common stock. The milestones associated with the contingent consideration must be reached in certain future periods ranging from 2005 through 2013. The estimated cumulative specified revenue level associated with these maximum future contingent payments is approximately $7.0 billion. Since it is not possible to estimate when the acquired companies will reach their performance milestones or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues, the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above. Further, during 2005, we expect to exercise our options to purchase certain strategic alliances for approximately $300 million, some of which may be payable in our common stock. 32 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We describe these accounting polices in Note A of our consolidated financial statements. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. These estimates are considered critical (1) if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (2) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas that we consider to be critical: Revenue Recognition Our revenue primarily consists of the sale of single-use disposable medical devices. Revenue is considered to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. These criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor, unless a consignment arrangement exists. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, which indicates that the sale is complete. We generally allow our customers to return defective or damaged products for credit. Our estimate for sales returns is based upon contractual commitments and historical trends and is recorded as a reduction to revenue. We offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue, with the corresponding liability being classified as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information that can be used to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. Inventories We state inventories at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market. Our provisions for excess or expired inventory are primarily based on management’s estimates of forecasted net sales levels. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future. We record provisions for inventory located in our manufacturing and distribution facilities as cost of sales. Valuation of Business Combinations We record intangible assets acquired in a business combination under the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative purchase price allocations and alternative estimated useful lives could result in different intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods. The valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in-process projects. Our purchased research and development represents the value of in-process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We expense the value attributable to these projects in conjunction with the acquisition. If the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects. We use the income approach to establish the fair values of our purchased research and development. This approach establishes fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in-process projects’ stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of 33 Table of Contents the acquisition date, the costs already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets, the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology. We base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors. For the in-process projects we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, we used the following risk-adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows: in 2004, 18 percent to 27 percent; in 2003, 24 percent; and in 2002, 17 percent to 26 percent. We believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects. Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets We record intangible assets at historical cost. We amortize our intangible assets subject to amortization, including patents, licenses, developed technology and core technology, using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. We review these intangible assets at least annually to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life. We also review our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of our assets and comparing the calculated fair values to the related carrying values. We test goodwill during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the test, we calculate the fair value of the reporting units as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The selection and use of an appropriate discount rate requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates. We have not recorded impairment of goodwill in any of the years included in our consolidated statements of operations. Investments in Strategic Alliances As of December 31, 2004, we had investments in 58 strategic alliances totaling $529 million. As of December 31, 2003, we had investments in 61 strategic alliances totaling $558 million. These assets primarily represent investments in privately held and publicly traded equity securities. We account for investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock. We account for investments in companies over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method. Our determination of whether we have significant influence over an investment requires judgment. We regularly review our strategic alliance investments for impairment indicators. Examples of events or circumstances that may indicate that an investment is impaired include a significant deterioration in earnings performance; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of an investee; and a significant doubt about an investee’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we determine that impairment exists and it is other-than-temporary, we will reduce the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value and will recognize an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of operations. Our exposure to loss related to our strategic alliances is generally limited to our equity investments, notes receivable and intangible assets associated with these alliances. As of December 31, 2004, we held investments totaling $61 million in two companies that we accounted for under the equity method. Our ownership percentages in these companies range from approximately 25 percent to 30 percent. Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We recognized net deferred tax liabilities aggregating $18 million at December 31, 2004 and net deferred tax assets aggregating $94 million at December 31, 2003. The liabilities relate principally to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be remitted in the future. The assets relate principally to the establishment of inventory and product-related reserves, purchased research and development, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. In light of our historical financial performance, we believe these assets will be substantially recovered. See Note J of our consolidated financial statements for a detailed analysis of our deferred tax positions. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years. 34 Table of Contents We have provided for income taxes payable related to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that may be repatriated in the foreseeable future. Income taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where such earnings have been permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. It is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested are $1,005 million at December 31, 2004 and $1,184 million at December 31, 2003. In addition, we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and could be subject to audit in these jurisdictions. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and may cover multiple years. In management’s opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all years subject to audit. Stock Option Modifications During the fourth quarter, we modified certain of our stock option plans, principally for options granted prior to May 2001, to change the definition of retirement to conform to the definition generally used in our stock option plans subsequent to May 2001. As a result of these modifications, we recorded a $90 million charge ($60 million after-tax) in 2004. The key assumptions in estimating the charge were the anticipated retirement age and the expected exercise patterns for the individuals whose options were modified. If our assumptions do not approximate actual retirement behavior and exercise activity, we may need to record adjustments through our statements of operations. Legal Costs We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. We accrue costs of settlement, damages and, under certain conditions, costs of defense when such costs are probable and estimable. Otherwise, these costs are expensed as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Our accrual for regulatory and litigation-related costs that were probable and estimable was $99 million at December 31, 2004 and $16 million at December 31, 2003. See further discussion of our legal proceedings in Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” above. Product Liability Costs We are substantially self-insured with respect to general and product liability claims. In the normal course of business, product liability claims are asserted against us. We accrue anticipated costs of litigation and loss for product liability claims based on historical experience, or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. We record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. Our accrual for product liability claims was $13 million at December 31, 2004 and $15 million at December 31, 2003. Product liability claims against us will likely be asserted in the future related to events not known to management at the present time. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. However, based on product liability losses experienced in the past, our election to become substantially self-insured is not expected to have a material impact on our future operations. Management believes that our risk management practices, including limited insurance coverage, are reasonably adequate to protect us against anticipated general and product liability losses. However, unanticipated catastrophic losses could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. New Accounting Standard On December 16, 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Statement No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. In general, Statement No. 123(R) contains similar accounting concepts as those described in Statement No. 123. However, Statement No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. We expect to adopt Statement No. 123(R) when it becomes effective as of July 1, 2005. Statement No. 123(R) permits public companies to adopt the new requirements using one of two methods: 1. A “modified prospective” method in that compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of Statement No. 123(R) for all share-based payments granted after the effective date of Statement No. 123(R) and (b) based on the requirements of Statement No. 123 for all awards granted to employees before July 1, 2005 that remain unvested as of July 1, 2005. 35 Table of Contents 2. A “modified retrospective” method that includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under Statement No. 123 for purposes of pro forma disclosures either (a) for all prior periods presented or (b) for prior interim periods of the year of adoption. We are currently evaluating which method we will use to adopt the requirements of Statement No. 123(R). As permitted by Statement No. 123, we currently account for share-based payments to employees using Opinion No. 25’s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options, except as disclosed in Note M of our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, the adoption of Statement No. 123(R)’s fair value method will impact our statements of operations. The impact of adoption of Statement No. 123(R) cannot be quantified at this time because it will depend on the level of share-based payments granted in the future and the method used to value such awards. However, had we adopted Statement No. 123(R) in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement No. 123 as described in our disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in Note A to our consolidated financial statements. Statement No. 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under currently effective accounting literature. This requirement will reduce our net operating cash flows and increase our net financing cash flows in periods after our adoption of Statement No. 123(R). While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows we recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was $185 million in 2004, $154 million in 2003 and $28 million in 2002. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control system to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2004, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ James R. Tobin /s/ Lawrence C. Best President and Executive Vice President and Chief Executive Officer Chief Financial Officer Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Scientific Corporation We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Boston Scientific Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over 36 Table of Contents financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, management’s assessment that Boston Scientific Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2004 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated March 10, 2005, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts March 10, 2005 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flow are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter into any derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by monitoring outstanding positions. Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily foreign currency denominated borrowings) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the notional amount of $4,171 million at December 31, 2004 and $1,724 million at December 31, 2003. The increase is due to hedging forecasted increases in earnings and cash flows denominated primarily in Japanese yen and euro and to changes in our Japanese subsidiary structure. We recorded $70 million of other assets and $129 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments at December 31, 2004 as compared to $15 million of other assets and $84 million of other liabilities recorded at December 31, 2003. A 10 percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $163 million at December 31, 37 Table of Contents 2004 and by $105 million at December 31, 2003. A 10 percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $190 million at December 31, 2004 and by $128 million at December 31, 2003. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or cash flow. Our earnings and cash flow exposure to interest rate changes on U.S. dollar and Japanese yen denominated debt is partially offset by interest rate changes on U.S. dollar denominated cash investments. We use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt or fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. We had interest rate derivative instruments outstanding in the notional amount of $1,600 million at December 31, 2004 and $500 million at December 31, 2003. We recorded $32 million of other assets and $1 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments at December 31, 2004 as compared to an immaterial amount at December 31, 2003. A one percent increase in global interest rates would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $84 million at December 31, 2004 as compared to $7 million at December 31, 2003. A one percent decrease in global interest rates would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $92 million at December 31, 2004 as compared to $7 million at December 31, 2003. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying liability in Item 7 above. 38 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 19:41:59.414917
885725,BSX,BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORP,2006,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Boston Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties including interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions, vascular surgery, electrophysiology, neurovascular intervention, oncology, endoscopy, urology, gynecology and neuromodulation. Our mission is to improve the quality of patient care and the productivity of healthcare delivery through the development and advocacy of less-invasive medical devices and procedures. This mission is accomplished through the continuing refinement of existing products and procedures and the investigation and development of new technologies that can reduce risk, trauma, cost, procedure time and the need for aftercare. Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our management's discussion and analysis (MD&A) begins with an executive summary that outlines our financial highlights during 2005 and focuses on the impact of drug-eluting stents to our operations. In addition, our executive summary will discuss the significance of the proposed Guidant Corporation acquisition to our future growth. Following the executive summary is an examination of the material changes in our operating results for 2005 as compared to 2004 and our operating results for 2004 as compared to 2003. The operating results are supplemented by an in-depth look at the major issues we believe are most relevant to our current and future prospects, including the proposed acquisition of Guidant. The discussion then provides an examination of liquidity, focusing primarily on material changes in our operating, investing and financing cash flows, as depicted in our statements of cash flows, and the trends underlying these changes. In addition, we will highlight the impact of the potential Guidant acquisition on our future liquidity. Finally, the MD&A provides information on our critical accounting policies. Executive Summary Our net sales in 2005 increased to $6,283 million from $5,624 million in 2004, an increase of 12 percent. Excluding the favorable impact of $25 million of foreign currency fluctuations, our net sales increased 11 percent. Our gross profit increased to $4,897 million, or 77.9 percent of net sales, in 2005 from $4,332 million, or 77.0 percent of net sales, in 2004. Our reported net income for 2005 was $628 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, as compared to $1,062 million, or $1.24 per diluted share, in 2004. Our reported results included net after-tax charges of $894 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, in 2005 as compared to net after-tax charges of $332 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, in 2004.1 In addition, our cash provided by operating activities was $903 million in 2005, which includes $750 million paid for the Medinol settlement, as compared to $1,804 million in 2004. The growth in 2005 resulted largely from a full year of sales of our TAXUS® Express2™ paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system that we launched in the United States in March 2004 and increased sales of the TAXUS stent system in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets. TAXUS stent sales in 2005 were $2,556 million as compared $2,143 million in 2004, an increase of 19 percent. We have achieved and maintained leading drug-eluting stent market positions within our U.S., Europe 1The 2005 net after-tax charges consisted of a $598 million litigation settlement with Medinol Ltd.; $267 million in purchased research and development primarily attributable to our recent acquisitions; $24 million of asset write-downs and employee-related costs that resulted from certain business optimization initiatives; $11 million in expenses related to certain retirement benefits; and a $6 million tax adjustment associated with a technical correction made to the American Jobs Creation Act. The 2004 net after-tax charges consisted of a $75 million provision for legal and regulatory exposures; a $71 million enhancement to our 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan; $65 million of purchased research and development; a $61 million charge relating to taxes on the approximately $1 billion of cash that we repatriated in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004; and a $60 million non-cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. 35 and Inter-Continental markets. Further, due to increased penetration rates and the successful launch of our next-generation TAXUS® Liberté™ paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets, our international TAXUS stent system sales for 2005 increased by 38 percent as compared to 2004. This increase in sales was offset by decreased TAXUS stent system sales in the U.S. during the second half of 2005, as compared to the same period in the prior year largely due to a reduction in market share, as well as pricing pressure. During the first three quarters of 2005, we experienced sequential declines in our market share. In the fourth quarter of 2005, our market share stabilized and was relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We expect to launch our TAXUS Liberté stent system in the U.S. in the second half of 2006 and our TAXUS Express2 stent system in Japan in the first half of 2007, subject to regulatory approvals. In addition, during 2005, our worldwide Endosurgery group sales increased to $1,228 million from $1,088 million in 2004, an increase of 13 percent. Further, our Neuromodulation division, formed following the June 2004 acquisition of Advanced Bionics Corporation, generated $148 million in net sales during 2005 as compared to $46 million in 2004, which represents the period following the acquisition. During 2005, we invested a portion of our increased gross profit in various research and development initiatives, particularly related to our 2004 acquisition of Advanced Bionics and our 2005 acquisition of TriVascular, Inc., as well as on projects within our Endosurgery group, including our Endovations™ Endoscopy Suite. We funded additional headcount and programs to strengthen our sales and marketing organization and we made enhancements to our manufacturing and distribution network. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow during 2005. In addition, due to favorable market conditions, we raised $750 million from the public markets through a November 2005 debt offering. We used cash generated from operating activities and from the public debt issuance to: repay short-term debt obligations; repurchase shares of our common stock on the open market; and fund 2005 strategic alliances and acquisitions. Recent Developments On January 25, 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Guidant Corporation for an aggregate purchase price of $27 billion (net of proceeds from option exercises), which represents a combination of cash and stock worth $80 per share of Guidant common stock. We expect that this acquisition will enable us to become a major provider in the high-growth cardiac rhythm management business, significantly diversifying our revenue stream across multiple business segments and enhancing our overall competitive position. In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition of Guidant, Abbott Laboratories has agreed to acquire Guidant's vascular intervention and endovascular businesses and has agreed to share the drug-eluting stent technology it acquires from Guidant with us. This will enable us to access a second drug-eluting stent program that will complement our existing TAXUS stent program. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearances under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and the European Union merger control regulation, as well as approval of Boston Scientific and Guidant shareholders. Subject to these conditions, we currently expect the acquisition to occur during the week of April 3, 2006. On January 26, 2006, we received a corporate warning letter from the FDA notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three facilities and advising us that our corporate wide corrective action plan relating to three warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. As also stated in this FDA warning letter, the FDA will not grant our requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve pre-market approval applications for our class III devices to which the quality control or current good manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably related until the deficiencies described in the letter have been corrected. We intend to resolve the quality issues 36 cited by the FDA prior to the anticipated launch of our TAXUS Liberté stent system in the United States and therefore do not anticipate delays of this product. However, while we believe we can remediate these issues in an expeditious manner, there can be no assurances regarding the length of time it will take to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the FDA, and any such resolution may require the dedication of significant incremental internal and external resources. In addition, if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the FDA, the FDA may take further regulatory actions against us, including but not limited to seizing our product inventory, obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products or assessing civil monetary penalties.

The increase primarily related to $1,763 million in sales of our TAXUS stent system for 2005 as compared to $1,570 million for 2004. We launched our TAXUS stent system in the U.S. late in the first quarter of 2004 and estimate that physicians in the U.S. have converted approximately 88 percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare-metal stents to drug-eluting stents as of December 31, 2005, as compared to 85 percent at December 31, 2004. The remainder of the increase in our U.S. net sales related to sales growth of $83 million from our Endosurgery group and $75 million from our Neuromodulation division. This increase in sales was offset by decreased TAXUS stent system sales in the U.S. during the second half of 2005, as compared to the same period in the prior year largely due to a reduction in market share, as well as pricing pressure. During the first three quarters of 2005, we experienced sequential declines in our market share. In the fourth quarter of 2005, our market share stabilized and was relatively consistent with the prior quarter. In 2004, our U.S. net sales increased by $1,578 million, or 82 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to $1,570 million in sales of our TAXUS stent system. Declines in our bare-metal stent revenue by $155 million to $59 million in 2004 partially offset this increase, as physicians continued to convert the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare-metal stents to drug-eluting stents, including our TAXUS stent system. Sales from other products within our Cardiovascular division also increased by $49 million, or five percent, during 2004. The remainder of the increase in our U.S. revenues related to sales growth in each of our other U.S. divisions, including $37 million in sales from our Neuromodulation division. International Net Sales In 2005, our international net sales increased by $309 million, or 15 percent, as compared to 2004. The increase related primarily to sales growth of our TAXUS stent system by $220 million, or 38 percent, in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets. As of December 31, 2005, we estimate that physicians in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets have converted approximately 49 percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare-metal stents to drug-eluting stents, as compared to approximately 40 percent at the end of 2004. Conversion rates have been more gradual in these markets than in the U.S. primarily due to the timing of local reimbursement and funding levels. In addition, we successfully launched our TAXUS Liberté stent system in certain Inter-Continental markets during the first quarter of 2005 and in Europe during the third quarter of 2005. The remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to growth in various product franchises, including $57 million in incremental sales from our Endosurgery group, and $27 million in sales growth from our Neuromodulation division. In 2005, our Japan net sales decreased by $34 million, or six percent, as compared to 2004 primarily due to decreased sales from our Cardiovascular division. We have experienced declining coronary stent sales in Japan since a competitor launched its drug-eluting stent in this market late in the second quarter of 2004. Due to the timing of regulatory approval for our TAXUS stent system and government-mandated pricing reductions for other products, we do not expect revenue growth in our existing Japan business until we receive regulatory approval and launch our drug-eluting stent in Japan, which we expect to occur in the first half of 2007. In 2004, our international net sales increased by $570 million, or 37 percent, as compared to 2003. Excluding the favorable impact of $155 million of foreign currency fluctuations, international net sales increased 27 percent. The increase related primarily to sales growth of our TAXUS stent system by $375 million, or 189 percent, in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets. We launched the TAXUS stent system in these markets during the first quarter of 2003. In addition, in 2004 our Japan net sales increased by $72 million, or 13 percent, as compared to 2003 primarily due to sales of our Express2 38 stent system, which we launched in Japan during the first quarter of 2004. The remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to incremental growth in various product franchises, none of which were individually significant. Gross Profit The following table provides a summary of our gross profit: 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales Gross profit 4,897 77.9 4,332 77.0 2,515 72.4 In 2005, our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 0.9 percentage points as compared to 2004. Shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products, primarily drug-eluting coronary stent systems, increased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.6 percentage points. Our gross profit percentage increased by 1.0 percentage point related to $57 million in inventory write-downs in 2004, including a $43 million write-down attributable to our recalls of certain coronary stent systems and a $14 million write-down of TAXUS stent inventory due to shelf-life dating. Our gross profit for 2005 was reduced as a percentage of net sales by 0.9 percentage points related to period expenses, including manufacturing start-up costs primarily associated with our TAXUS Liberté stent system and increased investment in quality initiatives. The remaining fluctuation in gross profit as a percentage of net sales primarily related to the favorable impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. In 2004, our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 4.6 percentage points as compared to 2003. Shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products, primarily drug-eluting coronary stent systems in the U.S., increased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 6.5 percentage points. This improvement in our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was partially reduced by 1.0 percentage point related to $57 million in inventory write-downs. In addition, other expenses primarily associated with increased investments in our manufacturing capabilities reduced gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2004 by approximately 1.0 percentage point. Operating Expenses The following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses: 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,814 28.9 1,742 31.0 1,171 33.7 Research and development expenses 680 10.8 569 10.1 452 13.0 Royalty expense 227 3.6 195 3.5 54 1.6 Amortization expense 152 2.4 112 2.0 89 2.6 Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses In 2005, our SG&A expenses increased by $72 million, or four percent, as compared to 2004. The increase primarily related to: approximately $100 million in increased headcount and higher compensation expense mainly attributable to the expansion of the sales force within our Interventional Cardiology business unit and Endosurgery group and costs related to market development initiatives; $75 million in incremental operating expenses associated with our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions, primarily 39 Advanced Bionics; $21 million in employee-related costs primarily attributable to optimization initiatives within our human resources function and international divisions; $19 million in stock compensation expense primarily associated with the issuance of deferred stock units in 2005; and $17 million in costs related to certain retirement benefits. Certain charges incurred in 2004 partially offset these increases, including a $110 million enhancement to our 401(k) Plan, and a $90 million non-cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 28.9 percent in 2005 from 31.0 percent in 2004 primarily due to the increase in our net sales in 2005. In 2004, our SG&A expenses increased by $571 million, or 49 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase primarily related to: approximately $200 million in additional marketing programs, increased headcount and higher sales force commission expenses, mainly attributable to our TAXUS stent program and, to a lesser degree, to support our other product franchises; and approximately $40 million due to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. In addition, our SG&A expenses in 2004 included charges of $110 million attributable to an enhancement to our 401(k) Plan and $90 million resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. Further, our SG&A expenses included $40 million in operating expenses associated with our acquisition of Advanced Bionics. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 31.0 percent in 2004 from 33.7 percent in 2003 primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in 2004. Research and Development Expenses Our investment in research and development reflects spending on regulatory compliance and clinical research as well as new product development programs. In 2005, our research and development expenses increased by $111 million, or 20 percent, as compared to 2004. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses increased to 10.8 percent in 2005 from 10.1 percent in 2004. The increase primarily related to approximately $60 million in incremental research and development expenses attributable to our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions, primarily Advanced Bionics and TriVascular. In addition, we increased spending on internal research and development projects within our Endosurgery group by $25 million, including increased spending on our Endovations Endoscopy Suite. In 2004, our research and development expenses increased by $117 million, or 26 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to an increased investment of approximately $50 million in our Cardiovascular division, which was mainly associated with our next-generation stent platforms. In addition, our research and development expenses in 2004 included $25 million attributable to our acquisition of Advanced Bionics. The remainder of the growth in our research and development spending reflects investments to enhance our clinical and regulatory infrastructure and provide additional funding for research and development on next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. As a percentage of our net sales, research and development expenses decreased to 10.1 percent in 2004 from 13.0 percent in 2003 primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in 2004. Royalty Expense In 2005, our royalty expense increased by $32 million, or 16 percent, as compared to 2004. As a percentage of net sales, royalty expense increased to 3.6 percent in 2005 from 3.5 percent in 2004. The increase in our royalty expense related to sales growth of royalty-bearing products, primarily sales of our TAXUS stent system. Royalty expense attributable to sales of our TAXUS stent system increased by $27 million to $174 million for 2005 as compared to 2004. In 2004, our royalty expense increased by $141 million, or 261 percent, as compared to 2003. As a percentage of net sales, royalty expense increased to 3.5 percent in 2004 from 1.6 percent in 2003. The increase in our royalty expense related to sales growth of royalty-bearing products, primarily sales of 40 our TAXUS stent system. Royalty expense attributable to sales of our TAXUS stent system increased by $137 million to $147 million for 2004 as compared to 2003. In November 2004, we exercised our right under an existing licensing agreement with Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to obtain an exclusive license for the use of paclitaxel and other agents for certain applications in the coronary vascular field. Amortization Expense In 2005, our amortization expense increased by $40 million, or 36 percent, as compared to 2004. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense increased to 2.4 percent in 2005 from 2.0 percent in 2004. The increase in our amortization expense was primarily due to $25 million in incremental amortization expense from the intangible assets obtained in conjunction with our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions, primarily Advanced Bionics. In addition, our amortization expense included a $10 million write-off of intangible assets related to our Enteryx® Liquid Polymer Technology (Enteryx), a discontinued technology platform obtained as a part of our acquisition of Enteric Medical Technologies, Inc. The write-off resulted from our decision during the third quarter of 2005 to cease selling the Enteryx product. In 2004, our amortization expense increased by $23 million, or 26 percent, as compared to 2003. The increase related primarily to the amortization of intangible assets from our acquisitions in 2004 of Advanced Bionics and Precision Vascular Systems, Inc. (PVS). Amortization expense for these two acquisitions was $17 million in 2004. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense decreased to 2.0 percent in 2004 from 2.6 percent in 2003 primarily due to the significant increase in our net sales in 2004. Interest Expense and Other, Net Our interest expense increased to $90 million in 2005 from $64 million in 2004 and $46 million in 2003. The increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 related primarily to an increase in average market interest rates on our borrowings. The increase in 2004 as compared to 2003 related primarily to an increase in our average debt levels and in average market rates on our floating-rate borrowings. Our other, net reflected income of $13 million in 2005, expense of $16 million in 2004, and expense of $8 million in 2003. Our other, net included asset write-downs of $17 million in 2005 and $58 million in 2004 associated with certain investments in and loans to privately held and publicly traded companies. We do not believe that these write-downs of assets will have a material impact on our future operations. In 2004, our other, net included realized gains of $36 million from sales of investments in privately held and publicly traded companies. In addition, our other, net included interest income of $36 million in 2005, $20 million in 2004, and $6 million in 2003. Our interest income increased in 2005 as compared to 2004 due to increases in average market interest rates. Our interest income in 2004 increased as compared to 2003 due primarily to growth in our cash balances. Tax Rate The following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Percentage Point Increase 2005 2004 2003 2005 versus 2004 2004 versus 2003 Reported tax rate 29.5 % 28.9 % 26.6 % 0.6 2.3 Impact of certain charges 5.5 % 4.9 % 1.6 % 0.6 3.3 In 2005, the increase in our reported tax rate as compared to 2004 related primarily to the impact of certain charges during 2005 that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These 41 charges include: certain litigation-related charges; purchased research and development; asset write-downs and employee-related costs that resulted from certain business optimization initiatives; costs related to certain retirement benefits; and a tax adjustment associated with a technical correction made to the American Jobs Creation Act. Management currently estimates that our 2006 effective tax rate, excluding certain charges, will be approximately 23 percent primarily due to our intention to reinvest substantially all of our offshore earnings. However, geographic changes in the manufacture of our products may positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate. In 2004, the increase in our reported tax rate as compared to 2003 related primarily to the net impact of certain charges during 2004 that were taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These charges included: a provision for an extraordinary dividend related to overseas cash balances we repatriated in 2005 pursuant to the American Jobs Creation Act; an accrual for our legal and regulatory exposures; an enhancement to our 401(k) Plan; purchased research and development; and a non-cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. In addition, our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by more revenue being generated from products manufactured in lower tax jurisdictions. Litigation-Related Charges and Credits In 2005, we recorded a $780 million pre-tax charge associated with the Medinol litigation settlement. On September 21, 2005, we reached a settlement with Medinol resolving certain contract and patent infringement litigation. In conjunction with the settlement agreement, we paid $750 million in cash and cancelled our equity investment in Medinol. In 2004, we recorded a $75 million provision for certain legal and regulatory matters, which included the civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, which was paid in the second quarter of 2005. In 2003, we agreed to settle a number of our outstanding product liability cases. The cost of settlement in excess of our available insurance limits was $8 million. In addition, during 2003, we recorded a $7 million charge related to an adverse judgment in a suit filed by the Federal Trade Commission. Purchased Research and Development In 2005, we recorded $276 million of purchased research and development. Our 2005 purchased research and development consisted of: $130 million relating to our acquisition of TriVascular; $73 million relating to our acquisition of Advanced Stent Technologies, Inc. (AST); $45 million relating to our acquisition of Rubicon Medical Corporation; and $3 million relating to our acquisition of CryoVascular Systems, Inc. In addition, we recorded $25 million of purchased research and development in conjunction with obtaining distribution rights for new brain monitoring technology that Aspect Medical Systems, one of our strategic partners, is currently developing. This technology is designed to aid the diagnosis and treatment of depression, Alzheimer's disease and other neurological conditions. The most significant 2005 purchased research and development projects included TriVascular's abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA) stent-graft and AST's Petal™ bifurcation stent, which collectively represented 73 percent of our 2005 purchased research and development. TriVascular's AAA stent-graft design reduces the size of the stent-graft by replacing much of the metal stent assembly with a polymer that is injected into channels within the stent-graft during the procedure. During the fourth quarter of 2005, management decided to re-design certain aspects of the stent graft to enhance patient safety and to improve product performance. The re-design will result in incremental costs and time to complete 42 the project relative to those expected at the date of acquisition. We currently expect to launch the AAA stent-graft in the U.S. by 2011 and to incur approximately $200 million of research and development costs over the next five years to complete the project. We continue to assess the pace of development and our opportunities within this market, which may result in a delay in the timing of regulatory approval. AST's Petal bifurcation stent is designed to expand into the side vessel when a single vessel branches into two vessels, permitting blood to flow into both branches of the bifurcation and providing support at the junction. We estimate the cost to complete the Petal bifurcation stent to be between $100 million and $125 million. As of the date we acquired AST, we expected the Petal bifurcation stent to be commercially available on a worldwide basis within six years in a drug-eluting configuration. In 2004, we recorded $65 million of purchased research and development. Our 2004 purchased research and development consisted primarily of $50 million relating to our acquisition of Advanced Bionics and $14 million relating to our acquisition of PVS. The most significant in-process projects acquired in connection with our 2004 acquisitions included Advanced Bionics' bion® microstimulator and drug delivery pump, which collectively represented 77 percent of our 2004 acquired in-process projects' value. The bion microstimulator is an implantable neurostimulation device designed to treat a variety of neurological conditions, including migraine headaches and urge incontinence. The cost to complete the bion microstimulator is estimated to be between $35 million and $45 million. We expect that the bion microstimulator will be commercially available within three years. The Advanced Bionics drug delivery pump is an implanted programmable device designed to treat chronic pain. The cost to complete the drug delivery pump is estimated to be between $30 million and $40 million. We continue to assess the pace of development and our opportunities for the drug delivery pump, which may result in a delay in the timing of regulatory approval. In 2003, we recorded $37 million of purchased research and development. Our 2003 purchased research and development consisted of $9 million relating to our acquisition of InFlow Dynamics, Inc. and $28 million relating primarily to certain acquisitions we consummated in prior years. The in-process projects acquired in connection with our acquisition of InFlow were not significant to our consolidated results. The purchased research and development associated with the prior years' acquisitions related primarily to our 2001 acquisition of Embolic Protection, Inc. and resulted from consideration that was contingent at the date of acquisition, but earned during 2003. In connection with our 2002 acquisitions, we acquired several in-process projects, including Smart Therapeutics, Inc.'s atherosclerosis stent. The atherosclerosis stent is a self-expanding nitinol stent designed to treat narrowing of the arteries around the brain. During 2005, we completed the atherosclerosis stent in-process project and received Humanitarian Device Exemption approval to begin selling this technology on a limited basis. The total cost for us to complete the project was approximately $10 million. In connection with our 2001 acquisitions, we acquired several significant in-process projects, including Interventional Technologies, Inc.'s next-generation Cutting Balloon® device. The Cutting Balloon device is a novel balloon angioplasty device with mounted scalpels that relieve stress in the artery, reducing the force necessary to expand the vessel. During 2005, we completed the Cutting Balloon in-process project and received FDA approval for this technology. The total cost for us to complete the project was approximately $7 million. 43 Outlook Coronary Stents Coronary stent revenue represented 43 percent of our consolidated net sales during 2005, and approximated $2,693 million in 2005 as compared to $2,351 million in 2004. We estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market will approximate $6 billion in 2006, as compared to $5.9 billion in 2005. Drug-eluting stents are estimated to represent approximately 87 percent of the dollar value of the worldwide coronary stent market in 2005 and 90 percent in 2006. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, we believe that the U.S. stent market has been substantially penetrated and estimate that physicians in the U.S. have converted approximately 88 percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare-metal stents to drug-eluting stents. We have experienced declines in our U.S. drug-eluting stent revenues in the second half of 2005 as compared to the same period in the prior year largely as a result of a reduction in market share, as well as pricing pressure. During the first three quarters of 2005, we experienced sequential declines in our market share. In the fourth quarter of 2005, our market share stabilized and was relatively consistent with the prior quarter. We expect to launch our TAXUS Liberté stent system in the U.S. during the second half of 2006, subject to regulatory approval. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, we estimate that physicians in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets have converted approximately 49 percent of the stents they use in interventional procedures from bare-metal stents to drug-eluting stents, as compared to approximately 40 percent at the end of 2004. We expect that conversion rates will continue to increase in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets. We successfully launched our TAXUS Liberté stent system in certain Inter-Continental markets during the first quarter of 2005 and in Europe during the third quarter of 2005. We believe our TAXUS Liberté stent system represents a driver of future revenue in these markets. Further, we expect to launch our TAXUS Express2 stent system in Japan during the first half of 2007, subject to regulatory approval, where we estimate the size of the market in 2007 to approximate $700 million. Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial endpoints. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market's perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our position in and share of the drug-eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market. We believe that we can maintain a leadership position within the drug-eluting stent markets in which we compete for a variety of reasons, including: •the positive and consistent results of our TAXUS clinical trials; •the performance benefits of our current technology; •the strength of our pipeline of drug-eluting stent products and the planned launch sequence of these products; •our overall market leadership in interventional medicine and our sizeable interventional cardiology sales force; and •our significant investments in our sales, clinical, marketing and manufacturing capabilities. A material decline in our drug-eluting stent revenue would have a significant adverse impact on our future operating results. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug-eluting coronary stent market and our position within this market include: •entry of additional competitors in international markets and the U.S.; 44 •declines in the average selling prices of drug-eluting stent systems; •variations in clinical results or product performance of our and our competitions' products; •new competitive product launches; •delayed or limited regulatory approvals and reimbursement policies; •litigation related to intellectual property; •continued physician confidence in our technology; •the average number of stents used per procedure; •expansion of indications for use; •a reduction in the overall number of procedures performed; •the international adoption rate of drug-eluting stent technology; and •the level of supply of our drug-eluting stent system and competitive stent systems. Our drug-eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug-eluting products in the U.S. market. Our share of the drug-eluting stent market, as well as unit prices, are expected to continue to be adversely impacted as additional significant competitors enter the drug-eluting stent market, which began during the third quarter of 2005 internationally and is expected to occur during the second half of 2007 in the U.S. The manufacture of our TAXUS stent system involves the integration of multiple technologies, critical components, raw materials and complex processes. Significant favorable or unfavorable changes in forecasted demand as well as disruptions associated with our TAXUS stent manufacturing process may impact our inventory levels. Variability in expected demand or the timing of the launch of next-generation products may result in excess or expired inventory positions and future inventory charges. Regulatory Compliance The trend in countries around the world, including the U.S. and Japan, toward more stringent regulatory requirements for product clearance, changing reimbursement models and more rigorous inspection and enforcement activities has generally caused or may cause medical device manufacturers like us to experience more uncertainty, delay, risk and expense. On January 26, 2006, we received a corporate warning letter from the FDA notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three facilities and advising us that our corporate wide corrective action plan relating to three warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. As also stated in this FDA warning letter, the FDA will not grant our requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve pre-market approval applications for our class III devices to which the quality control or current good manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably related until the deficiencies described in the letter have been corrected. We intend to resolve the quality issues cited by the FDA prior to the anticipated launch of our TAXUS Liberté stent system in the United States and therefore do not anticipate delays of this product. However, while we believe we can remediate these issues in an expeditious manner, there can be no assurances regarding the length of time it will take to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the FDA, and any such resolution will likely require the dedication of significant incremental internal and external resources. In addition, if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the FDA, the FDA may take further regulatory actions against us, including but not limited to seizing our product inventory, obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products or assessing civil monetary penalties. Intellectual Property Litigation There continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market and medical device industry. We are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings with our competitors, including Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, Inc. There can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings would not impact our ability to meet our 45 objectives in the market. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note J—Commitments and Contingencies to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of these legal proceedings. Innovation Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our research and development program is largely focused on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. We expect to continue to invest aggressively in our drug-eluting stent program to achieve sustained worldwide market leadership positions. We successfully launched our TAXUS Liberté stent system in certain Inter-Continental markets during the first quarter of 2005 and in Europe during the third quarter of 2005. We expect to launch our TAXUS Liberté stent system in the U.S. during the second half of 2006, subject to regulatory approval. Further, we anticipate continuing our increased focus and spending on areas outside of drug-eluting stent technology. We believe our focus will be primarily on technologies in which we have already made significant investments, including neuromodulation, endoscopic systems, carotid stenting, and bifurcation stenting, but may also extend into other medical device opportunities. However, given their early stage of development, there can be no assurance that these technologies will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of these technologies or our decision to reduce funding of these projects may adversely impact the contribution of these technologies to our future growth. Our acquisitions and alliances are intended to expand further our ability to offer our customers effective, quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. Management believes it has developed a sound plan to integrate acquired businesses. However, our failure to integrate these businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic and financial objectives of these transactions. Potential future acquisitions, including companies with whom we currently have strategic alliances or options to purchase, may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional financing, depending on their size and nature. Further, in connection with these acquisitions and other strategic alliances, we have acquired numerous in-process research and development projects. As we continue to undertake strategic initiatives, it is reasonable to assume that we will acquire additional in-process research and development projects. In addition, we have entered a significant number of strategic alliances with privately held and publicly traded companies. Many of these alliances involve equity investments and often give us the option to acquire the other company or assets of the other company in the future. We enter these strategic alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets. The success of these alliances is an important element of our growth strategy and we will continue to seek market opportunities and growth through investments in selective strategic alliances and acquisitions. However, the full benefit of these alliances is often dependent on the strength of the other companies' underlying technology and ability to execute. An inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings, or litigation related to these technologies, among other factors, may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these alliances. Our agreement to distribute certain guidewire and sheath products will expire during the first quarter of 2006. Management has identified some replacements for these products. The sales level associated with the replacement products is expected to be less than that of our previously distributed products. International Markets International markets are also being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs. Our profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions, foreign currency fluctuations, 46 regulatory and reimbursement approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development, rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy. Any significant changes in the competitive, political, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we are required to renew regulatory approvals in certain international jurisdictions, which may require additional testing and documentation. If sufficient resources are not available to renew these approvals or these approvals are not timely renewed, our ability to market our full line of existing products within these jurisdictions may be limited. Guidant Acquisition On January 25, 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Guidant Corporation for an aggregate purchase price of $27 billion (net of proceeds from option exercises), which represents a combination of cash and stock worth $80 per share of Guidant common stock. We expect that this acquisition will enable us to become a major provider in the high-growth cardiac rhythm management business, significantly diversifying our revenue stream across multiple business segments and enhancing our overall competitive position. In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition of Guidant, Abbott Laboratories has agreed to acquire Guidant's vascular intervention and endovascular businesses and has agreed to share the drug-eluting stent technology it acquires from Guidant with us. This will enable us to access a second drug-eluting stent program that will complement our existing TAXUS coronary stent program. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearances under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the European Union merger control regulation, as well as approval of Boston Scientific and Guidant shareholders. Subject to these conditions, we currently expect the acquisition to occur during the week of April 3, 2006. In connection with the acquisition, Boston Scientific will issue to Guidant shareholders and Abbott shares of Boston Scientific common stock. As a result of the issuance of these shares, current Boston Scientific stockholders will own a smaller percentage of Boston Scientific after the acquisition. We expect our weighted average shares outstanding, assuming dilution, to increase from approximately 840 million for 2005 to approximately 1.4 billion following the acquisition. The acquisition will also result in significant dilution to our 2006 earnings per share. The integration of Guidant's operations and product lines with Boston Scientific will be complex and time-consuming, and the separation of the Guidant businesses required by the Abbott transaction will add complexity to the transition process. The failure to integrate Boston Scientific and Guidant successfully and to manage the challenges presented by the transition process successfully, including the retention of key Guidant personnel, may result in the combined company and its stockholders not achieving the anticipated potential benefits of the acquisition. In addition, the combined company will incur integration and restructuring costs following the completion of the acquisition as Boston Scientific integrates certain operations of Guidant. Although Boston Scientific and Guidant expect that the realization of efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses may offset incremental transaction, merger-related and restructuring costs over time, no assurances can be made that this net benefit will be achieved in the near term, or at all. Completion of the acquisition is conditioned upon the receipt of certain governmental authorizations, consents, orders and approvals, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period, and any extension of the waiting period, under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and approval under the European Union merger control regulation. These consents, orders and approvals may impose conditions on, or require divestitures relating to, the divisions, operations or assets of Boston Scientific or Guidant, in addition to the purchase by Abbott of Guidant's vascular and endovascular businesses, and could require modification to the terms of the Abbott transaction agreement in a manner adverse to Boston Scientific or the combined company. These conditions or divestitures may jeopardize or delay completion of the Abbott 47 transaction or the acquisition or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the Abbott transaction or the acquisition. Further, no assurance can be given that the required consents and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied, and, if all required consents and approvals are obtained and the conditions are satisfied, no assurance can be given as to the terms, conditions and timing of the approvals or that they will satisfy the terms of the merger agreement. Additionally, completion of the acquisition is conditioned on the absence of certain restraining orders or injunctions by judgment, court order or law that would restrain or prohibit consummation of the acquisition. Boston Scientific and Guidant have received recent claims related to the acquisition from plaintiffs seeking an injunction to prohibit consummation of the acquisition and other relief, including monetary damages. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following table provides a summary of key performance indicators that we use to assess our liquidity and operating performance: (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Cash and cash equivalents $ 689 $ 1,296 $ 671 Short-term marketable securities 159 344 81 Cash provided by operating activities 903 1,804 787 Cash used for investing activities 551 1,622 871 Cash (used for) provided by financing activities (954 ) 439 487 EBITDA* 1,259 1,813 879 *The following represents a reconciliation between EBITDA and net income: (in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Net income $ 628 $ 1,062 $ 472 Income taxes 263 432 171 Interest expense 90 64 46 Interest income (36 ) (20 ) (6 ) Depreciation and amortization 314 275 196 EBITDA $ 1,259 $ 1,813 $ 879 Management uses EBITDA to assess operating performance and believes that it may assist users of our financial statements in analyzing the underlying trends in our business over time. Users of our financial statements should consider this non-GAAP financial information in addition to, not as a substitute for, or as superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA included pre-tax charges of $1,112 million in 2005, $340 million in 2004 and $52 million in 2003.2 2The 2005 pre-tax charges consisted of a litigation settlement with Medinol; purchased research and development; costs that resulted from certain business optimization initiatives; and expenses related to certain retirement benefits. The 2004 pre-tax charges consisted of a provision for certain legal and regulatory matters, which included a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, an enhancement to our 401(k) Plan, purchased research and development and a non-cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. The 2003 pre-tax charges consisted of purchased research and development and charges related to litigation and product liability settlements. 48 Operating Activities Cash generated by our operating activities continues to provide a major source of funds for investing in our growth. The decrease in cash generated by our operating activities in 2005 as compared to 2004 is primarily attributable to the decrease in EBITDA and by changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in EBITDA in 2005 as compared to 2004 reflects our third quarter 2005 settlement with Medinol, which was partially offset by increased sales of our TAXUS stent system during 2005. We invested a portion of the cash from sales of our TAXUS stent system in our sales, clinical and manufacturing capabilities, and in research and development projects. Significant cash flow effects from our operating assets and liabilities in 2005 included decreases in cash flow of: $162 million attributable to accounts payable and accrued expenses; $77 million attributable to inventories; $59 million attributable to prepaid expenses and other assets; and $45 million attributable to taxes payable and other liabilities. The decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2005 as compared to 2004 related to our $75 million provision for certain legal and regulatory matters, which included a civil settlement with the Department of Justice, and our one-time $110 million 401(k) contribution, which were both paid during June 2005. The increase in inventories in 2005 as compared to 2004 related primarily to the accumulation of inventory to fulfill worldwide demand for our TAXUS stent system and our Neuromodulation products. The increase in prepaid expenses and other assets in 2005 as compared to 2004 was attributable to the establishment of a tax-related receivable. The decrease in taxes payable and other liabilities in 2005 as compared to 2004 primarily related to $350 million in tax payments made during 2005 including those associated with cash repatriated under the American Jobs Creation Act and to the expected tax benefit associated with the settlement agreement with Medinol. The decrease in taxes payable in 2005 as compared to 2004 was partially offset by the increase in taxes payable associated with our 2005 earnings. Investing Activities We made capital expenditures of $341 million in 2005 as compared to $274 million in 2004. The increase primarily related to capital spending to enhance our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $400 million during 2006 (excluding Guidant), which includes additional capital expenditures to allow further growth in our Endosurgery group and Neuromodulation division, and certain business optimization initiatives in our human resources function, primarily outsourcing costs. Our investing activities during 2005 also included: $178 million of net payments primarily attributable to our acquisitions of Rubicon, TriVascular and CryoVascular; $33 million of acquisition earn-out payments primarily associated with prior acquisitions; and $208 million of payments related to our strategic alliances with both privately held and publicly traded companies. Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities reflect proceeds from long-term public debt issuances; repayment of short-term borrowings; payments for share repurchases; and proceeds from option exercises related to our equity incentive programs. 49 The following table provides a summary at December 31 of our net debt: (in millions) 2005 2004 Short-term debt $ 156 $ 1,228 Long-term debt 1,864 1,139 Gross debt $ 2,020 $ 2,367 Less: cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 848 1,640 Net debt $ 1,172 $ 727 We had outstanding borrowings of $2,020 million at December 31, 2005 at a weighted average interest rate of 4.80 percent as compared to outstanding borrowings of $2,367 million at December 31, 2004 at a weighted average interest rate of 3.38 percent. During 2005, we made net payments on borrowings of $313 million. Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily held by our non-U.S. operations. In 2005, we repatriated approximately $1,046 million in extraordinary dividends as defined in the American Jobs Creation Act from our non-U.S. operations. The American Jobs Creation Act created a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. As of December 31, 2004, we had recorded a tax liability of $61 million for the amounts we intended to repatriate in 2005 under the American Jobs Creation Act. In 2005, we repatriated earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries that did not qualify under the American Jobs Creation Act. The resulting tax liabilities associated with this repatriation were $127 million. In addition, during 2005, we made a decision to repatriate additional amounts from certain of our non-U.S. operations. In connection with this decision, we established a deferred tax liability of $27 million that we believe is adequate to cover the taxes related to this repatriation. Borrowings and Credit Arrangements Revolving Credit Facilities During 2005, we refinanced our revolving credit facilities to extend the maturity of one credit facility and to reduce borrowing capacity by $165 million. At December 31, 2005, our revolving credit facilities totaled approximately $2,020 million, as compared to $2,185 million at December 31, 2004. Our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2005 consisted of a $1,500 million credit facility that terminates in May 2009; a $500 million credit facility that terminates in May 2010 and contains an option to increase the facility size by an additional $500 million in the future; and a $20 million uncommitted credit facility that terminates in May 2006. Our use of the borrowings is unrestricted and the borrowings are unsecured. Our credit facilities provide us with borrowing capacity and support our commercial paper program. We had $149 million of commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2005 at a weighted average interest rate of 4.11 percent and $280 million outstanding at December 31, 2004 at a weighted average interest rate of 2.44 percent. In September 2005, we repaid 45 billion Japanese yen (approximately $400 million) in credit facility borrowings outstanding at a weighted average interest rate of 0.37 percent. During 2005, we decreased our credit and security facility that is secured by our U.S. trade receivables from $400 million to $100 million, effective April 30, 2005. During the first quarter of 2006, we expect to increase this facility from $100 million to $350 million. The credit and security facility terminates in August 2006. Borrowing availability under this facility changes based upon the amount of eligible receivables, concentration of eligible receivables and other factors. Certain significant changes 50 in the quality of our receivables may require us to repay borrowings immediately under the facility. The credit agreement required us to create a wholly-owned entity, which is consolidated. This entity purchases our U.S. trade accounts receivable and then borrows from two third-party financial institutions using these receivables as collateral. The receivables and related borrowings remain on the balance sheet because we have the right to prepay any borrowings outstanding and effectively retain control over the receivables. Accordingly, pledged receivables are included as trade accounts receivable, net, while the corresponding borrowings are included as debt on the consolidated balance sheets. There were no outstanding borrowings under the revolving credit and security facility as of December 31, 2005 or December 31, 2004. In addition, we have uncommitted credit facilities with two commercial Japanese banks that provide for borrowings and promissory notes discounting of up to 15 billion Japanese yen (translated to $127 million at December 31, 2005 and $145 million at December 31, 2004). Approximately $109 million of notes receivable were discounted at an average interest rate of 0.75 percent at December 31, 2005 and $128 million of notes receivable were discounted at an average interest rate of 0.75 percent at December 31, 2004. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, we intended to repay all of our short-term debt obligations within the next twelve-month period. Senior Notes We had senior notes of $1,850 million outstanding at December 31, 2005 and $1,600 million outstanding at December 31, 2004. •In November 2005, we issued $400 million of senior notes due November 2015 (November 2015 Notes) and $350 million of senior notes due November 2035 (November 2035 Notes) under a $1,500 million shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in November 2004. The November 2015 Notes bear a semi-annual coupon of 5.50 percent, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. The November 2035 Notes bear a semi-annual coupon of 6.25 percent, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. These are publicly registered securities. In December 2005, we announced our intent to supplement the terms of our November 2015 Notes and November 2035 Notes to provide for a potential interest rate adjustment accruing from November 17, 2005 on each series of these senior notes in the event that our credit ratings are downgraded as a result of the closing of our proposed acquisition of Guidant. The interest rate on these senior notes will be subject to a one-time increase based on our initial credit ratings. Based on preliminary indications from the rating agencies, we expect that the interest rate on each of our November 2015 Notes and our November 2035 Notes may increase by 0.75 percent. We will be unable to determine the actual increase, if any, of the interest rate on each of the November 2015 Notes and November 2035 Notes until after the closing of our proposed acquisition of Guidant. Any subsequent rating improvements will result in a decrease in the adjusted interest rate. The interest rate on the date these senior notes were originally issued will be permanently reinstated if and when the lowest credit ratings assigned to these senior notes is either A- or A3 or higher. •In March 2005, we repaid $500 million of senior notes that were outstanding at December 31, 2004. The notes bore a semi-annual coupon of 6.625 percent, were not redeemable prior to maturity and were not subject to any sinking fund requirements. •In November 2004, we issued $250 million of senior notes due January 2011 (January 2011 Notes) and $250 million of senior notes due January 2017 (January 2017 Notes) under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC in November 2004. The January 2011 Notes bear a semi-annual coupon of 4.25 percent, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any 51 sinking fund requirements. The January 2017 Notes bear a semi-annual coupon of 5.125 percent, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. These senior notes are publicly registered securities. We entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps indexed to six-month LIBOR, which approximated 4.70 percent at December 31, 2005 and 2.78 percent at December 31, 2004, to hedge against changes in the fair value of these senior notes. •In June 2004, we issued $600 million of senior notes due June 2014 (June 2014 Notes) under a shelf registration statement filed with the SEC. The June 2014 Notes bear a semi-annual coupon of 5.45 percent, are redeemable prior to maturity and are not subject to any sinking fund requirements. These senior notes are publicly registered securities. We entered into fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps indexed to six-month LIBOR, which approximated 4.70 percent at December 31, 2005 and 2.78 percent at December 31, 2004, to hedge against changes in the fair value of these senior notes. See Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk for further discussion regarding the treatment of our interest rate swaps. The remainder of our outstanding borrowings, including capital lease arrangements, was immaterial at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004. Equity We repurchased approximately 25 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $734 million in 2005, 10 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $360 million in 2004, and 22 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $570 million in 2003. Since 1992, we have repurchased approximately 132 million shares of our common stock and we have approximately 24 million shares of our common stock held in treasury at year end. Approximately 37 million shares remain under our previous share repurchase authorizations. Repurchased shares are available for reissuance under our equity incentive plans and for general corporate purposes, including strategic alliances and acquisitions. During 2005, we received $94 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the exercise patterns of employees. Guidant Acquisition At the effective time of the acquisition, each share of Guidant common stock will be converted into the right to receive (i) $42.00 in cash and (ii) a number of shares of Boston Scientific common stock equal to $38.00, subject to the calculation of the exchange ratio. See Note O—Subsequent Events to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details regarding the exchange ratio that will be used in determining the purchase price. Under the terms of the Abbott transaction agreement and at the closing of the Abbott transaction, Abbott has agreed to (1) pay an initial purchase price of $4.1 billion in cash plus potential future earn-out payments for the Guidant vascular and endovascular businesses, (2) make a five-year subordinated loan of $900 million to us at a 4.00 percent annual interest rate, and (3) purchase $1.4 billion in shares of Boston Scientific common stock. In connection with the financing of the cash portion of the purchase price, various banks have committed to providing up to $14 billion in financing, which includes a $7 billion 364-day interim credit facility, a $5 billion five-year term loan facility and a $2 billion five-year revolving credit facility. The interim credit facility, term loan and revolving credit facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus an interest margin between 0.30 percent (high A rating) and 0.85 percent (low BBB rating). The interest 52 margin will be based on the highest two out of three of our long-term, senior unsecured, corporate credit ratings from Moody's Investor Service, Inc., Standard & Poor's Rating Services and Fitch Ratings. Of the $14 billion available pursuant to the commitment letter, we expect to borrow approximately $7.1 billion to finance the cash portion of the Guidant acquisition purchase price, which includes the $5 billion five-year term loan facility and $2.1 billion in borrowings under the 364-day interim credit facility. We also expect to use the $900 million loan from Abbott, for a total of $8 billion in borrowings to finance the cash portion of the purchase price. In 2006, we anticipate filing a new public registration statement with the SEC under which we intend to issue senior notes in order to refinance any borrowings outstanding under the interim credit facility and to register shares that we will issue to Abbott. The new five-year revolving credit facility will replace our existing $2 billion credit facilities. We also plan to use cash on hand and cash from the Abbott transaction to fund the cash portion of the Guidant purchase price. If the acquisition is completed, we intend to dedicate a significant portion of our future cash flow from operations to repay our outstanding debt obligations. We currently have investment grade credit ratings. During February 2006, our credit rating was downgraded. The rating agencies have also indicated that they will further downgrade our credit ratings when the Guidant acquisition is consummated. However, we expect our credit ratings to remain at investment grade levels following the acquisition. Our credit ratings affect our cost of borrowings. If our credit ratings were to be downgraded below investment grade, our borrowing costs may increase and we may be subject to more stringent terms and conditions than those currently contained in our financing arrangements. In addition, our authorized common stock will be increased from 1,200,000,000 shares to 2,000,000,000 shares in conjunction with our proposed acquisition of Guidant. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments. See Notes D, F, H and O to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding our business combinations, long-term debt, lease arrangements, and subsequent events.

In addition, in conjunction with the acquisition of Guidant, Abbott has agreed to acquire Guidant's vascular intervention and endovascular businesses. See Note O—Subsequent Events to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details regarding the transaction. Certain of our business combinations involve the payment of contingent consideration. Certain of these payments are based on multiples of the acquired company's revenue during the earn-out period and, consequently, we cannot currently determine the total payments. However, we have developed an estimate of the maximum potential contingent consideration for each of our acquisitions with an outstanding earn-out obligation. At December 31, 2005, the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration (undiscounted) that we could be required to make associated with our business combinations is approximately $4 billion, some of which may be payable in our common stock. The milestones associated with the contingent consideration must be reached in certain future periods ranging from 2006 through 2016. The estimated cumulative specified revenue level associated with these maximum future contingent payments is approximately $10 billion. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, the acquired companies will reach their performance milestones or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues, the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above. In addition, we are currently considering the exercise of our option to acquire EndoTex Interventional Systems, Inc., a developer of stents used in the treatment of stenotic lesions in the carotid arteries. In conjunction with the acquisition of EndoTex, we would pay approximately $100 million in addition to our previous investments and notes issued of approximately $35 million, plus future consideration that is contingent upon EndoTex achieving certain performance-related milestones. Further, many of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future or require us to make certain payments that are contingent upon the company achieving certain product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, we will exercise our option to acquire these companies or be required to make these contingent payments, we have not included future potential payments relating to these equity investments in the table above. Critical Accounting Policies We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We describe these accounting polices in Note A—Significant Accounting Policies to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. These estimates are considered critical (1) if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (2) if materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas that we consider to be critical: Revenue Recognition Our revenue primarily consists of the sale of single-use medical devices. Revenue is considered to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a 54 sales arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. These criteria are generally met at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor, unless a consignment arrangement exists. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, which indicates that the sale is complete. We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. Our estimate for sales returns is based upon contractual commitments and historical trends and is recorded as a reduction to revenue. We offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. Inventories We state inventories at the lower of first-in, first-out cost or market. We base our provisions for excess or expired inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales levels. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future. We record provisions for inventory located in our manufacturing and distribution facilities as cost of sales. Consignment inventory write-downs are charged to selling, general and administrative expense and approximated $15 million in 2005, $10 million in 2004, and $8 million in 2003. Valuation of Business Combinations We record intangible assets acquired in recent business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative purchase price allocations and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods. The valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in-process projects. Our purchased research and development represents the value of in-process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We expense the value attributable to these in-process projects at the time of the acquisition. If the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects, or for the acquisitions as a whole. We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among other factors, the in-process projects' stage of completion, the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date, the costs 55 already incurred, the projected costs to complete, the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets, the expected introduction date and the estimated useful life of the technology. We base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors. For the in-process projects we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, we used the following risk-adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows: in 2005, 18 percent to 27 percent; in 2004, 18 percent to 27 percent; and in 2003, 24 percent. We believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects. Amortization and Impairment of Intangible Assets We record intangible assets at historical cost. We amortize our intangible assets subject to amortization, including patents, licenses, developed technology and core technology, using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives. We review these intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life. We also review our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment by calculating the fair value of our assets and comparing the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values. We test goodwill during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the test, we calculate the fair value of the reporting units as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The selection and use of an appropriate discount rate requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates. We have not recorded impairment of goodwill in any of the years included in our consolidated statements of operations. Investments in Strategic Alliances As of December 31, 2005, we had investments in 66 strategic alliances totaling $594 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had investments in 58 strategic alliances totaling $529 million. These assets primarily represent investments in privately held and publicly traded equity securities. We account for investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock. We account for investments in companies over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method. Our determination of whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an investment requires judgment. As of December 31, 2005, we held investments totaling $85 million in three companies that we accounted for under the equity method. Our ownership percentages in these companies range from approximately 21 percent to 28 percent. As of December 31, 2004, we held investments totaling $61 million in two companies that we accounted for under the equity method. Our ownership percentages in these companies range from approximately 25 percent to 30 percent. Factors that we consider in determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence include, but are not limited to: •our level of representation on the board of directors; •our participation in the investee's policy making processes; •transactions with the investee in the ordinary course of business; •interchange of managerial personnel; 56 •the investee's technological dependency on us; and •our ownership in relation to the concentration of other shareholdings. For investments accounted for under the equity method, we initially record the investment at cost, and adjust the carrying amount to reflect our share of the earnings or losses of the investee, including all adjustments similar to those made in preparing consolidated financial statements. Amounts recorded to adjust the carrying amounts of investments accounted for under the equity method were not material to our statements of operations in 2005, 2004 or 2003. When we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over an investee, we follow the cost method of accounting. We regularly review our strategic alliance investments for impairment indicators. Examples of events or circumstances that may indicate that an investment is impaired include, but are not limited to, a significant deterioration in earnings performance; a significant adverse change in the regulatory, economic or technological environment of an investee; or a significant doubt about an investee's ability to continue as a going concern. If we determine that impairment exists and it is other-than-temporary, we will reduce the carrying value of the investment to its estimated fair value and will recognize an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of operations. Our exposure to loss related to our strategic alliances is generally limited to our equity investments, notes receivable and intangible assets associated with these alliances. Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. We recognized net deferred tax liabilities aggregating $110 million at December 31, 2005 and $18 million at December 31, 2004. The liabilities relate principally to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions and earnings of our non-U.S. subsidiaries to be remitted in the future. The assets relate principally to the establishment of inventory and product-related reserves, purchased research and development, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. In light of our historical financial performance, we believe these assets will be substantially recovered. See Note I—Income Taxes to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a detailed analysis of our deferred tax positions. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years. We provide for income taxes payable related to earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that may be repatriated in the foreseeable future. Income taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where such earnings have been permanently reinvested in our foreign operations. It is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are permanently reinvested in foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that are permanently reinvested are $2,106 million at December 31, 2005 and $1,005 million at December 31, 2004. We provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, adequate provisions for income taxes have been made 57 for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which such determination is made. Legal Costs We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures. We accrue costs of settlement, damages and, under certain conditions, costs of defense when a loss is deemed probable and such costs are estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Our accrual for regulatory and litigation-related costs that were probable and estimable was $20 million at December 31, 2005 and $99 million at December 31, 2004. See further discussion of our individual material legal proceedings in Item 3. Legal Proceedings above and Note J—Commitments and Contingencies to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2005, a range of loss associated with these individual material legal proceedings can not be estimated due to uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the proceedings. Product Liability Costs and Securities Litigation Claims We are substantially self-insured with respect to general, product liability and securities litigation claims. In the normal course of business, product liability and securities litigation claims are asserted against us. We accrue anticipated costs of litigation and loss for product liability and securities litigation claims based on historical experience, or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. We record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. Our accrual for product liability and securities litigation claims was $15 million at December 31, 2005 and $13 million at December 31, 2004. Product liability and securities litigation claims against us will likely be asserted in the future related to events not known to management at the present time. The absence of significant third-party insurance coverage increases our exposure to unanticipated claims or adverse decisions. However, based on product liability and securities litigation losses experienced in the past, our election to become substantially self-insured is not expected to have a material impact on our future operations. Management believes that our risk management practices, including limited insurance coverage, are reasonably adequate to protect us against anticipated general, product liability and securities litigation losses. However, unanticipated catastrophic losses could have a material adverse impact on our financial position, results of operations and liquidity. Costs Associated with Exit Activities We accrue employee termination costs associated with an ongoing benefit arrangement if the obligation is attributed to prior services rendered, the rights to the benefits have vested and the payment is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. We generally record such costs into expense over the future service period, if any. In addition, in conjunction with an employee termination, we may offer voluntary termination benefits to employees. These benefits are recorded when the employee accepts the termination benefits and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Other costs associated with exit activities may include costs related to leased facilities to be abandoned or subleased and long-lived asset impairments. During 2005, we recorded charges associated with exit activities of approximately $40 million. These charges included costs primarily attributable to employee terminations and outsourcing costs 58 within our human resources function and international divisions; and a $10 million write-off of intangible assets related to our Enteryx Technology. The recognition of charges associated with exit activities requires our management to make judgments and estimates regarding the nature, timing, and amount of costs associated with the planned exit activity. Management's estimates of future liabilities may change, requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities already recorded. At the end of each reporting period, we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure their adequacy, that no excess accruals are retained and that utilization of the provisions are for their intended purposes in accordance with developed exit plans. New Accounting Standard During 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which is a revision of Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Statement No. 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees and amends Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. In general, Statement No. 123(R) contains similar accounting concepts as those described in Statement No. 123. However, Statement No. 123(R) requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. Alternative phase-in methods are allowed under Statement No. 123(R). We adopted Statement No. 123(R) on its effective date of January 1, 2006 using the ""modified-prospective method."" Under this method, compensation cost is recognized (a) based on the requirements of Statement No. 123(R) for all share-based payments granted on or after January 1, 2006 and (b) based on the requirements of Statement No. 123 for all unvested awards that were granted to employees prior to January 1, 2006. We expect to apply the Black-Scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of share-based payments to employees, which will then be amortized on a straight-line basis. As permitted by Statement No. 123, for periods prior to January 1, 2006, we accounted for share-based payments to employees using Opinion No. 25's intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognized no compensation cost for the granting of employee stock options, except as disclosed in Note L—Stock Ownership Plans to our 2005 consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Accordingly, the adoption of Statement No. 123(R)'s fair value method will negatively impact our statements of operations. The impact of adoption of Statement No. 123(R) cannot be quantified at this time because it will depend on the level of share-based payments granted in the future, expected volatilities and expected useful lives, among other factors, present at the grant date. However, had Statement No. 123(R) been effective in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement No. 123 as described in our disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per share in Note A—Significant Accounting Policies to our 2005 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Statement No. 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under currently effective accounting literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption of Statement No. 123(R). While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions was $28 million in 2005, $185 million in 2004 and $154 million in 2003. Further, most of our stock option awards provide for immediate vesting upon retirement, death or disability of the participant. We have traditionally accounted for the pro forma compensation expense related to stock-based awards made to retirement eligible individuals using the stated vesting period of the grant. This approach results in recognizing compensation expense over the vesting period except in the instance of the participant's actual retirement. Statement No. 123(R) clarified the accounting for 59 stock-based awards made to retirement eligible individuals, which explicitly provides that the vesting period for a grant made to a retirement eligible employee is considered non-substantive and should be ignored when determining the period over which the award should be expensed. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), we will be required to expense stock-based awards over the period between grant date and retirement eligibility or immediately if the employee is retirement eligible at the date of grant. If we had historically accounted for stock-based awards made to retirement eligible individuals under these requirements, the pro forma expense disclosed in Note A would not have been materially impacted for the periods presented. Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control system to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2005, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ JAMES R. TOBIN President and Chief Executive Officer /s/ LAWRENCE C. BEST Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 60 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Scientific Corporation We have audited management's assessment, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Boston Scientific Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporation's management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management's assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company's internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, management's assessment that Boston Scientific Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2005, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2005 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 24, 2006, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 24, 2006 61 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flow are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by monitoring outstanding positions. Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $3,593 million at December 31, 2005 and $4,171 million at December 31, 2004. The decrease in the outstanding amount of our currency derivative instruments is primarily due to the maturity of hedge contracts. We recorded $176 million of other assets and $55 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments at December 31, 2005 as compared to $70 million of other assets and $129 million of other liabilities recorded at December 31, 2004. A 10 percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar's value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments' fair value by $129 million at December 31, 2005 and by $163 million at December 31, 2004. A 10 percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar's value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments' fair value by $157 million at December 31, 2005 and $190 million at December 31, 2004. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or cash flow. Our earnings and cash flow are exposed to interest rate changes on U.S. dollar denominated debt partially offset by interest rate changes on U.S. dollar denominated cash investments. We use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting either floating-rate debt into fixed-rate debt or fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. We had interest rate swaps outstanding in the notional amount of $1,100 million at December 31, 2005 and $1,600 million at December 31, 2004. Our interest rate swaps hedge against potential changes in the fair value of certain of our senior notes and are designated as fair value hedges. The decrease in the notional amount of our interest rate swaps is due to the maturing of hedge contracts related to our $500 million 6.625 percent senior notes, which we repaid upon maturity during March 2005. To recognize the fair value of these interest rate swaps, we recorded $21 million of other assets and $7 million of other liabilities at December 31, 2005 as compared to $32 million of other assets and $1 million of other liabilities at December 31, 2004. A one percentage point increase in global interest rates would decrease the derivative instruments' fair value by $74 million at December 31, 2005 as compared to $84 million at December 31, 2004. A one percentage point decrease in global interest rates would increase the derivative instruments' fair value by $80 million at December 31, 2005 as compared to $92 million at December 31, 2004. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our interest rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying liability. 62",2023-12-30 19:41:51.298499
885725,BSX,BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORP,2007,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview Boston Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. Our mission is to improve the quality of patient care and the productivity of healthcare delivery through the development and advocacy of less-invasive medical devices and procedures. This mission is accomplished through the continuing refinement of existing products and procedures and the investigation and development of new technologies that can reduce risk, trauma, cost, procedure time and the need for aftercare. Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our quality policy, applicable to all employees, is “I improve the quality of patient care and all things Boston Scientific.” Our management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) begins with an overview of the Guidant acquisition, which represents a transforming event for Boston Scientific. It then provides an executive summary that outlines our financial highlights during 2006 and identifies some key trends that impacted operating results during the year. We supplement this summary with an in-depth look at the major issues we believe are most relevant to our current and future prospects. Next is an examination of the material changes in our operating results for 2006 as compared to 2005 and our operating results for 2005 as compared to 2004. The discussion then provides an examination of liquidity, focusing primarily on material changes in our operating, investing and financing cash flows, as depicted in our consolidated statements of cash flows, and the trends underlying these changes. Finally, the MD&A provides information on our critical accounting policies. Guidant Acquisition and Abbott Transaction On April 21, 2006, we consummated our acquisition of Guidant Corporation for an aggregate purchase price of $28.4 billion, which represented a combination of cash, common stock and fully vested stock options. The purchase price net of cash acquired was approximately $21.7 billion. In conjunction with the acquisition, we acquired approximately $6.7 billion of cash, including $4.1 billion in connection with Guidant’s prior sale of its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott Laboratories. With this acquisition, we have become a major provider in the more than $9 billion global Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) business, enhancing our overall competitive position and long-term growth potential and further diversifying our product portfolio. The acquisition has established us as one of the world’s largest cardiovascular device companies and a global leader in microelectronic therapeutics. Guidant makes a variety of implantable devices that can monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities, including tachycardia, heart failure and bradycardia. These devices include implantable cardioverter defibrillator systems (ICDs) and pacemaker systems. In addition, Guidant also makes cardiac surgery systems to perform cardiac surgical ablation, endoscopic vessel harvesting and clampless beating-heart bypass surgery. Prior to our acquisition of Guidant, Abbott acquired Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and agreed to share the drug-eluting technology it acquired from Guidant with Boston Scientific. This agreement gives us access to a second drug-eluting stent program, which will complement our existing TAXUS® stent system program. See Note D - Business Combinations to our 36 [Table of Contents] 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details on the transaction. We consolidated Guidant’s operating results with those of Boston Scientific beginning on the date of the acquisition, April 21, 2006. Since we have not restated our results retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Guidant, fluctuations in our operating results for 2006 are due primarily to the acquisition of Guidant. However, we have included supplemental pro forma financial information in Note D - Business Combinations to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K to give effect to the acquisition as though it had occurred at the beginning of 2006 and 2005. Executive Summary Our net sales in 2006 increased to $7.821 billion from $6.283 billion in 2005. Our reported net loss for 2006 was $3.577 billion, or $2.81 per diluted share, on approximately 1.274 billion weighted average shares outstanding as compared to net income of $628 million, or $0.75 per diluted share, on approximately 838 million weighted average shares outstanding in 2005. Our reported results included net after-tax charges primarily related to the acquisition of Guidant of $4.537 billion, or $3.55 per diluted share, in 2006 as compared to net after-tax charges of $894 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, in 2005.1 In addition, our cash provided by operating activities was $1.845 billion in 2006 as compared to $903 million in 2005. The growth in net sales resulted largely from our acquisition of Guidant, which accounted for sales of $1.503 billion. The geographic mix of Guidant sales included $1.025 billion of U.S. and $478 million of international sales. The business mix of Guidant sales consisted of $1.371 billion of CRM net sales and $132 million of Cardiac Surgery net sales. Our CRM net sales were comprised of $988 million of ICDs and $383 million of pacemaker systems. On a pro forma basis, assuming a full year of results, CRM sales were $2.026 billion in 2006 as compared to $2.28 billion in 2005. The decline, on a pro forma basis, was a result of lower average market shares for the Guidant devices in 2006 relative to 2005. We believe the lower market share, as well as reduced market growth rates, was due primarily to previous field actions in the industry. However, during the fourth quarter of 2006, we experienced a 10 percent sequential increase in net sales from our CRM business and a 13 percent increase for U.S. ICD sales, which we believe is a sign that our market share has increased and the CRM market is stabilizing and will return to growth. We remain focused on our share recovery. The increase in our sales as a result of the acquisition of Guidant was partially offset by a decrease in TAXUS stent system sales to $2.358 billion in 2006 from $2.556 billion in 2005. The geographic mix of TAXUS stent system sales in 2006 included $1.561 billion of U.S. and $797 million of international sales. In 2005, we had $1.763 billion of U.S. and $793 million of international sales. The decline in TAXUS sales during 2006 was attributable to a decrease in the U.S. market size due to recent uncertainty regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug-eluting stents and a decline in _________________________ 1 The 2006 net after-tax charges consisted of: $4.477 billion in expenses resulting from purchase accounting associated primarily with purchased research and development obtained as part of the Guidant acquisition and the step-up value of acquired Guidant inventory sold; $143 million in acquisition-related costs, including the fair value adjustment related to the sharing of proceeds feature of the Abbott stock purchase, a CRM technology offering charge and other business integration costs; a $31 million credit resulting primarily from the reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) program that we obtained as part of the TriVascular, Inc. acquisition; $81 million in write-downs attributable to our investment portfolio; and a $133 million one-time tax benefit for the reversal of tax accruals previously established for offshore unremitted earnings. The 2005 net after-tax charges consisted of a $598 million litigation settlement with Medinol Ltd. and $267 million in purchased research and development attributable primarily to our 2005 acquisitions. 37 [Table of Contents] average market shares in 2006 relative to 2005. Late stent thrombosis is the formation of a clot, or thrombus, within the stented area one year or more after implantation of the stent. Exiting 2005, the percentage of drug-eluting stents used in U.S. interventional procedures were in the high 80 percent range, as compared to U.S. drug-eluting stent market penetration rates in the low 70 percent range exiting 2006. Our U.S. drug-eluting stent market share declined throughout the first three quarters of 2005, but has been stable during 2006 and we have maintained our market leadership position. We expect to launch our TAXUS Express2™ stent system in the Japan market, which we believe exceeds $500 million, in the second half of 2007 and our TAXUS Liberté™ stent system in the U.S., subject to regulatory approvals. During 2006, our worldwide Endosurgery group sales increased to $1.346 billion from $1.228 billion in 2005, an increase of 10 percent. Further, our Neuromodulation division, formed following the June 2004 acquisition of Advanced Bionics Corporation, generated $234 million in net sales during 2006 as compared to $148 million in 2005, an increase of 58 percent. Our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, declined from 77.9 percent in 2005 to 71.8 percent in 2006 largely as a result of certain one-time purchase accounting adjustments associated with the Guidant acquisition. In addition, our gross profit declined by approximately 2.0 percentage points due to period expenses, including costs associated with Project Horizon, a corporate-wide cross-functional initiative to improve and harmonize our overall quality processes and systems. Our gross profit also declined by 0.8 percentage points due to shifts in our product sales mix toward lower margin products, including CRM products and lower sales of TAXUS stents in the U.S. Our operating expenses, excluding purchased research and development and litigation-related charges, increased $1.571 billion to $4.444 billion in 2006 from $2.873 billion in 2005. Of this increase, $1.299 billion related to operating expenses associated with the Guidant business. In the second half of 2006, we maintained existing spending levels given our expectation that the CRM market and the drug-eluting stent market will recover over time and this infrastructure will be necessary to support future growth. In addition, we announced our plan to reallocate certain CRM resources, including those in the research and development and sales and marketing functions; to increase innovation, productivity and competitiveness; and to enhance our ability to deliver new products to physicians and their patients. This plan resulted in a reduction of our CRM workforce by approximately 500 to 600 employees during the first quarter of 2007. We intend to reinvest the bulk of the savings from the plan back into the CRM business to create a strong, competitive pipeline that will help grow revenue that, combined with expense controls, should lead to increased profitability. The reinvestment will include additional hiring within the research and development function where there were shortages of desired skills. We continue to be focused on examining our operations in order to identify cost improvement measures and reallocate resources to support growth initiatives. At December 31, 2006, we had total outstanding debt of $8.902 billion, related primarily to the Guidant acquisition, cash of $1.668 billion and working capital of $2.271 billion. We continued to generate strong operating cash flow during 2006. We expect to use a portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our outstanding debt obligations over the next several years; our first upcoming debt maturity is in April 2008 for $650 million. 38 [Table of Contents] FDA Warning Letters On January 26, 2006, legacy Boston Scientific received a corporate warning letter from the FDA, notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three facilities and advising us that our corrective action plan relating to three site-specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. As stated in this FDA warning letter, the FDA may not grant our requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve pre-market approval (PMA) applications for class III devices to which the quality control or current good manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably related until the deficiencies have been corrected. During 2005, in order to strengthen our corporate-wide quality controls, we launched Project Horizon, a corporate-wide cross-functional initiative to improve and harmonize our overall quality processes and systems. As part of Project Horizon, we have made modifications to our process validation and complaint management systems. Project Horizon has resulted in the reallocation of significant internal engineering and management resources to quality initiatives, as well as incremental spending. It also has resulted in adjustments to product launch schedules of certain products and the decision to discontinue certain other product lines over time. In 2006, our Board of Directors created a Compliance and Quality Committee to monitor our compliance and quality initiatives. We believe we have identified solutions to the quality issues cited by the FDA, and we continue to make progress in transitioning our organization to implement those solutions. We communicate frequently and meet regularly with the FDA to apprise them of our progress. The FDA has communicated the need for us to complete substantially all remediation efforts before they will reinspect our facilities. We have engaged a third party to audit our enhanced quality systems in order to assess our corporate-wide compliance prior to reinspection by the FDA. We believe we will be ready for the third-party audit in the second quarter of 2007. On December 23, 2005, Guidant received an FDA warning letter citing certain deficiencies with respect to its manufacturing quality systems and record-keeping procedures in its CRM facility in St. Paul, Minnesota. This FDA warning letter followed an inspection by the FDA that was completed on September 1, 2005 and cited a number of observations. Guidant received a follow-up letter from the FDA dated January 5, 2006. As stated in this follow-up letter, until we have corrected the identified deficiencies, the FDA may not grant requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve PMA applications for class III devices to which the deficiencies described are reasonably related. The FDA conducted a further inspection of the CRM facility between December 15, 2005 and February 9, 2006 and made one additional inspectional observation. The FDA has concluded its reinspection of our CRM facilities. While we believe this reinspection went well, we may be required to take additional actions in order to comply with any FDA observations that we may receive. Outlook Guidant Acquisition On April 21, 2006, we consummated our acquisition of Guidant. With this acquisition, we have become a major provider in the more than $9 billion global CRM business, enhancing our overall competitive position and long-term growth potential and further diversifying our product portfolio. The acquisition has established us as one of the world’s largest cardiovascular device companies and a global leader in microelectronic therapeutics. The integration of Guidant’s operations and product lines with Boston Scientific’s is complex and time-consuming, and the separation of the Guidant businesses required by the Abbott transaction adds complexity to the transition process. We have entered transition services agreements with Abbott, under which Abbott and Boston Scientific provide or make available to each other certain services, rights, properties and assets for a temporary period. Many of these transition services agreements expire during 2007. The failure to integrate Boston Scientific and Guidant successfully and to manage the challenges presented by the transition process effectively, including the retention of key Guidant personnel and the 39 [Table of Contents] timely execution of activities under the transition services agreement, may reduce the anticipated potential benefits of the acquisition. During 2007, we will continue to incur integration and restructuring costs as we integrate certain operations of Guidant. In January 2007, we announced our plan to reallocate certain CRM resources, including those in research and development as well as sales and marketing functions, to increase innovation, productivity and competitiveness, and to enhance our ability to deliver new products to physicians and their patients. This plan resulted in a reduction of our CRM workforce by approximately 500 to 600 employees during the first quarter of 2007. There can be no assurances that we will realize efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses sufficient to offset incremental transaction, acquisition-related, integration and restructuring costs over time. Net sales from our CRM and Cardiac Surgery businesses were $1.503 billion for 2006, including $1.371 billion of CRM sales and $132 million of Cardiac Surgery sales. On a pro forma basis, assuming a full year of results, CRM sales were $2.026 billion in 2006 as compared to $2.28 billion in 2005. The decline, on a pro forma basis, was a result of lower average market shares for the Guidant devices in 2006 relative to 2005. We believe the lower market share, as well as reduced market growth rates, was due primarily to previous field actions in the industry. These field actions included Guidant’s decision announced on June 24, 2005 to stop selling Guidant’s leading defibrillator systems temporarily, which were returned to the market beginning on August 2, 2005. In addition, on June 26, 2006, we announced that we were retrieving a specific subset of pacemakers, cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers and ICDs due to a supplier’s low-voltage capacitor not performing consistently. We believe that these field actions contributed to our CRM division having a lower market share for ICDs and pacemaker systems for 2006 as compared to 2005. The worldwide CRM market growth rates, including the U.S. defibrillator market, declined during the first three quarters of 2006; these growth levels are below those experienced in recent years. The U.S. defibrillator market represents approximately half of the worldwide CRM market. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we experienced a 10 percent sequential increase in net sales from our CRM business and a 13 percent increase for U.S. ICD sales, which we believe is a sign that our market share has increased and the CRM market is stabilizing and will return to growth. We expect that growth rates in the worldwide CRM market, and the U.S. ICD market, will recover over several years. However, there can be no assurance that these markets will return to their historical growth rates or that we will be able to regain CRM market share or increase net sales in a timely manner, if at all. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the CRM market and our position within this market include: future product recalls or new physician advisories by us or our competitors; our ability to resolve the issues identified in the CRM warning letter to the satisfaction of the FDA; variations in clinical results, reliability or product performance of our and our competitors’ products; our ability to retain our sales force and other key personnel; our ability to reestablish the trust and confidence of the implanting community, the referring community and prospective patients in our technology; delayed or limited regulatory approvals; 40 [Table of Contents] our ability to launch next-generation products and technology features in a timely manner, if at all; international economic and regulatory conditions; new competitive launches; unfavorable reimbursement policies; declines in average selling prices; the overall number of procedures performed; and the outcome of legal proceedings related to our CRM business. We remain focused on our market share recovery and intend to accelerate recovery by regaining the trust and confidence of the implanting community, the referring community and prospective patients; continuing to improve our quality systems; investing in new technologies and clinical trials; retaining our sales force and other key personnel; continuing research and development productivity; and improving physician and patient communication. However, if these efforts are not successful, and the CRM market does not recover according to our expectations, or we are unable to regain market share and net sales on a timely basis, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Coronary Stent Business Coronary stent revenue represented approximately 32 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2006, as compared to 43 percent in 2005, primarily as a result of the Guidant acquisition. We estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market approximated $6 billion in 2006, and estimate that drug-eluting stents represented approximately 90 percent of the dollar value of the worldwide coronary stent market in 2006. The U.S. drug-eluting stent market for 2006 approximated $3 billion. Our U.S. TAXUS sales declined to $1.561 billion for 2006 as compared to $1.763 billion for 2005. Recent uncertainty regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug-eluting stents contributed to a decline in the U.S. stent market size. In addition to the decline in U.S. drug-eluting stent market penetration, device utilization per procedure and overall percutaneous coronary intervention volume has decreased likely due to market conservatism. We believe this conservatism is a temporary circumstance that, if alleviated, may lead to an increase in future procedural volume and usage of drug-eluting stents. In the fourth quarter of 2006, the FDA held a special advisory panel meeting to discuss drug-eluting stents. Members of the panel concluded that drug-eluting stents remain safe and effective when used as indicated, and that the benefits outweigh the risks. We believe that percutaneous coronary interventions, device utilization per procedure and drug-eluting stent penetration rates will increase in the future, and result in a market recovery; however, there can be no assurance that this will happen or that the market will recover to previous levels. We expect that our U.S. drug-eluting stent sales in 2007 may be below those experienced in 2006. During 2006, our international TAXUS stent system net sales remained consistent with 2005. Drug-eluting stent penetration rates increased during the first half of 2006, and remained relatively flat throughout the second half of 2006 and exiting 2006, the effect of which offset declines in our market share associated with several competitive launches of new drug-eluting stent products in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets. We expect competitive launches in these geographies to continue to put pressure on our market share and average selling prices in 2007. In addition, we expect that drug-eluting stent penetration rates will remain relatively consistent in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets during 2007 due primarily to concerns regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis. Subject to regulatory 41 [Table of Contents] approval, we expect to launch our TAXUS Express 2 stent system in Japan during the second half of 2007, where we estimate a drug-eluting stent market size exceeding $500 million. Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial end points. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market’s perception of this clinical data, may adversely impact our position in and share of the drug-eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market. However, we believe that we can maintain a leadership position within the drug-eluting stent markets in which we compete for a variety of reasons, including: the results of our TAXUS clinical trials; the performance benefits of our current technology; the strength of our pipeline of drug-eluting stent products and the planned launch sequence of these products; our overall market leadership in interventional medicine and our sizeable interventional cardiology sales force; our significant investments in our sales, clinical, marketing and manufacturing capabilities; and our second drug-eluting stent platform obtained as a result of our Guidant acquisition. However, a material decline in our drug-eluting stent revenue would have a significant adverse impact on our future operating results. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug-eluting coronary stent market and our position within this market include: continued concerns regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis; the entry of additional competitors in international markets and the U.S.; continued physician and patient confidence in our technology and attitudes toward drug-eluting stents; our ability to resolve the issues identified in the current legacy Boston Scientific corporate warning letter to the satisfaction of the FDA; declines in the average selling prices of drug-eluting stent systems; variations in clinical results or product performance of our and our competitors’ products; delayed or limited regulatory approvals; the overall number of procedures performed; unfavorable reimbursement policies; 42 [Table of Contents] intellectual property litigation; the average number of stents used per procedure; our ability to maintain and expand indications for use; our ability to launch next-generation products and technology features; the international adoption rate of drug-eluting stent technology; international economic and regulatory conditions; and the level of supply of our drug-eluting stent systems and competitive stent systems. The TAXUS drug-eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug-eluting products in the U.S. market. Our share of the drug-eluting stent market, as well as unit prices, may be adversely impacted as additional significant competitors enter the drug-eluting stent market, which could occur as early as the second half of 2007 in the U.S. Prior to our acquisition of Guidant, Abbott acquired Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and agreed to share the drug-eluting technology it acquired from Guidant with Boston Scientific, including the XIENCE™ V everolimus-eluting coronary stent system. In October of 2006, we received CE mark approval to begin marketing the PROMUS™ stent system, which is a private-labeled XIENCE V drug-eluting coronary stent system supplied to us by Abbott. During the fourth quarter of 2006, we initiated a limited launch of the PROMUS stent system in certain European countries. We expect to launch the PROMUS stent system in certain Inter-Continental countries in the second quarter of 2007 and in the U.S. in 2008, subject to regulatory approval. Under the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the profit margin of a PROMUS stent system will be significantly lower than our TAXUS drug-eluting stent. Therefore, the mix of PROMUS stent system revenue relative to our total drug-eluting stent revenue could have a negative impact on our overall profitability as a percentage of revenue. In addition, we will incur incremental costs and expend incremental resources in order to develop and commercialize products utilizing the Guidant drug-eluting stent system technology and to support the launch of our internally manufactured everolimus-eluting stent system in the future, which we expect will have profit margins more comparable to our TAXUS stent system. Regulatory Compliance In January 2006, legacy Boston Scientific received a corporate warning letter from the FDA, notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three facilities. During 2005, in order to strengthen our corporate-wide quality controls, we launched Project Horizon, which has resulted in the reallocation of significant internal engineering and management resources to quality initiatives, as well as incremental spending. It also has resulted in adjustments to product launch schedules of certain products and the decision to discontinue certain other product lines over time. See the FDA Warning Letters section above for further information regarding the FDA warning letters. There can be no assurances regarding the length of time or cost it will take us to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the FDA. Our inability to resolve these issues in a timely manner may further delay product launch schedules, including the U.S. launch of our TAXUS Liberté stent, which may weaken our competitive position in the markets in which we participate. If our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the FDA, we may have to devote additional financial and human resources to our efforts, and the FDA may take further regulatory actions against us, including, but not limited to, seizing our product inventory, 43 [Table of Contents] obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products, issuing a consent decree or assessing civil monetary penalties. Intellectual Property Litigation There continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market. We are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings with our existing competitors, including Johnson & Johnson and Medtronic, Inc. There can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings would not impact our ability to meet our objectives in the market. See Note J - Commitments and Contingencies to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a description of these legal proceedings. Innovation Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our research and development program is largely focused on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions. As a result of our agreement with Abbott, we now have access to a second drug-eluting stent program, which will complement our existing TAXUS stent system program. We expect to continue to invest in our paclitaxel drug-eluting stent program, along with our internally manufactured everolimus-eluting stent program, to continue to sustain our worldwide drug-eluting stent market leadership position. During 2007, we expect to incur incremental capital expenditures and research and development expenses as a result of our dual drug-eluting stent program. We successfully launched our next-generation drug-eluting stent product, the TAXUS Liberté stent system, during 2005 in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets. We expect to launch our TAXUS Liberté stent system in the U.S., subject to regulatory approval. In addition, we expect to continue to invest in our CRM technologies, including our LATITUDE® Patient Management System, which is technology that enables physicians to monitor device performance remotely while patients remain in their homes, and the Frontier™ CRM technology, our next-generation pulse generator platform. In October 2006, the FDA approved expansion of our LATITUDE System to be used for remote monitoring in certain existing ICDs and cardiac resynchronization defibrillators. We also expect to invest selectively in areas outside of drug-eluting stent and CRM technologies. There can be no assurance that these technologies will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our future growth. Our acquisitions and alliances are intended to expand further our ability to offer our customers effective, high-quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. Management believes it has developed a sound plan to integrate acquired businesses. However, our failure to integrate these businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic and financial objectives of these transactions. Potential future acquisitions, including companies with whom we currently have strategic alliances or options to purchase, or the fulfillment of our contingent consideration obligations may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing, depending on their size and nature. Further, in connection with these acquisitions and other strategic alliances, we have acquired numerous in-process research and development projects. As we continue to undertake strategic growth initiatives, it is reasonable to assume that we will acquire additional in-process research and development projects. In addition, we have entered a significant number of strategic alliances with privately held and publicly traded companies. Many of these alliances involve equity investments and often give us the option to acquire the other company or assets of the other company in the future. We enter these strategic alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets. The success of these alliances is an element of our growth strategy and we will continue to seek 44 [Table of Contents] market opportunities and growth through selective strategic alliances and acquisitions. However, the full benefit of these alliances is often dependent on the strength of the other companies’ underlying technology and ability to execute. An inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings, or litigation related to these technologies, among other factors, may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these alliances. Even though we believe that the drug-eluting stent market and CRM market will recover above existing levels, there can be no assurance to the timing or extent of this recovery. In 2007, we will continue to reprioritize our internal research and development project portfolio and our external investment portfolio primarily based on expectations of future market growth. This reprioritization may result in our decision to sell, discontinue, write-down, or otherwise reduce the funding of certain projects, operations, investments or assets. Any proceeds from sales, or any increases in operating cash flows, resulting from such management actions may be used to reduce debt or may be reinvested in other research and development projects or other operational initiatives. Reimbursement and Funding Our products are purchased by hospitals, doctors and other healthcare providers who are reimbursed by third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed-care programs, for the healthcare services provided to their patients. Third-party payors may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on assessment criteria as determined by the third-party payor. Reimbursement by third-party payors for these services is based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services’ assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value. These reimbursement methodologies confer different, and often conflicting, levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients, and these methodologies are subject to frequent refinements. There is no way of predicting the outcome of reimbursement decisions, or their impact on our operating results. Third-party payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. There can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by third-party payors, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third-party payors’ coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. International Markets International markets are also being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs. Our sales growth and profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions, currency fluctuations, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development, rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy. Any significant changes in the competitive, political, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, we are required to receive or renew regulatory approvals and obtain exportation certificates to foreign governments in order to market our products in certain international jurisdictions. These approvals and certificates could be impacted by the FDA warning letters we have received. If these approvals and certificates are not renewed or obtained on a timely basis, our ability to market our full line of existing products within these jurisdictions may be limited, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. 45 [Table of Contents] Results of Operations Net Sales The following table provides our net sales by region and the relative change on an as reported and constant currency basis: 2006 versus 2005 2005 versus 2004 (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 As Reported Currency Basis Constant Currency Basis As Reported Currency Basis Constant Currency Basis United States $ 4,840 $ 3,852 $ 3,502 26 % 26 % 10 % 10 % Europe 1,574 1,161 994 36 % 34 % 17 % 17 % Japan 594 579 613 3 % 8 % (6 %) (4 %) Inter-Continental 813 691 515 18 % 16 % 34 % 28 % International 2,981 2,431 2,122 23 % 22 % 15 % 13 % Worldwide $ 7,821 $ 6,283 $ 5,624 24 % 24 % 12 % 11 % The following table provides our worldwide net sales by division and the relative change on an as reported basis: (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006 versus 2005 2005 versus 2004 Interventional Cardiology $ 3,612 $ 3,783 $ 3,451 (5 %) 10 % Peripheral Interventions/ Vascular Surgery 666 715 656 (7 %) 9 % Electrophysiology 134 132 130 2 % 2 % Neurovascular 326 277 253 18 % 9 % Cardiac Surgery 132 N/A N/A N/A N/A Cardiac Rhythm Management 1,371 N/A N/A N/A N/A Cardiovascular 6,241 4,907 4,490 27 % 9 % Oncology 221 207 186 7 % 11 % Endoscopy 754 697 641 8 % 9 % Urology 371 324 261 15 % 24 % Endosurgery 1,346 1,228 1,088 10 % 13 % Neuromodulation 234 148 46 58 % 222 % Worldwide $ 7,821 $ 6,283 $ 5,624 24 % 12 % We manage our international operating regions and divisions on a constant currency basis, while market risk from currency exchange rate changes is managed at the corporate level. The relative change on a constant currency basis by division approximated the change on an as reported basis. To calculate regional and divisional revenue growth rates that exclude the impact of currency exchange, we convert actual current-period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant currency exchange rates. 46 [Table of Contents] U.S. Net Sales In 2006, our U.S. net sales increased by $988 million, or 26 percent, as compared to 2005. The increase is related primarily to the inclusion of $1.025 billion of U.S. net sales from our new CRM and Cardiac Surgery divisions. In addition, we experienced increases in our U.S. net sales related to sales growth of $83 million from our Endosurgery group and $75 million from our Neuromodulation division. Offsetting this increase were declines in our U.S. net sales of TAXUS coronary stent systems to $1.561 billion for 2006 as compared to $1.763 billion for 2005 and sales decreases of approximately $70 million in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to the expiration during the first quarter of 2006 of our agreement to distribute certain third-party guidewire and sheath products. The decline in TAXUS sales was due principally to a decrease in the U.S. drug-eluting stent market size and a decline in average TAXUS market share in 2006 relative to 2005. The drug-eluting stent market decline was due to recent uncertainty regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug-eluting stents, which resulted in conservative usage by physicians. The overall size of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market is driven primarily by the number of percutaneous coronary interventional procedures performed; the number of devices used per procedure; the drug-eluting stent penetration rate or mix between bare metal and drug-eluting stents across procedures; and average drug-eluting stent selling prices. The primary reason for the decline in the U.S. drug-eluting stent market size was lower penetration rates in 2006 relative to 2005. Exiting 2005, the percentage of drug-eluting stents used in U.S. interventional procedures were in the high 80 percent range, as compared to U.S. drug-eluting stent market penetration rates in the low 70 percent range exiting 2006. The drug-eluting stent market also declined due to decreases in the number of devices used per procedure and slight reductions in average selling prices. Our drug-eluting stent market share declined throughout the first three quarters of 2005, but has been stable during 2006. See the Outlook section for a more detailed discussion of the drug-eluting stent market and our position within that market. In 2005, our U.S. net sales increased by $350 million, or 10 percent, as compared to 2004. The increase resulted largely from a full year of TAXUS stent system sales, which we launched in March 2004. U.S. TAXUS stent system sales for 2005 were $1.763 billion as compared to $1.57 billion for 2004, offset by a reduction in market share compared to the prior year. The remainder of the increase in our U.S. net sales related to sales growth of $83 million from our Endosurgery group and $75 million from our Neuromodulation division. International Net Sales In 2006, our international net sales increased by $550 million, or 23 percent, as compared to 2005. The increase related primarily to the inclusion of $478 million of international net sales from our new CRM and Cardiac Surgery divisions. The remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to growth in various product franchises, including $35 million in net sales from our Endosurgery group and $27 million in sales growth from our Neurovascular division. TAXUS stent system sales in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets were $797 million in 2006 as compared to $793 million in 2005. TAXUS stent system sales were favorably impacted by drug-eluting stent penetration rates in these markets. The drug-eluting stent penetration rates increased during the first half of 2006, and remained relatively flat throughout the second half of 2006 and exiting 2006. Market share declines associated with several competitors having launched new drug-eluting stent products in these markets offset the favorable impact of increased penetration rates. In 2006, our legacy Boston Scientific net sales in Japan, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, were relatively consistent with the prior year. Due to the timing of regulatory approval for our TAXUS stent system and government-mandated pricing reductions for other products, we do not expect significant revenue growth in our legacy Japan business until we launch our TAXUS Express2 stent system in Japan, 47 [Table of Contents] which we expect to occur during the second half of 2007. Japan net sales for 2006 included $62 million from CRM and Cardiac Surgery products. In 2005, our international net sales increased by $309 million, or 15 percent, as compared to 2004. The increase related primarily to sales growth of our TAXUS stent system by $220 million, or 38 percent, in our Europe and Inter-Continental markets. This increase in TAXUS stent system sales in these markets was primarily the result of increased market penetration rates, as well as the successful launch of our TAXUS Liberté stent system during 2005. The remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to growth in various product franchises, including $57 million in incremental sales from our Endosurgery group and $27 million in sales growth from our Neuromodulation division. Gross Profit The following table provides a summary of our gross profit: 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales Gross profit 5,614 71.8 4,897 77.9 4,332 77.0 In 2006, our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, decreased by 6.1 percentage points as compared to 2005. Our gross profit for 2006 decreased as a percentage of net sales by 3.8 percentage points as compared to 2005 due to costs associated with Guidant, including $267 million in step-up value of acquired Guidant inventory sold during the period and a $31 million charge associated with making our LATITUDE Patient Management System available to many of our existing CRM patients without additional charge. In connection with the accounting for the Guidant acquisition, we wrote up inventory acquired from manufacturing cost to fair value. As of December 31, 2006, we had no inventory step-up value remaining in inventory. In addition, our gross profit for 2006 decreased as a percentage of net sales by approximately 2.0 percentage points as compared to 2005 due to period expenses, including costs associated with Project Horizon and certain inventory charges. Shifts in our product sales mix toward lower margin products, including CRM products and lower sales of TAXUS stents in the U.S., decreased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.8 percentage points. These decreases were offset by a 0.8 percentage point increase due to the favorable change in currency exchange rates on our gross profit. In 2005, our gross profit, as a percentage of net sales, increased by 0.9 percentage points as compared to 2004. Our 2004 gross profit decreased by approximately 1.0 percentage points due to $57 million in inventory write-downs, including a $43 million write-down attributable to recalls of certain of our coronary stent systems and a $14 million write-down of TAXUS stent inventory due to shelf-life dating. In addition, shifts in our product sales mix toward higher margin products, primarily TAXUS stents, increased our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by 0.6 percentage points. Our gross profit for 2005 was reduced as a percentage of net sales by 0.9 percentage points related to period expenses, including manufacturing start-up costs primarily associated with our TAXUS Liberté stent system and increased investment in quality initiatives. The remaining fluctuation in gross profit as a percentage of net sales primarily related to the favorable change in currency exchange rates. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses, excluding purchased research and development and litigation-related charges, increased $1.571 billion to $4.444 billion in 2006 from $2.873 billion in 2005. Of this increase, $1.299 billion related to operating expenses associated with the Guidant business. The significant increase in 48 [Table of Contents] each of our operating expense categories is primarily a result of Guidant operating expenses. The following table provides a summary of our operating expenses, excluding purchased research and development and litigation-related charges: 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,675 34.2 1,814 28.9 1,742 31.0 Research and development expenses 1,008 12.9 680 10.8 569 10.1 Royalty expense 231 3.0 227 3.6 195 3.5 Amortization expense 530 6.8 152 2.4 112 2.0 Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses In 2006, our SG&A expenses increased by $861 million, or 47 percent, as compared to 2005. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses increased to 34.2 percent in 2006 from 28.9 percent for the same period in the prior year. The increase in our SG&A expenses related primarily to: $670 million in expenditures associated with Guidant; $65 million of acquisition-related costs associated primarily with certain Guidant integration and retention programs; increases of $63 million due primarily to increased headcount attributable to the expansion of our sales force within our international regions and Neuromodulation division; and $55 million in incremental stock-based compensation expense associated with the adoption of Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment. See the Critical Accounting Policies section and Note L - Stock Ownership Plans for a more detailed discussion of Statement No. 123(R). SG&A expenses for 2005 included $21 million in costs related to certain business optimization initiatives and $17 million in costs related to certain retirement benefits. In 2005, our SG&A expenses increased by $72 million, or four percent, as compared to 2004. The increase primarily related to: approximately $100 million in increased headcount and higher compensation expense mainly attributable to the expansion of the sales force within our Interventional Cardiology business unit and Endosurgery group and costs related to market development initiatives; $75 million in incremental operating expenses associated with our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions, primarily Advanced Bionics; $21 million in costs related to certain business optimization initiatives; $19 million in stock-based compensation expense associated primarily with the issuance of deferred stock units in 2005; and $17 million in costs related to certain retirement benefits. Certain charges incurred in 2004 partially offset these increases, including a $110 million enhancement to our 401(k) Plan, and a $90 million non-cash charge resulting from certain modifications to our stock option plans. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 28.9 percent in 2005 from 31.0 percent in 2004 primarily due to the increase in our net sales in 2005. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses Our investment in R&D reflects spending on regulatory compliance and clinical research as well as new product development programs. In 2006, our R&D expenses increased by $328 million, or 48 percent, as compared to 2005. As a percentage of our net sales, R&D expenses increased to 12.9 percent in 2006 from 10.8 percent in 2005. The increase primarily related to: the inclusion of $270 million in expenditures associated with Guidant; approximately $30 million in costs related to the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program; $24 million of stock-based compensation expense associated with the adoption of Statement No. 123(R); and $13 million of acquisition-related costs associated with certain Guidant 49 [Table of Contents] integration and retention programs. See the Purchased Research and Development section for further discussion regarding the cancellation of our TriVascular AAA stent-graft program. In 2005, our R&D expenses increased by $111 million, or 20 percent, as compared to 2004. As a percentage of net sales, R&D expenses increased to 10.8 percent in 2005 from 10.1 percent in 2004. The increase related primarily to an increased investment of approximately $60 million in incremental R&D expense attributable to our 2004 and 2005 acquisitions, primarily Advanced Bionics and TriVascular. In addition, we increased spending on internal R&D projects within our Endosurgery group by $25 million. Royalty Expense In 2006, our royalty expense increased by $4 million, or 2 percent, as compared to 2005. The increase was due to $25 million of royalty expense associated with the CRM and Cardiac Surgery products that we acquired as part of the Guidant acquisition. This increase was offset by a decrease in royalty expense attributable to sales of our TAXUS stent system by $20 million to $153 million for 2006 as compared to the prior year due primarily to lower sales volume. As a percentage of net sales, royalty expense decreased to 3.0 percent in 2006 from 3.6 percent in 2005. This decrease was primarily a result of the inclusion of net sales from our new CRM and Cardiac Surgery products, which on average have a lower royalty cost relative to legacy Boston Scientific net sales. In 2005, our royalty expense increased by $32 million, or 16 percent, as compared to 2004. As a percentage of net sales, royalty expense increased to 3.6 percent in 2005 from 3.5 percent in 2004. The increase in our royalty expense related to sales growth of royalty-bearing products, primarily sales of our TAXUS stent system. Royalty expense attributable to sales of our TAXUS stent system increased by $27 million to $174 million for 2005 as compared to 2004. Amortization Expense In 2006, our amortization expense increased by $378 million, or 249 percent, as compared to 2005. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense increased to 6.8 percent in 2006 from 2.4 percent in 2005. The increase in our amortization expense related primarily to: $334 million of amortization of intangible assets obtained as part of the Guidant acquisition; $23 million for the write-off of intangible assets due to the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program; $21 million for the write-off of the intangible assets associated with developed technology obtained as part of our 2005 acquisition of Rubicon Medical Corporation; and $12 million for the write-off of the intangible assets associated with our Real-time Position Management System (RPM) technology, a discontinued technology platform obtained as part of our acquisition of Cardiac Pathways Corporation. The write-off of the RPM intangible assets resulted from our decision to cease investment in the technology. The write-off of the Rubicon developed technology resulted from our decision to redesign the first generation of the technology and concentrate resources on the development and commercialization of the next-generation product. We do not expect these program cancellations and related write-offs to impact our future operations or cash flows materially. Amortization expense for 2005 included a $10 million write-off of intangible assets related to our Enteryx® Liquid Polymer Technology, a discontinued technology platform obtained as a part of our acquisition of Enteric Medical Technologies, Inc.. The write-off resulted from our decision during 2005 to cease selling the Enteryx product. In 2005, our amortization expense increased by $40 million, or 36 percent, as compared to 2004. As a percentage of our net sales, amortization expense increased to 2.4 percent in 2005 from 2.0 percent in 2004. The increase in our amortization expense was due primarily to $25 million in incremental amortization expense from the intangible assets obtained in conjunction with our 2004 and 2005 50 [Table of Contents] acquisitions, primarily Advanced Bionics. In addition, amortization expense included a $10 million write-off of intangible assets related to Enteryx. Interest Expense Our interest expense increased to $435 million in 2006 as compared to $90 million in 2005. The increase in our interest expense related primarily to an increase in our average debt levels used to finance the Guidant acquisition, as well as an increase in our weighted-average borrowing cost. Our average debt levels for 2006 increased to approximately $7.2 billion as compared to approximately $2.4 billion for 2005. Our weighted-average borrowing cost for 2006 increased to 6.1 percent from 3.8 percent for 2005. At December 31, 2006, $5.886 billion, or 81 percent, of our approximately $7.234 billion in outstanding net debt is at fixed interest rates. Our interest expense increased to $90 million in 2005 from $64 million in 2004. The increase in 2005 as compared to 2004 related primarily to an increase in average market interest rates on our borrowings. Fair Value Adjustment During 2006, we recorded net expense of $95 million to reflect the change in fair value related to the sharing of proceeds feature of the Abbott stock purchase, which is discussed in further detail at Note D- Business Combinations to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. This sharing of proceeds feature is being marked-to-market through earnings based upon changes in our stock price, among other factors. Other, net Our other, net reflected expense of $56 million in 2006, income of $13 million in 2005 and expense of $16 million in 2004. Our other, net included investment write-downs of $121 million in 2006, $17 million in 2005 and $58 million in 2004, in each case attributable to an other-than-temporary decline in fair value of certain strategic alliances. These write-downs were partially offset by realized gains on investments of $9 million in 2006, $4 million in 2005 and $36 million in 2004. Our write-downs during 2006 included charges of $34 million associated with investment write-downs due primarily to the termination of a gene therapy trial being conducted by one of our portfolio companies. In addition, we recorded $27 million of investment write-downs related to one of our vascular sealing portfolio companies due to continued delays in its technology development and the resulting deterioration in its financial condition. The remaining investment write-downs were not individually significant. We do not expect these write-downs to impact our future operations or cash flows materially. In addition, our other, net included interest income of $67 million in 2006, $36 million in 2005 and $20 million in 2004. Our interest income increased in 2006 as compared to 2005 due primarily to increases in our cash and cash equivalents balances and increases in average market interest rates. Our interest income in 2005 increased as compared to 2004 due to increases in average market interest rates. 51 [Table of Contents] Tax Rate The following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) 2006 2005 2004 2006 versus 2005 2005 versus 2004 Reported tax rate 1.2% 29.5% 28.9% (28.3) 0.6 Impact of certain charges (20.2%) 5.5% 4.9% (25.7) 0.6 In 2006, the decrease in our reported tax rate as compared to 2005 related primarily to the impact of certain charges during 2006 that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These charges include: purchased research and development; asset write-downs; reversal of taxes associated with unremitted earnings; and tax gain on the sale of intangible assets. As of December 31, 2005, we had recorded a $133 million deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we had anticipated repatriating in the foreseeable future. During 2006, we made a significant acquisition that, when combined with certain changes in business conditions subsequent to the acquisition, resulted in a reevaluation of this liability. We have determined that we will not repatriate these earnings in the foreseeable future and, instead, we will indefinitely reinvest these earnings in foreign operations to repay debt obligations associated with the acquisition. As a result, we reversed the deferred tax liability and reduced income tax expense by $133 million in 2006. We currently estimate that our 2007 effective tax rate, excluding certain charges, will be approximately 21 percent due primarily to our intention to reinvest offshore substantially all of our offshore earnings. However, acquisitions or dispositions in 2007 and geographic changes in the manufacture of our products may positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate. In 2005, the increase in our reported tax rate as compared to 2004 related primarily to the impact of certain charges during 2005 that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These charges include: certain litigation-related charges; purchased research and development; asset write-downs and employee-related costs that resulted from certain business optimization initiatives; costs related to certain retirement benefits; and a tax adjustment associated with a technical correction made to the American Jobs Creation Act. Litigation-Related Charges In 2005, we recorded a $780 million pre-tax charge associated with the Medinol litigation settlement. On September 21, 2005, we reached a settlement with Medinol resolving certain contract and patent infringement litigation. In conjunction with the settlement agreement, we paid $750 million in cash and cancelled our equity investment in Medinol. In 2004, we recorded a $75 million provision for certain legal and regulatory matters, which included a civil settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice, which we paid in 2005. See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Item 3. Legal Proceedings above and Note J — Commitments and Contingencies to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Purchased Research and Development During 2006, we recorded $4.119 billion of purchased research and development. This amount included a charge of approximately $4.169 billion associated with the purchased research and development obtained 52 [Table of Contents] in conjunction with the Guidant acquisition; a credit of approximately $67 million resulting primarily from the reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program; and an expense of approximately $17 million resulting primarily from the application of equity method accounting for our investment in EndoTex Interventional Systems. The $4.169 billion of purchased research and development associated with the Guidant acquisition consists primarily of approximately $3.26 billion for acquired CRM-related products and approximately $540 million for drug-eluting stent technology shared with Abbott. The purchased research and development value associated with the Guidant acquisition also includes approximately $369 million that represents the estimated fair value of the potential milestone payments of up to $500 million that we may receive from Abbott upon receipt of certain regulatory approvals by the vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses it acquired from Guidant. We recorded the amounts as purchased research and development at the acquisition date because the receipt of the payments is dependent on future research and development activity and regulatory approvals, and the asset has no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. The most significant purchased research and development projects acquired from Guidant include the Frontier CRM technology and rights to the everolimus-eluting stent technology that we share with Abbott. The Frontier CRM technology represents Guidant’s next-generation pulse generator platform that will incorporate new components and software while leveraging certain existing intellectual property, technology, manufacturing know-how and institutional knowledge of Guidant. We expect to leverage this platform across all CRM product lines to treat electrical dysfunction in the heart. We expect to launch various Frontier-based products commercially in the U.S. over the next 36 months, subject to regulatory approval. As of December 31, 2006, we estimate that the total costs to complete the Frontier CRM technology is between $150 million and $200 million. We expect material cash inflows from Frontier-based products to commence in 2008. The $540 million attributable to the everolimus-eluting stent technology represents the estimated fair value of the rights to Guidant’s everolimus-based drug-eluting stent technology we share with Abbott. In December 2006, we launched PROMUS, our first-generation everolimus-based stent, supplied by Abbott, in limited quantities in Europe. We expect to launch a first-generation everolimus-eluting stent, supplied by Abbott, in the U.S. in 2008, subject to regulatory approval. We expect to launch an internally manufactured next-generation everolimus-based stent in Europe in 2010 and in the U.S. in 2011. We expect that material net cash inflows (net of operating costs, including research and development costs to complete) from our internally manufactured everolimus-based drug-eluting stent will commence in 2010 or 2011, following its approval in Europe and in the U.S. As of December 31, 2006, we estimate that the cost to complete the next-generation everolimus-eluting stent technology project is between $200 million and $250 million. The in-process projects acquired in conjunction with the Guidant acquisition are generally progressing in line with our estimates as of the acquisition date. In 2005, we recorded $276 million of purchased research and development. Our 2005 purchased research and development consisted of: $130 million relating to our acquisition of TriVascular; $73 million relating to our acquisition of Advanced Stent Technologies, Inc. (AST); $45 million relating to our acquisition of Rubicon; and $3 million relating to our acquisition of CryoVascular Systems, Inc. In addition, we recorded $25 million of purchased research and development in conjunction with obtaining distribution rights for new brain monitoring technology that Aspect Medical Systems, one of our strategic partners, is currently developing. This technology is designed to aid the diagnosis and treatment of depression, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological conditions. The most significant 2005 purchased research and development projects included TriVascular’s AAA stent-graft and AST’s Petal™ bifurcation stent, which collectively represented 73 percent of our 2005 53 [Table of Contents] purchased research and development. During the second quarter of 2006, management cancelled the TriVascular AAA stent-graft program. The program cancellation was due principally to forecasted increases in time and costs to complete the development of the stent-graft and to receive regulatory approval. We do not expect the program cancellation and related write-downs to impact our future operations or cash flows materially. The cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program resulted in the shutdown of our facility in Santa Rosa, California and the displacement of approximately 300 employees. During 2006, we recorded a charge to research and development expenses of approximately $20 million associated primarily with write-downs of fixed assets and a charge to research and development expenses of approximately $10 million associated with severance and related costs incurred in connection with the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program. In addition, we recorded an impairment charge related to the remaining TriVascular intangible assets and reversed our accrual for contingent payments recorded in the initial purchase accounting. The effect of the write-off of these assets and liabilities was a $23 million charge to amortization expense and a $67 million credit to purchased research and development during the second quarter of 2006. We completed substantially the shutdown activities during the third quarter of 2006. AST’s Petal bifurcation stent is designed to expand into the side vessel where a single vessel branches into two vessels, permitting blood to flow into both branches of the bifurcation and providing support at the junction. We estimate the remaining cost to complete the Petal bifurcation stent to be between $100 million and $125 million. We expect material net cash inflows from the Petal bifurcation stent to begin in 2011, which is when we expect the stent to be commercially available in the U.S. in a drug-eluting configuration. The AST Petal bifurcation stent in-process project is generally progressing in line with our estimates as of the acquisition date. In 2004, we recorded $65 million of purchased research and development. Our 2004 purchased research and development consisted primarily of $50 million relating to our acquisitions of Advanced Bionics and $14 million relating to our acquisition of Precision Vascular Systems, Inc. The most significant in-process projects acquired in connection with our 2004 acquisitions included Advanced Bionics’ bion® microstimulator and drug delivery pump, which collectively represented 77 percent of our 2004 acquired in-process projects’ value. The bion microstimulator is an implantable neurostimulation device designed to treat a variety of neurological conditions. We estimate the remaining cost to complete the bion microstimulator for migraine headaches to be approximately $35 million. We expect material net cash inflows from the bion microstimulator to commence in 2011, following its approval in the U.S., which we expect to occur in 2010. The Advanced Bionics drug delivery pump is an implanted programmable device designed to treat chronic pain. We estimate the remaining cost to complete the drug delivery pump to be between $50 million and $60 million. We continue to assess the pace and risk of development of the drug delivery pump, as well as general market opportunities for the pump, which may result in a delay in the timing of regulatory approval or lower potential market value. We currently expect material net cash inflows from the drug delivery pump to commence in 2012, following its approval in the U.S., which we expect to occur in 2011 or 2012. The estimated timing and costs to complete the bion microstimulator and the drug delivery pump have increased relative to what we estimated as of the acquisition date; however, we do not believe these increases will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following tables provide a summary of key performance indicators that we use to assess our liquidity and operating performance: 54 [Table of Contents] (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,668 $ 689 $ 1,296 Short-term marketable securities 159 344 Cash provided by operating activities 1,845 903 1,804 Cash used for investing activities 9,312 551 1,622 Cash provided by (used for) financing activities 8,439 (954 ) 439 EBITDA2 (2,273 ) 1,278 1,904 (in millions) 2006 2005 Short-term debt $ 7 $ 156 Long-term debt 8,895 1,864 Gross debt 8,902 2,020 Less: cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities 1,668 848 Net debt $ 7,234 $ 1,172 Management uses EBITDA to assess operating performance and believes that it may assist users of our financial statements in analyzing the underlying trends in our business over time. Users of our financial statements should consider this non-GAAP financial information in addition to, not as a substitute for, or as superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA included pre-tax charges of $4.715 billion in 2006, $1.112 billion in 2005 and $340 million in 2004; see the Executive Summary section for a description of these charges. Operating Activities Cash generated by our operating activities continues to be a major source of funds for servicing our outstanding debt obligations and investing in our growth. The increase in cash generated by our operating activities in 2006 as compared to 2005 is attributable primarily to significant one-time payments made during 2005, consisting of: an approximate $75 million settlement payment made to the Department of Justice; a one-time $110 million 401(k) contribution; a cash settlement with Medinol of $750 million; and tax payments, including those associated with the American Jobs Creation Act. Cash paid for income taxes and interest was $423 million in 2006 and $437 million in 2005. We expect to make approximately $400 million in tax payments during the first quarter of 2007 associated primarily with the gain on the sale of Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott. _____________________________ 2 The following represents a reconciliation between EBITDA and net (loss) income: (in millions) 2006 2005 2004 EBITDA $ (2,273 ) $ 1,278 $ 1,904 Interest income 67 36 20 Interest expense (435 ) (90 ) (64 ) Income taxes (42 ) (263 ) (432 ) Stock-based compensation expense (113 ) (19 ) (91 ) Depreciation and amortization (781 ) (314 ) (275 ) Net (loss) income $ (3,577 ) $ 628 $ 1,062 55 [Table of Contents] Investing Activities We made capital expenditures of $341 million in 2006 and 2005. Capital expenditures in 2006 included $107 million associated with our CRM and Cardiac Surgery divisions. Legacy Boston Scientific capital expenditures declined in 2006 compared to 2005 due to significant capital expenditures incurred in the prior year to enhance our manufacturing and distribution capabilities. We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $450 million during 2007, which includes a full year of capital expenditures for our CRM and Cardiac Surgery divisions; and capital expenditures to further upgrade our quality systems, to enhance our manufacturing capabilities in order to support a second drug-eluting stent platform, to facilitate the integration of Guidant and to support continuous growth in our business units, including our Neuromodulation division. Our investing activities during 2006 included: $15.4 billion of cash payments for our acquisition of Guidant, including approximately $100 million associated with the buyout of options of certain former Guidant vascular intervention and endovascular solutions employees in connection with the sale of these businesses to Abbott, and approximately $800 million of direct acquisition costs; $6.7 billion of cash acquired from Guidant, including proceeds of $4.1 billion from Guidant’s sale of its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott; $397 million in contingent payments associated primarily with Advanced Bionics, CryoVascular and Smart Therapeutics, Inc.; and $65 million of net payments for strategic alliances with both privately held and publicly traded entities. In January 2007, we acquired EndoTex, a developer of stents used in the treatment of stenotic lesions in the carotid arteries. In conjunction with the acquisition of EndoTex, we paid approximately $100 million, which included approximately five million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $90 million and cash of $10 million, in addition to our previous investments and notes issued of approximately $40 million, plus future consideration that is contingent upon EndoTex achieving certain performance-related milestones. We do not expect significant purchased research and development charges associated with this acquisition because EndoTex obtained FDA approval of its carotid stent system prior to acquisition. Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, payments for share repurchases and proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs. We had outstanding borrowings of $8.902 billion at December 31, 2006 at a weighted average interest rate of 6.03 percent as compared to outstanding borrowings of $2.02 billion at December 31, 2005 at a weighted average interest rate of 4.8 percent. During 2006, we received net proceeds from borrowings of $6.888 billion, which we used primarily to finance the cash portion of the Guidant acquisition. There were no amounts outstanding against our available credit lines of $2.35 billion at December 31, 2006. See Note F - Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for specific details regarding our 2006 and 2005 debt transactions. The debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our long-term debt as of December 31, 2006, is as follows: Payments Due by Period (in millions) 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Term loan $ 650 $ 650 $ 1,700 $ 2,000 $ 5,000 Abbott loan 900 900 Senior notes 850 $ 2,200 3,050 $ 650 $ 650 $ 1,700 $ 3,750 $ 2,200 $ 8,950 56 [Table of Contents] We expect to use a portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our outstanding debt obligations over the next several years. We will continue to examine all of our operations in order to identify cost improvement measures that will better align operating expenses with expected revenue levels and reallocate resources to better support growth initiatives. In addition, we have the flexibility to sell certain non-strategic assets and implement other strategic initiatives, which may generate proceeds that would be available for debt repayment. As of December 31, 2006, our credit ratings were BBB from Fitch Ratings; Baa3 from Moody’s Investor Service; and BBB from Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (S&P). These credit ratings are investment grade. The Moody’s and S&P ratings outlook is currently negative. Our revolving credit facility and term loan agreement requires that we maintain a ratio of debt to pro forma EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, of less than or equal to 4.5 to 1.0 through December 31, 2007 and 3.5 to 1.0 thereafter. The agreement also requires that we maintain a ratio of pro forma EBITDA, as defined by the agreement, to interest expense of greater than or equal to 3.0 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with both of these debt covenants. Exiting 2006, our ratio of debt to pro forma EBITDA was 3.6 to 1.0 and the ratio of pro forma EBITDA to interest expense was 5.6 to 1.0. Any breach of these covenants would require that we obtain waivers from our lenders and there can be no assurance that our lenders would grant such waivers. Our inability to obtain any necessary waivers, or to obtain them on reasonable terms, could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Equity In March 2006, we filed a new public registration statement with the SEC. During the first quarter of 2006, we increased our authorized common stock from 1.2 billion shares to 2.0 billion shares in anticipation of our acquisition of Guidant, and issued approximately 577 million shares to former Guidant shareholders in conjunction with the acquisition. In April 2006, we issued approximately 65 million shares of our common stock under this registration statement to Abbott for $1.4 billion. See Note D- Business Combinations to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details on the Guidant acquisition and Abbott transaction. During 2006, we received $145 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans as compared to $94 million in 2005. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees. We did not repurchase any of our common stock during 2006. We repurchased approximately 25 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $734 million in 2005, and 10 million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of $360 million in 2004. Since 1992, we have repurchased approximately 132 million shares of our common stock and we have approximately 12 million shares of our common stock held in treasury at year-end. Approximately 37 million shares remain under our previous share repurchase authorizations. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, which is in addition to our outstanding principal debt obligations as presented in the previous table. See Note D - Business Combinations, Note F - Borrowings and Credit Arrangements and Note H - Leases to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information 57 [Table of Contents] regarding our business combinations, debt obligations and lease arrangements. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, our consolidated balance sheets do not reflect the obligations below that relate to expenses incurred in future periods. Payments Due by Period (in millions) 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Operating leases $ 61 $ 47 $ 24 $ 11 $ 5 $ 36 $ 184 Purchase obligations† 182 1 1 1 185 Minimum royalty obligations 3 3 3 1 1 6 17 Interest payments†† 521 497 457 371 214 1,013 3,073 $ 767 $ 548 $ 485 $ 384 $ 220 $ 1,055 $ 3,459 † These obligations related primarily to inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. †† Interest payment amounts related to the $5.0 billion five-year term loan are projected using market interest rates as of December 31, 2006. Future interest payments may differ from these projections based on changes in the market interest rates. Certain of our business combinations involve the payment of contingent consideration. See Note D - Business Combinations to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with our business combinations. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, the acquired companies will reach their performance milestones or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues, the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above. Additionally, we may consider satisfying these commitments by issuing our stock or refinancing the commitments with cash, including cash obtained through the sale of our stock. Certain of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future or may require us to make payments that are contingent upon the company achieving certain product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, we will exercise our option to acquire these companies or be required to make these contingent payments, we have not included future potential payments relating to these equity investments in the table above. At December 31, 2006, we had outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately $90 million, which primarily consisted of financial lines of credit provided by banks and collateral for workers’ compensation programs. We enter these letters of credit and bank guarantees in the normal course of business. As of December 31, 2006, we have not drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees. At this time, we do not believe we will be required to fund any amounts from the guarantees or letters of credit and, accordingly, we have not recognized a related liability in our financial statements as of December 31, 2006. Our letters of credit and bank guarantees were immaterial at December 31, 2005. Critical Accounting Policies We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We describe these accounting polices in Note A—Significant Accounting Policies to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure 58 [Table of Contents] of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical (1) if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or (2) if materially different, estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas that we consider critical: Revenue Recognition Our revenue consists primarily of the sale of single-use medical devices. We consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. We generally meet these criteria at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor, unless a consignment arrangement exists. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, or implant, which indicates that the sale is complete. For all other transactions, we recognize revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfer to customers, provided there are no remaining substantive performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance. For multiple-element arrangements, whereby the sale of devices is combined with future service obligations, we defer revenue on the undelivered elements based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value. We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings. We establish a reserve for sales returns when the initial product is sold. We base our estimate for sales returns upon contractual commitments and historical trends and recorded such amount as a reduction to revenue. We offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. Inventory Reserves We base our provisions for excess, obsolete or expired inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales levels. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future. The industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all impact the estimates related to excess and obsolete inventory. Valuation of Business Combinations We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition. We then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets, including purchased research and development. 59 [Table of Contents] We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated cash flows and discount rates, and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations, purchased research and development charges, and intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods. The valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in-process projects. Our purchased research and development represents the value of in-process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. We expense the value attributable to these in-process projects at the time of the acquisition. If the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole. In addition, we record certain costs associated with our strategic alliances as purchased research and development. We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development. This approach determines fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among other factors: the in-process projects’ stage of completion; the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date; the costs already incurred; the projected costs to complete; the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets; the expected introduction date; and the estimated useful life of the technology. We base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors. For the in-process projects we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, we used the following ranges of risk-adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows: 13 percent to 17 percent in 2006, 18 percent to 27 percent in 2005, and 18 percent to 27 percent in 2004. We believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects. Impairment of Intangible Assets We review our intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life. In addition, we review our indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets. To test for impairment, we calculate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values. We test our March 31 goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment, or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the test, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The selection and use of an appropriate discount rate requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates. We have not recorded impairment of goodwill in any of the years included in our consolidated statements of operations. 60 [Table of Contents] Investments in Strategic Alliances We account for investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock. We account for investments in companies over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method. Our determination of whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an investment requires judgment. Factors that we consider in determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence include, but are not limited to: • our level of representation on the Board of Directors; • our participation in the investee’s policy-making processes; • transactions with the investee in the ordinary course of business; • interchange of managerial personnel; • the investee’s financial or technological dependency on us; and • our ownership in relation to the concentration of other shareholders. We regularly review our strategic alliance investments for impairment indicators. If we determine that impairment exists and it is other-than-temporary, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment’s carrying value and its fair value. Our exposure to loss related to our strategic alliances is generally limited to our equity investments and notes receivable associated with these alliances. See Note A - Significant Accounting Policies and Note C - Investments in Strategic Alliances to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a detailed analysis of our investments and our accounting treatment for our investment portfolio. Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse. We recognized net deferred tax liabilities of $2.201 billion at December 31, 2006 and $110 million at December 31, 2005. The liabilities relate primarily to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions. The assets relate primarily to the establishment of inventory and product-related reserves, litigation and product liability reserves, purchased research and development, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. In light of our historical financial performance, we believe we will substantially recover these assets. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years. We do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations. It is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested offshore are $7.186 billion at December 31, 2006 and $2.106 billion at December 31, 2005. We provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where 61 [Table of Contents] the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which we make such determination. See Note I — Income Taxes to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for a detailed analysis of our income tax accounting. Legal, Product Liability Costs and Securities Claims We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We are substantially self-insured with respect to general, product liability and securities claims and record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, loss for general product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $485 million at December 31, 2006 and $35 million at December 31, 2005. In connection with our acquisition of Guidant, the number of product liability claims and other legal proceedings filed against us, including private securities litigation and shareholder derivative suits, significantly increased. The amounts accrued at December 31, 2006 represent primarily accrued legal defense costs related to assumed Guidant litigation and product liability claims recorded as part of the purchase price. In connection with the acquisition of Guidant, we are still assessing certain assumed litigation and product liability claims to determine the amounts that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued in the future. See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Item 3. Legal Proceedings above and Note J — Commitments and Contingencies to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K. Stock-Based Compensation On January 1, 2006, we adopted FASB Statement No. 123(R), Share-Based Payment, which requires all share-based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values. We adopted Statement No. 123(R) using the “modified-prospective method” and have not restated prior period results of operations and financial position to reflect the impact of stock-based compensation expense under Statement No. 123(R). We use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to calculate the grant-date fair value of our stock options. We value restricted stock awards and deferred stock units based on the closing trading value of our shares on the date of grant. The following represents the assumptions used in calculating our stock-based compensation expense that require significant judgment by management: Expected Volatility - We have considered a number of factors in estimating volatility. For options granted prior to 2006, we used our historical volatility as a basis to estimate expected volatility in our valuation of stock options. We changed our method of estimating volatility upon the adoption of Statement No. 123(R). We now consider historical volatility, trends in volatility within our industry/peer group and implied volatility. Expected Term - We estimate the expected term of our options using historical exercise and forfeiture data. We believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of our new option grants. 62 [Table of Contents] Estimated Forfeiture Rate -We have applied, based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures, an annual forfeiture rate of eight percent to all unvested stock awards as of December 31, 2006, which represents the portion that we expect will be forfeited each year over the vesting period. We will reevaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary. Ultimately, we will only recognize expense for those shares that vest. See Note L - Stock Ownership Plans to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion regarding our adoption of Statement No. 123(R). New Accounting Standard In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes - an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. Interpretation No. 48 requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions, including a roll forward of tax benefits taken that do not qualify for financial statement recognition. We will record the cumulative effect of initially adopting Interpretation No. 48 as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adjustment and present such adjustment separately. Only tax positions that we are more likely than not to realize at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of Interpretation No. 48. We are required to adopt Interpretation No. 48 effective for our first quarter of 2007. We are currently in the process of assessing the impact of the new standard. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control system to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2006, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ James R. Tobin /s/ Lawrence C. Best President and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer 63 [Table of Contents] Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Board of Directors and Stockholders of Boston Scientific Corporation We have audited management’s assessment, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, that Boston Scientific Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management’s assessment and an opinion on the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating management’s assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, management’s assessment that Boston Scientific Corporation maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on the COSO criteria. Also, in our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2006, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2006 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 26, 2007, expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 26, 2007 64 [Table of Contents] ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flow are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty nonperformance on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by monitoring outstanding positions. Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third-party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $3.413 billion at December 31, 2006 and $3.593 billion at December 31, 2005. We recorded $71 million of other assets and $27 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments at December 31, 2006 as compared to $176 million of other assets and $55 million of other liabilities recorded at December 31, 2005. A 10 percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $112 million at December 31, 2006 and by $129 million at December 31, 2005. A 10 percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $134 million at December 31, 2006 and $157 million at December 31, 2005. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction. Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We use interest rate derivative instruments to manage the risk of interest rate changes either by converting floating-rate borrowings into fixed-rate borrowings or fixed-rate borrowings into floating-rate borrowings. We had interest rate derivative instruments outstanding in the notional amount of $2.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2005. The increase in the notional amount is due to $2.0 billion of hedge contracts related to our $5.0 billion five-year term loan, offset by our termination of $1.1 billion in hedge contracts related to certain of our existing senior notes. We recorded $11 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments at December 31, 2006 as compared to $21 million of other assets and $7 million of other liabilities recorded at December 31, 2005. A one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $26 million at December 31, 2006 as compared to a decrease of $74 million at December 31, 2005. A one percentage point decrease in interest rates would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $26 million at December 31, 2006 as compared to an increase of $80 million at December 31, 2005. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged interest payments related to the hedged term loan. At December 31, 2006, $5.886 billion, or 81 percent, of our approximately $7.234 billion in outstanding net debt is at fixed interest rates. See Note G - Financial Instruments to our 2006 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10-K for detailed information regarding our derivative financial instruments. 65 [Table of Contents]",2023-12-30 19:42:02.137559

885725,BSX,BOSTON SCIENTIFIC CORP,2009,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Introduction Boston Scientific Corporation is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of medical devices that are used in a broad range of interventional medical specialties. Our business strategy is to lead global markets for less-invasive medical devices by developing and delivering products and therapies that address unmet patient needs, provide superior clinical outcomes and demonstrate compelling economic value. We intend to achieve leadership, drive profitable sales growth and increase shareholder value by focusing on: • Customers • Innovation • Quality • People • Financial Strength In the first quarter of 2008, we completed the divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses. Our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 include a full year of results of these businesses. Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2008 include the results of these businesses through the date of separation. We are involved in several post-closing separation activities through transition service agreements, some from which we continue to generate net sales. These transition service agreements expire throughout 2009 and the first half of 2010. Refer to the Strategic Initiatives section and Note F – Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a description of these business divestitures. On April 21, 2006, we consummated the acquisition of Guidant Corporation. With this acquisition, we became a major provider in the cardiac rhythm management (CRM) market, enhancing our overall competitive position and long-term growth potential, and further diversifying our product portfolio. We also now share certain drug-eluting stent technology with Abbott Laboratories, which gives us access to a second drug-eluting stent program, and complements our TAXUS® stent system program. See Note D- Acquisitions to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further details on the Guidant acquisition and Abbott transaction. Our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 include a full year of results of our CRM business that we acquired from Guidant. Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2006 include the results of the CRM business beginning on the date of acquisition. We have included supplemental pro forma financial information in Note D – Acquisitions to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report which gives effect to the acquisition as though it had occurred at the beginning of 2006. Executive Summary Financial Highlights and Trends Net sales in 2008 were $8.050 billion, which included sales from divested businesses of $69 million, as compared to net sales of $8.357 billion in 2007, which included sales from divested business of $553 million, a decrease of $307 million or four percent. Foreign currency fluctuations increased our net sales by $213 million in 2008, as compared to 2007. Excluding the impact of foreign currency and sales from divested businesses, our net sales were flat with the prior year. Worldwide net sales of our CRM products increased eight percent in 2008, including an eight percent 39 increase in our U.S. CRM net sales and a seven percent increase in international CRM product net sales. These increases were driven by multiple product launches in both our U.S. and international markets, highlighted by the launch of our COGNIS® cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillator (CRT-D) system and our TELIGEN® implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) system. In addition, net sales from our Endosurgery businesses grew eight percent and our Neuromodulation division increased net sales by twenty percent in 2008, as compared to 2007. Partially offsetting these increases, was a decline in worldwide net sales from our Cardiovascular division of four percent during 2008, due principally to the impact of new competition in the U.S. drug-eluting stent market. However, we realized increased U.S. drug-eluting stent market share in the fourth quarter of 2008, as compared to the third quarter of 2008, and exited the year with an estimated 49 percent share of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market for the month of December. Our reported net loss for 2008 was $2.036 billion, or $1.36 per share, on approximately 1.5 billion weighted-average shares outstanding, as compared to a net loss for 2007 of $495 million, or $0.33 per share, also on 1.5 billion weighted-average shares outstanding. Our reported results for 2008 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and restructuring-related net charges; and discrete tax items of $2.796 billion (after-tax), or $1.87 per share, consisting of: • $2.756 billion ($2.790 billion pre-tax) of goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, associated primarily with a write-down of goodwill; • a $184 million gain ($250 million pre-tax) related to the receipt of an acquisition-related milestone payment from Abbott; • $44 million ($43 million pre-tax) of net purchased research and development charges, associated primarily with the acquisitions of Labcoat, Ltd. and CryoCor, Inc.; • $100 million of costs ($133 million pre-tax) associated with our on-going expense and head count reduction initiatives; • a $185 million gain ($250 million pre-tax), associated with the sale of certain non-strategic businesses; • $54 million of net losses ($80 million pre-tax) in connection with the sale of certain non-strategic investments; • $238 million of litigation-related charges ($334 million pre-tax) resulting primarily from a ruling by a federal judge in a patent infringement case brought against us by Johnson & Johnson; and • $27 million of discrete tax benefits related to certain tax positions associated with prior period acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and restructuring-related charges. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a $2.613 billion goodwill impairment charge associated with our acquisition of Guidant. The decline in our stock price and our market capitalization during the fourth quarter created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance; therefore, we performed an interim impairment test. Key factors contributing to the impairment charge included disruptions in the credit and equity markets, and the resulting impacts to weighted-average costs of capital, and changes in CRM market demand relative to our original assumptions at the time of acquisition. Refer to Note E – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. Our reported results for 2007 included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges and acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and restructuring-related charges of $1.110 billion (after-tax), or $0.74 per share. Refer to Liquidity and Capital Resources for a discussion of these charges. We continued to generate substantial cash flow during 2008. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.216 billion in 2008 as compared to $934 million in 2007. At December 31, 2008, we had total debt of $6.745 billion, cash and cash equivalents of $1.641 billion and working capital of $2.219 billion. During 2008, we prepaid $1.425 billion of debt under our term loan and our credit facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables and, in February 2009, prepaid an additional $500 million. As a result, our next scheduled debt maturity is $325 million due in April 2010. 40 Strategic Initiatives In 2007, we announced several new initiatives designed to enhance short- and long-term shareholder value, including the restructuring of several of our businesses and product franchises; the sale of non-strategic businesses and investments; and significant expense and head count reductions. Our goal was, and continues to be, to better align expenses with revenues, while preserving our ability to make needed investments in quality, research and development (R&D), capital improvements and our people that are essential to our long-term success. These initiatives have helped to provide better focus on our core businesses and priorities, which we believe will strengthen Boston Scientific for the future and position us for increased, sustainable and profitable sales growth. The execution of this plan enabled us to reduce R&D and selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately $500 million exiting 2008. Restructuring In October 2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count reduction plan, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 2,300 positions worldwide. We initiated activities under the plan in the fourth quarter of 2007 and expect to be substantially complete worldwide in 2010. Refer to Results of Operations and Note H – Restructuring-related Activities to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information on restructuring-related activities and estimated costs. Plant Network Optimization On January 27, 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a plant network optimization plan, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines from one facility to another and by closing certain facilities. The plan is a complement to our previously announced expense and head count reduction plan, and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins. Activities under the plan will be initiated in 2009 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2011. Refer to Results of Operations and Note H – Restructuring-related Activities to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information on restructuring-related activities and estimated costs. Divestitures During 2007, we determined that our Auditory, Vascular Surgery, Cardiac Surgery, Venous Access and Fluid Management businesses were no longer strategic to our on-going operations. Therefore, we initiated the process of selling these businesses in 2007, and completed their sale in the first quarter of 2008, as discussed below. We received pre-tax proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion from the sale of these businesses and our TriVascular Endovascular Aortic Repair (EVAR) program, and eliminated 2,000 positions in connection with these divestitures. In January 2008, we completed the sale of a controlling interest in our Auditory business and drug pump development program, acquired with Advanced Bionics Corporation in 2004, to entities affiliated with the principal former shareholders of Advanced Bionics for an aggregate purchase price of $150 million in cash. In connection with the sale, we recorded a loss of $367 million (pre-tax) in 2007, attributable primarily to the write-down of goodwill. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of $7 million during 2008 in connection with the closing of the transaction. Also in January 2008, we completed the sale of our Cardiac Surgery and Vascular Surgery businesses for net cash proceeds of approximately $700 million. In connection with the sale, we recorded a pre-tax loss of $193 million in 2007, representing primarily a write-down of goodwill. In addition, we recorded a tax expense of $19 million during 2008 in connection with the closing of the transaction. In February 2008, we completed the sale of our Fluid Management and Venous Access businesses for net cash proceeds of approximately $400 million. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $234 million ($161 million after-tax) during 2008 associated with this transaction. 41 Further, in March 2008, we sold our EVAR program obtained in connection with our 2005 acquisition of TriVascular, Inc. for $30 million in cash. We discontinued our EVAR program in 2006. In connection with the sale, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $16 million ($36 million after-tax) during 2008. During 2007, in connection with our strategic initiatives, we announced our intent to sell the majority of our investment portfolio in order to monetize those investments determined to be non-strategic. In June 2008, as part of our initiative to monetize non-strategic investments, we signed separate definitive agreements with Saints Capital and Paul Capital Partners to sell the majority of our investments in, and notes receivable from, certain publicly traded and privately held entities for gross proceeds of approximately $140 million. In connection with these agreements, we received proceeds of $95 million during 2008. In addition, we received $54 million of proceeds from other transactions to monetize certain other non-strategic investments and notes receivable. We recorded net pre-tax losses of approximately $80 million during 2008 related to these monetization initiatives and the write-down of certain non-strategic investments. We expect to receive $45 million of remaining proceeds from the Saints and Paul transactions during 2009, and do not expect to record significant gains or losses in 2009 related to these definitive agreements. Refer to our Other, net discussion, as well as Note G – Investments and Notes Receivable to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on our investment portfolio activity. Corporate Warning Letter In January 2006, legacy Boston Scientific received a corporate warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three of our facilities and advising us that our corporate-wide corrective action plan relating to three site-specific warning letters issued to us in 2005 was inadequate. We have identified solutions to the quality system issues cited by the FDA and have made significant progress in transitioning our organization to implement those solutions. During 2008, the FDA reinspected a number of our facilities and, in October 2008, informed us that our quality system is now in substantial compliance with its Quality System Regulations. The FDA has approved all of our requests for final approval of Class III product submissions previously on hold due to the corporate warning letter and has approved all currently eligible requests for Certificates to Foreign Governments (CFGs). Since October 2008, we have received approval to market the following new products in the U.S.: • our TAXUS® Express2® Atom™ paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system, designed for treating small coronary vessels; • our TAXUS® Liberté® paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system, our second-generation drug-eluting stent system; • our Carotid WALLSTENT® Monorail® Endoprosthesis, a less-invasive alternative to surgery for treating carotid artery disease; • our Apex™ Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA) dilatation catheter, for treating the most challenging atherosclerotic lesions; • our Express® SD Renal Monorail® stent system, the first low-profile, pre-mounted stent approved in the U.S. for use in renal arteries; and • our Sterling™ Monorail® and Over-the-Wire balloon dilatation catheter for use in the renal and lower extremity arteries. The FDA also approved the use of our TAXUS® Express2® paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system for the treatment of in-stent restenosis1 (ISR) in bare-metal stents, the first ISR approval granted by the FDA. The corporate warning letter remains in place pending final remediation of certain Medical Device Report (MDR) filing issues, which we are actively working with the FDA to resolve. This remediation has resulted and may continue to result in incremental medical device and vigilance reporting, which could adversely impact physician perception of our products. 1 In-stent restenosis is re-narrowing of the vessel inside a stent. 42 Business and Market Overview Cardiac Rhythm Management We estimate that the worldwide CRM market approximated $10.8 billion in 2008, as compared to approximately $10.0 billion in 2007, and estimate that U.S. ICD system sales represented approximately 40 percent of the worldwide CRM market in both years. Worldwide CRM market growth rates over the past three years, including the U.S. ICD market, have been below those experienced in prior years, resulting primarily from previous industry field actions and from a lack of new indications for use. In 2008, however, we began to see renewed growth of the worldwide CRM market with steadily increasing implant volumes. Net sales of our CRM products represented approximately 28 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2008 and 25 percent in 2007. The following are the components of our worldwide CRM product sales: (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2008 Year Ended December 31, 2007 U.S. International Total U.S. International Total ICD systems $ 1,140 $ 541 $ 1,681 $ 1,053 $ 489 $ 1,542 Pacemaker systems 340 265 605 318 264 582 $ 1,480 $ 806 $ 2,286 $ 1,371 $ 753 $ 2,124 Our U.S. sales of CRM products in 2008 increased $109 million, or eight percent, as compared to 2007. Our U.S. sales benefited from growth in the U.S. CRM market and from the successful launch of our next-generation COGNIS® CRT-D and TELIGEN® ICD systems, as well as the launches of our CONFIENT® ICD system, the LIVIAN® CRT-D system, and the ALTRUA™ family of pacemaker systems. We experienced ten percent growth in U.S. CRM sales during each of the second, third and fourth quarters of 2008, largely as a result of these new product launches. Our international CRM product sales increased $53 million, or seven percent in 2008, as compared to 2007, due primarily to an increase in the size of the international ICD market. However, our net sales and market share in Japan have been negatively impacted as we move to a direct sales model for our CRM products in Japan and, until we fully implement this model, our net sales and market share in Japan may continue to be negatively impacted. During 2008, we received more than a dozen new CRM product approvals. We will continue to execute on our product pipeline and expect to begin offering our LATITUDE® Patient Management System in certain European countries in 2009. This technology, which enables physicians to monitor device performance remotely while patients are in their homes, is a key component of many of our implantable device systems. We also plan to launch our next-generation pacemaker, the INGENIO™ pacemaker system, in the U.S., our EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa) region and certain Inter-Continental countries in the first half of 2011. We believe that these launches position us for sustainable growth within the worldwide CRM market. Net sales from our CRM products represent a significant source of our overall net sales. Therefore, increases or decreases in net sales from our CRM products could have a significant impact on our results of operations. While we believe that the size of the CRM market will increase above existing levels, there can be no assurance as to the timing or extent of this increase. We believe we are well positioned within the CRM market; however, the following variables may impact the size of the CRM market and/or our share of that market: • our continued ability to improve the trust and confidence of the implanting physician community, the referring physician community and prospective patients in our technology; • future product field actions or new physician advisories by us or our competitors; 43 • our ability to successfully launch next-generation products and technology; • the successful conclusion and positive outcomes of on-going clinical trials that may provide opportunities to expand indications for use; • variations in clinical results, reliability or product performance of our and our competitors’ products; • delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; • our ability to retain key members of our sales force and other key personnel; • new competitive launches; and • average selling prices and the overall number of procedures performed. Coronary Stents The size of the coronary stent market is driven primarily by the number of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures performed, as well as the percentage of those that are actually stented; the number of devices used per procedure; average drug-eluting stent selling prices; and the drug-eluting stent penetration rate (a measure of the mix between bare-metal and drug-eluting stents used across procedures). We estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market approximated $5.0 billion in 2008 and 2007, and estimate that drug-eluting stents represented approximately 80 percent of the dollar value of worldwide coronary stent market sales in both years. Uncertainty regarding the efficacy of drug-eluting stents, as well as the increased perceived risk of late stent thrombosis2 following the use of drug-eluting stents, contributed to a decline in the worldwide drug-eluting stent market size during 2006 and 2007. However, data addressing this risk and supporting the safety of drug-eluting stent systems positively affected trends in the growth of the drug-eluting stent market in 2008, as referring cardiologists regained confidence in this technology. Net sales of our coronary stent systems represented approximately 23 percent of our consolidated net sales for 2008 and 24 percent in 2007. We are the only company in the industry to offer a two-drug platform strategy with our TAXUS® paclitaxel-eluting stent system and the PROMUS® everolimus-eluting stent system. The following are the components of our worldwide coronary stent system sales: (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2008 Year Ended December 31, 2007 U.S. International Total U.S. International Total TAXUS® $ 621 $ 697 $ 1,318 $ 1,006 $ 754 $ 1,760 PROMUS® 212 104 316 28 28 Drug-eluting 833 801 1,634 1,006 782 1,788 Bare-metal 88 129 217 104 135 239 $ 921 $ 930 $ 1,851 $ 1,110 $ 917 $ 2,027 During 2008, U.S. sales of our drug-eluting stent systems declined $173 million, or 17 percent, due primarily to an increase in competition following recent competitive launches. We believe that our average share of the 2 Late stent thrombosis is the formation of a clot, or thrombus, within the stented area one year or more after implantation of the stent. 44 U.S. drug-eluting stent market declined to 46 percent during 2008, as compared to 55 percent in 2007. In addition, pricing pressure resulted in a reduction in the average selling price of our TAXUS® stent system in the U.S. by approximately five percent as compared to the prior year. However, increasing penetration rates have had a positive effect on the size of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market. Average drug-eluting stent penetration rates in the U.S. were 68 percent during 2008 (exiting 2008 at 73 percent for the month of December), as compared to 65 percent during 2007 (exiting 2007 at 62 percent for the month of December). We believe this is a strong indicator that the recovery of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market is continuing and the market is strengthening. In addition, the launch of our TAXUS® Express2® Atom™ and TAXUS® Liberté® stent systems in the U.S. during the fourth quarter of 2008 had a positive effect on our market share. We believe that exiting 2008, we were the market leader with 49 percent share of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market for the month of December, and are well positioned entering 2009. Our international drug-eluting stent system sales increased $19 million, or two percent, in 2008 as compared to 2007, due to a full year of drug-eluting stent sales in Japan and growth in the size of the international drug-eluting stent market as a result of increased PCI procedural volume and higher penetration rates. In May of 2007, we launched our TAXUS® Express2® coronary stent system in Japan, and, in January 2009, we received approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to market our second-generation TAXUS® Liberté® drug-eluting stent system in Japan. We are planning to launch our TAXUS® Liberté® stent system in Japan during the first quarter of 2009 and the PROMUS® everolimus-eluting coronary stent system in the second half of 2009, subject to regulatory approval. In July 2008, Abbott launched its XIENCE V™ everolimus-eluting coronary stent system, and, simultaneously, we launched the PROMUS® everolimus-eluting coronary stent system, supplied to us by Abbott. As of the closing of Abbott’s acquisition of Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, we obtained a perpetual license to use the intellectual property used in Guidant’s drug-eluting stent system program purchased by Abbott. We believe that being the only company to offer two distinct drug-eluting stent platforms provides us a considerable advantage in the drug-eluting stent market and has enabled us to sustain our worldwide leadership position. However, under the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit and operating profit margin of a PROMUS® stent system is significantly lower than that of our TAXUS® stent system. Our PROMUS® stent systems have operating profit margins that approximate half of our TAXUS® stent system operating profit margin. Therefore, if sales of our PROMUS® stent system continue to increase in relation to our total drug-eluting stent system sales, our profit margins will continue to decrease. Refer to our Gross Profit discussion for more information on the impact this sales mix has had on our gross profit margins. Further, the price we pay Abbott for our supply of PROMUS® stent systems is determined by our contracts with them. Our cost is based, in part, on previously fixed estimates of Abbott’s manufacturing costs for PROMUS® stent systems and third-party reports of our average selling price of PROMUS® stent systems. Amounts paid pursuant to this pricing arrangement are subject to a retroactive adjustment at pre-determined intervals based on Abbott’s actual costs to manufacture these stent systems for us and our average selling price of PROMUS® stent systems. During 2009, we may make a payment to or receive a payment from Abbott based on the differences between their actual manufacturing costs and the contractually stipulated manufacturing costs and differences between our actual average selling price and third-party reports of our average selling price, in each case, with respect to our purchases of PROMUS® stent systems from Abbott during 2008, 2007 and 2006. As a result, during 2009, our profit margins on the PROMUS® stent system may increase or decrease. We are reliant on Abbott for our supply of PROMUS® stent systems. Any production or capacity issues that affect Abbott’s manufacturing capabilities or the process for forecasting, ordering and receiving shipments may impact our ability to increase or decrease the level of supply to us in a timely manner; therefore, our supply of PROMUS® stent systems may not align with customer demand, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results. At present, we believe that our supply of PROMUS® stent systems from Abbott is sufficient to meet customer demand. Further, our supply agreement with Abbott for PROMUS® stent systems extends through the middle of the fourth quarter of 2009 in Europe, and is currently being reviewed by the European Commission for possible extension, and through the end of the second quarter of 2012 in the U.S. and Japan. We are incurring incremental costs and expending incremental resources in order to develop and commercialize an internally developed and manufactured next-generation everolimus-eluting stent system. We expect that this stent system, the PROMUS® Element™ stent system, will have gross profit margins more comparable to our TAXUS® stent system and will improve our overall 45 gross profit and operating profit margins once launched. We expect to launch PROMUS® Element in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries in late 2009 and in the U.S. and Japan in mid-2012. We expect to launch our first-generation PROMUS® everolimus-eluting coronary stent system during the second half of 2009 in Japan. Our product pipeline also includes the TAXUS® Element™ coronary stent system. We expect to launch our TAXUS® Element stent system in EMEA and certain Inter-Continental countries during the fourth quarter of 2009 and in the U.S. and Japan in mid-2011. Historically, the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs, patient populations and trial end points. Unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us, by our competitors or by third parties, or the market’s perception of these clinical data, may adversely impact our position in, and share of the drug-eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market. We believe that we can sustain our leadership position within the worldwide drug-eluting stent market for a variety of reasons, including: • our two drug-eluting stent platform strategy; • the broad and consistent long-term results of our TAXUS® clinical trials, and the favorable results of the XIENCE V™/PROMUS® stent system clinical trials to date; • the performance benefits of our current and future technology; • the strength of our pipeline of drug-eluting stent products; • our overall position in the worldwide interventional medicine market and our experienced interventional cardiology sales force; and • the strength of our clinical, marketing and manufacturing capabilities. However, a further decline in net sales from our drug-eluting stent systems could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and operating cash flows. The most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug-eluting stent market and our position within this market include: • our ability to successfully launch next-generation products and technology features; • physician and patient confidence in our technology and attitudes toward drug-eluting stents, including the continued abatement of prior concerns regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis; • changes in drug-eluting stent penetration rates, the overall number of PCI procedures performed, average number of stents used per procedure, and average selling prices of drug-eluting stent systems; • the outcome of intellectual property litigation; • variations in clinical results or perceived product performance of our or our competitors’ products; • delayed or limited regulatory approvals and unfavorable reimbursement policies; • our ability to retain key members of our sales force and other key personnel; and • changes in FDA clinical trial data and post-market surveillance requirements and the associated impact on new product launch schedules and the cost of product approvals and compliance. 46 There continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market. We are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings with certain of our existing competitors, including Johnson & Johnson, and other independent patent holders. There can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more proceedings would not materially impact our ability to meet our objectives in the coronary stent market, and our liquidity and results of operations. We previously had several active lawsuits pending between us and Medtronic, Inc. However, on January 23, 2009, we reached an agreement to stop all litigation between us and Medtronic with respect to interventional cardiology and endovascular repair cases. See Note L - Commitments and Contingencies to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a description of these legal proceedings. Other Businesses Interventional Cardiology (excluding coronary stent systems) In addition to coronary stent systems, our Interventional Cardiology business markets balloon catheters, rotational atherectomy systems, guide wires, guide catheters, embolic protection devices, and diagnostic catheters used in percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) procedures; and ultrasound and imaging systems. Our net sales of these products increased to $1.028 billion in 2008, as compared to $989 million in 2007, an increase of $39 million or four percent. This increase was driven primarily by growth in our ultrasound and imaging system franchise; including increased sales of our iLab® Ultrasound Imaging System, which enhances the diagnosis and treatment of blocked vessels and heart disorders. In addition, in November 2008, the FDA approved our Apex™ PTCA dilatation catheter, used in treating atherosclerotic lesions. Peripheral Interventions Our Peripheral Interventions business product offerings include stents, balloon catheters, sheaths, wires and vena cava filters, which are used to diagnose and treat peripheral vascular disease. Our 2008 net sales of these products decreased slightly to $589 million in 2008, as compared to $597 million in 2007. The decrease was a result of U.S. sales declines of $34 million in 2008 to $294 million, from $328 million in 2007, primarily as a result of increased competition across most of the vascular interventional product categories. Our international Peripheral Interventions business grew $26 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, due primarily to foreign currency fluctuations. We continue to hold a strong worldwide position in the Peripheral Interventions market and we are the market leader in multiple product categories. Further, in the fourth quarter of 2008, we received FDA approval for three new products: our Carotid WALLSTENT® Monorail® Endoprosthesis for the treatment of patients with carotid artery disease who are at high risk for surgery; our Express® SD Renal Monorail® premounted stent system for use as an adjunct to percutaneous transluminal renal angioplasty in certain lesions of the renal arteries; and our Sterling™ Monorail® and Over-the-Wire balloon dilatation catheter for use in the renal and lower extremity arteries. Neurovascular We market a broad line of products used in treating diseases of the neurovascular system. Our Neurovascular net sales increased to $360 million in 2008, as compared to $352 million in 2007, an increase of $8 million or two percent. Our U.S. net sales were $131 million in 2008, as compared to $127 million in 2007, and our international net sales were $229 million in 2008, as compared to $225 million in 2007. We plan to launch a next-generation family of detachable coils, including an enhanced delivery system with reduced coil detachment times, in the U.S. in the second half of 2009. Within our product pipeline, we are also developing next-generation technologies for the treatment of aneurysms, intracranial atherosclerotic disease and acute ischemic stroke, and are involved in numerous clinical activities that are designed to expand the size of the worldwide Neurovascular market. 47 Endosurgery Our Endosurgery group develops and manufactures devices to treat a variety of medical conditions, including diseases of the digestive and pulmonary systems within our Endoscopy division, and urological and gynecological disorders within our Urology division. Our Endosurgery group net sales grew eight percent in 2008 to $1.374 billion, and accounted for 17 percent of our total net sales in 2008, as compared to 15 percent in 2007. The following are the components of our worldwide Endosurgery business: (in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2008 Year Ended December 31, 2007 U.S. International Total U.S. International Total Endoscopy $ 477 $ 466 $ 943 $ 453 $ 413 $ 866 Urology 335 96 431 316 87 403 $ 812 $ 562 $ 1,374 $ 769 $ 500 $ 1,269 Our Endoscopy net sales grew nine percent in 2008 to $943 million from $866 million in 2007. Key sales growth drivers within Endoscopy included our biliary franchise, which grew $45 million, or 16 percent, to $324 million on the strength of our SpyGlass® Direct Visualization System for single-operator duodenoscope assisted cholangiopancreatoscopy, or visual examination of the bile ducts, which was launched in the second quarter of 2007. In addition, our hemostasis franchise grew $16 million, or 18 percent, to $107 million on the strength of our Resolution® Clip Device, which is the only currently-marketed mechanical clip designed to open and close (up to five times) before deployment to enable a physician to see the effects of the clip before committing to deployment. Our Urology net sales grew seven percent in 2008 to $431 million from $403 million in 2007. This growth was primarily due to our pelvic floor franchise, which grew 17 percent, or $14 million, to $95 million, led by our line of sling-based devices and kits, which are used in the treatment of a variety of stress- and age-related disorders of the lower female anatomy. The remaining Urology growth was spread across the other components of our business, including our stone management and gynecology franchises. During 2009, we intend to launch a number of new products across multiple franchises in both our Endoscopy and Urology businesses. Neuromodulation Despite new product launches during the year by both of our major competitors, our Neuromodulation net sales increased to $245 million in 2008, as compared to $204 million in 2007, an increase of $41 million or 20 percent. Our U.S. net sales were $234 million in 2008, as compared to $198 million in 2007, and our international net sales were $11 million in 2008, as compared to $6 million in 2007. We continued to maintain our strong position within the U.S. market with our Precision® Spinal Cord Stimulation (SCS) system, used for the treatment of chronic pain of the lower back and legs. We believe that we continue to have a technology advantage over our competitors with proprietary features such as Multiple Independent Current Control, which allows the physician to target specific areas of pain more precisely. In addition, we are currently assessing the use of our SCS system to treat other sources of pain. These factors, coupled with the move of our Neuromodulation business to a new state-of-the-art facility during 2008, position us well for continued growth in this market. Innovation Our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through strategic acquisitions and alliances. Our research and development efforts are focused largely on the development of next-generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and 48 divisions. We expect to continue to invest in our CRM and drug-eluting stent technologies, and will also invest selectively in areas outside of these markets. We expect to continue to invest in our paclitaxel drug-eluting stent program, along with our internally developed and manufactured everolimus-eluting stent program (the PROMUS® Element™ stent system), to sustain our leadership position in the worldwide drug-eluting stent market. There can be no assurance that these technologies will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approvals or gain market acceptance. A delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our future growth. Our strategic acquisitions are intended to expand further our ability to offer our customers safe, effective, high-quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs. Management believes it has developed a sound plan to integrate acquired businesses. However, our failure to integrate these businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic and financial objectives of these transactions. Potential future acquisitions may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing, depending on their size and nature. We have entered strategic alliances with both publicly traded and privately held companies. We enter these alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets. During 2008, we monetized certain investments and alliances no longer determined to be strategic (see the Strategic Initiatives section for more information). While we believe our remaining strategic investments are within attractive markets with an outlook for sustained growth, the full benefit of these alliances is highly dependent on the strength of the other companies’ underlying technology and ability to execute. An inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings, or litigation related to these technologies, among other factors, may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these strategic alliances. Reimbursement and Funding Our products are purchased principally by hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers worldwide that typically bill various third-party payors, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed-care programs for the healthcare services provided to their patients. Third-party payors may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on independently determined assessment criteria. Reimbursement by third-party payors for these services is based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services’ assessed resource costs, clinical outcomes and economic value. These reimbursement methodologies confer different, and sometimes conflicting, levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients, and these methodologies are subject to frequent refinements. Third-party payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. There can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by third-party payors, that reimbursement will be available or, if available, that the third-party payors’ coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably. Accordingly, the outcome of these reimbursement decisions could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, the current economic climate may impose further pressure on funds available for reimbursement of healthcare and on reimbursement levels. Manufacturing and Raw Materials We design and manufacture the majority of our products in technology centers around the world. Many components used in the manufacture of our products are readily fabricated from commonly available raw materials or off-the-shelf items available from multiple supply sources. Certain items are custom made to meet our specifications. We believe that in most cases, redundant capacity exists at our suppliers and that alternative sources of supply are available or could be developed within a reasonable period of time. We also have an on-going program to identify single-source components and to develop alternative back-up supplies. However, in certain cases, we may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers for specific components or materials, largely due to the regulatory approval system and the complex nature of our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers. A reduction or interruption in supply, an inability to 49 develop and validate alternative sources if required, or a significant increase in the price of raw materials or components could adversely affect our operations and financial condition, particularly materials or components related to our CRM products and drug-eluting stent systems. In addition, our products require sterilization prior to sale and we rely primarily on third party vendors to perform this service. To the extent our third party sterilizers are unable to process our products, whether due to raw material, capacity, regulatory or other constraints, we may be unable to transition to other providers in a timely manner, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. International Markets Our profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions, currency fluctuations, regulatory and reimbursement approvals, competitive offerings, infrastructure development, rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy. Any significant changes in the competitive, political, regulatory, reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. International markets, including Japan, are affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs. Initiatives to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, are under way in many countries in which we do business. Implementation of cost containment initiatives and healthcare reforms in significant markets such as Japan, Europe and other international markets may limit the price of, or the level at which reimbursement is provided for, our products and may influence a physician’s selection of products used to treat patients. We expect these practices to put increased pressure on reimbursement rates in these markets. In addition, most international jurisdictions have adopted regulatory approval and periodic renewal requirements for medical devices, and we must comply with these requirements in order to market our products in these jurisdictions. Further, some emerging markets rely on the FDA’s CFGs in lieu of their own regulatory approval requirements. Although the corporate warning letter has not been formally resolved, the FDA has approved all currently eligible requests for CFGs. However, any limits on our ability to market our full line of existing products and to launch new products within these jurisdictions could have an adverse impact on our business.

To calculate net sales growth rates that exclude the impact of currency exchange, we convert actual current period net sales from local currency to U.S. dollars using constant currency exchange rates. The regional constant currency growth rates in the table above can be recalculated from our net sales by reportable segment as presented in Note P – Segment Reporting to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Growth rates are based on actual, non-rounded amounts and may not recalculate precisely. U.S. Net Sales Our U.S. net sales, excluding sales from divested businesses, decreased $35 million, or one percent in 2008, as compared to 2007. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in Cardiovascular division sales of $222 million, driven primarily by declines in sales of our drug-eluting stent systems due to increased competition. Partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in CRM product sales of $109 million, as a result of numerous successful product launches during the year. In addition, U.S. sales in our Endosurgery division grew $43 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, driven by strength in our biliary and hemostasis franchises, and our Neuromodulation division increased sales by $36 million, due to market growth and continued physician adoption of our Precision Plus™ spinal cord stimulation technology. Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for a more detailed discussion of our net sales by division. Our U.S. net sales, excluding sales from divested businesses, increased $107 million, or two percent, in 2007, as compared to 2006. The increase related primarily to an increase in U.S. CRM product sales of approximately $450 million due to a full year of consolidated operations in 2007. In addition, we achieved year-over-year U.S. sales growth of approximately $60 million in our Endosurgery businesses and $65 million in our Neuromodulation business. Offsetting these increases was a decline in our U.S. Cardiovascular division sales of approximately $500 million, driven primarily by lower sales of our TAXUS® drug-eluting stent system as a result of a decrease in the size of the U.S. drug-eluting stent market. This decrease was driven principally by declines in drug-eluting stent penetration rates resulting from on-going concerns regarding the safety and efficacy of drug-eluting stents. 51 International Net Sales Our international net sales, excluding sales from divested businesses, increased $212 million, or six percent, in 2008, as compared to 2007. The increase was attributable primarily to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates, which contributed $208 million to our international net sales, excluding sales from divested businesses. Within our international business, sales in our Cardiovascular division increased $77 million and CRM product sales increased $53 million. In addition, sales in our Endosurgery franchises increased $63 million in 2008, as compared to 2007. Refer to the Business and Market Overview section for a more detailed discussion of our net sales by division. Our international net sales, excluding sales from divested businesses, increased $352 million, or 12 percent, in 2007 as compared to 2006. Approximately $170 million was attributable to the favorable impact of currency exchange rates. Within our international business, sales of our CRM products increased $290 million, due primarily to a full year of consolidated results in 2007. Sales in our Cardiovascular division increased $50 million, due primarily to the May 2007 launch of our TAXUS® Express2® coronary stent system in Japan. Gross Profit In 2008, our gross profit was $5.581 billion, as compared to $6.015 billion in 2007, a decrease of $434 million or seven percent. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit decreased to 69.3 percent for 2008, as compared to 72.0 percent for 2007. For 2007, our gross profit was $6.015 billion, as compared to $5.614 billion for 2006. As a percentage of net sales, our gross profit increased slightly to 72.0 percent in 2007, as compared to 71.8 percent in 2006. The following is a reconciliation of our gross profit percentages from 2006 to 2007 and 2007 to 2008: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Gross profit - prior year 72.0 % 71.8 % Shifts in product sales mix (2.5 ) % (1.8 ) % Lower Project Horizion spend 0.7 % 0.2 % Impact of higher inventory charges and other period expenses (0.5 ) % (1.0 ) % Inventory step up charge in 2006 3.4 % All other (0.4 ) % (0.6 ) % Gross profit - current year 69.3 % 72.0 % The primary factor contributing to a shift in product sales mix toward lower margin products in both years was a decrease in sales of our higher margin TAXUS® drug-eluting stent system. The shift in sales away from TAXUS® stent systems during 2008 was primarily due to increased sales of PROMUS® stent systems in the U.S., following its July 2008 approval and launch. Under the terms of our supply arrangement with Abbott, the gross profit margin of a PROMUS® stent system is significantly lower than that of our TAXUS® stent system. In 2008, sales of our PROMUS® stent system represented 19 percent of our worldwide drug-eluting stent system sales, as compared to two percent in 2007. Our gross profit margin was also negatively impacted by higher inventory charges and other period expenses during both years. In 2008, these charges consisted primarily of a $23 million inventory write-off related to an FDA warning letter received by one of our third party sterilizers, and approximately $20 million of CRM-related inventory write-offs, resulting principally from the successful launch of COGNIS® and TELIGEN®. In 2007, these charges included warranty-related and other scrap charges. Partially offsetting these declines in our gross profit margin was lower spending associated with Project Horizon, our corporate-wide initiative to improve and harmonize our overall quality processes and systems, which ended as a formal program as of December 31, 2007. In addition, included in cost of products sold for 2006 was an adjustment of $267 million, representing the step-up value of acquired Guidant inventory sold 52 during the year. There were no amounts included in our 2007 or 2008 cost of products sold related to the inventory step-up and, as of December 31, 2007, we had no step-up value remaining in inventory. Operating Expenses The following table provides a summary of certain of our operating expenses: 2008 2007 2006 (in millions) $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales $ % of Net Sales Selling, general and administrative expenses 2,589 32.2 2,909 34.8 2,675 34.2 Research and development expenses 1,006 12.5 1,091 13.1 1,008 12.9 Royalty expense 203 2.5 202 2.4 231 3.0 Amortization expense 543 6.7 620 7.4 474 6.1 Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) Expenses In 2008, our SG&A expenses decreased by $320 million, or 11 percent, as compared to 2007. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses decreased to 32.2 percent in 2008 from 34.8 percent in 2007. The decrease in our SG&A expenses related primarily to lower head count and spending resulting from our expense and head count reduction plan, as well as a reduction of $160 million attributable to our first quarter 2008 divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses. Refer to the Strategic Initiatives section for more discussion of these initiatives. In 2007, our SG&A expenses increased by $234 million, or nine percent, as compared to 2006. As a percentage of our net sales, SG&A expenses increased slightly to 34.8 percent in 2007 from 34.2 percent in 2006. The increase in our SG&A expenses related primarily to $256 million in incremental SG&A expenditures associated with a full year of consolidated CRM operations, offset partially by lower head count and spending as a result of our expense and head count reduction plan, which was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2007. Research and Development (R&D) Expenses Our investment in R&D reflects spending on new product development programs, as well as regulatory compliance and clinical research. In 2008, our R&D expenses decreased by $85 million, or eight percent, as compared to 2007. As a percentage of our net sales, R&D expenses decreased to 12.5 percent in 2008 from 13.1 percent in 2007. The decrease related primarily to lower head count and spending of $75 million resulting from our first quarter 2008 divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses. We remain committed to advancing medical technologies and investing in meaningful research and development projects in all of our businesses in order to maintain a healthy pipeline of new products that will contribute to our short- and long-term profitable sales growth. In 2007, our R&D expenses increased by $83 million, or 8 percent, as compared to 2006. As a percentage of our net sales, R&D expenses increased marginally to 13.1 percent in 2007 from 12.9 percent in 2006. The increase related primarily to $131 million in incremental R&D expenditures associated with a full year of consolidated CRM operations, offset partially by lower spending of approximately $37 million associated with the cancellation of our Endovations™ single-use endoscope R&D program. During the second quarter of 2007, we determined that our Endovations system would not be a commercially viable product and terminated the program. In addition, our 2006 R&D expenses included approximately $30 million in costs related to the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA stent-graft program. We do not expect these program cancellations to materially impact our future operations or cash flows. 53 Royalty Expense In 2008, our royalty expense increased by $1 million, or less than one percent, as compared to 2007. As a percentage of our net sales, royalty expense increased slightly to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent for 2007. Royalty expense attributable to sales of our drug-eluting stent systems increased $8 million as compared to 2007, despite an overall decrease in drug-eluting stent system sales. This was due to a shift in the mix of our drug-eluting stent system sales towards the PROMUS® stent system, following its launch in 2008. The royalty rate applied to sales of the PROMUS® stent system is, on average, higher than that associated with sales of our TAXUS® stent system. Offsetting this increase was a decrease in royalty expense of $6 million attributable to our first quarter 2008 divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses. In 2007, our royalty expense decreased by $29 million, or 13 percent, as compared to 2006, due primarily to lower sales of our TAXUS® drug-eluting stent system. As a percentage of our net sales, royalty expense decreased to 2.4 percent from 3.0 percent for 2006. Royalty expense attributable to sales of our TAXUS® stent system decreased $48 million as compared to 2006, due to a decrease in TAXUS® stent system sales. Offsetting this decrease was an increase in royalty expense attributable to Guidant-related products of $13 million, due to a full year of consolidated results, as well as increases in royalties associated with our other businesses. Amortization Expense In 2008, our amortization expense decreased by $77 million, or 12 percent, as compared to 2007. The decrease in our amortization expense related primarily to the disposal of $581 million of amortizable intangible assets in connection with our first quarter 2008 business divestitures, and to certain Interventional Cardiology-related intangible assets reaching the end of their accounting useful life during 2008. In 2007, our amortization expense increased by $146 million, or 31 percent, as compared to 2006. The increase in our amortization expense related to incremental amortization associated with intangible assets obtained as part of the Guidant acquisition, due to a full year of amortization. Goodwill and Intangible Asset Impairment Charges In 2008, we recorded goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges of $2.790 billion, including a $2.613 billion write-down of goodwill associated with our acquisition of Guidant, a $131 million write-down of certain of our Peripheral Interventions-related intangible assets, and a $46 million write-down of certain Urology-related intangible assets. We do not believe that the write-down of these assets will have a material impact on future operations or cash flows. Refer to Note E –Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. In 2007, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $21 million associated with our acquisition of Advanced Stent Technologies (AST), due to our decision to suspend further significant funding of R&D with respect to the Petal™ bifurcation stent. We do not expect this decision to materially impact our future operations or cash flows. In 2006, we recorded intangible asset impairment charges of $23 million attributable to the cancellation of the AAA stent-graft program we acquired with TriVascular, Inc. In addition, we recorded intangible asset write-offs of $21 million associated with developed technology obtained as part of our 2005 acquisition of Rubicon Medical Corporation, and $12 million associated with our Real-time Position Management® System (RPM)™ technology, due to our decision to cease investment in these technologies. We do not expect these decisions to materially impact our future operations or cash flows. Acquisition-related Milestone In connection with Abbott‘s 2006 acquisition of Guidant’s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses, Abbott agreed to pay us a milestone payment of $250 million upon receipt of FDA approval to sell an everolimus-eluting stent in the U.S. In July 2008, Abbott received FDA approval and launched its 54 XIENCE V™ everolimus-eluting coronary stent system in the U.S., and paid us $250 million, which we recorded as a gain in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Under the terms of the agreement, we are entitled to receive a second milestone payment of $250 million from Abbott upon receipt of an approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to market the XIENCE V™ stent system in Japan. Purchased Research and Development In 2008, we recorded $43 million of purchased research and development charges, including $17 million associated with our acquisition of Labcoat, Ltd., $8 million attributable to our acquisition of CryoCor, Inc., and $18 million associated with entering certain licensing and development arrangements. The $17 million of in-process research and development associated with our acquisition of Labcoat, Ltd. relates to a novel technology Labcoat is developing for coating drug-eluting stents. We intend to use this technology in future generations of our drug-eluting stent products. The $8 million of in-process research and development associated with CryoCor represents cryogenic technology for use in the treatment of atrial fibrillation, the most common and difficult to treat cardiac arrhythmia (abnormal heartbeat). We intend to use this technology in order to further pursue therapeutic solutions for atrial fibrillation and advance our existing CRM and Electrophysiology product lines. In 2007, we recorded $85 million of purchased research and development, including $75 million associated with our acquisition of Remon Medical Technologies, Inc., $13 million resulting from the application of equity method accounting for one of our strategic investments, and $12 million associated with payments made for certain early-stage CRM technologies. Additionally, in June 2007, we terminated our product development agreement with Aspect Medical Systems relating to brain monitoring technology that Aspect was developing to aid the diagnosis and treatment of depression, Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological conditions. As a result, we recognized a credit to purchased research and development of approximately $15 million during 2007, representing future payments that we would have been obligated to make prior to the termination of the agreement. We do not expect the termination of the agreement to impact our future operations or cash flows materially. The $75 million of in-process research and development acquired with Remon consists of a pressure-sensing system development project, which we intend to combine with our existing CRM devices. As of December 31, 2008, we estimate that the total cost to complete the development project is between $75 million and $80 million. We expect to launch devices using pressure-sensing technology in 2012 in our EMEA region and certain Inter-Continental countries, in the U.S. in 2015, and Japan in 2016, subject to regulatory approvals. We expect material net cash inflows from such products to commence in 2015, following the launch of this technology in the U.S. In 2006, we recorded $4.119 billion of purchased research and development, including a charge of approximately $4.169 billion associated with the in-process research and development obtained in conjunction with the Guidant acquisition; a credit of $67 million resulting primarily from the reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the TriVascular AAA program; and an expense of $17 million resulting primarily from the application of equity method accounting for one of our investments. The $4.169 billion of purchased research and development associated with the Guidant acquisition consists primarily of approximately $3.26 billion for acquired CRM-related in-process technology and $540 million for drug-eluting stent technology shared with Abbott. The purchased research and development value associated with the Guidant acquisition also includes $369 million representing the estimated fair value of the potential milestone payments of up to $500 million that we may receive from Abbott upon their receipt of regulatory approvals for certain products. We recorded the amounts as purchased research and development at the acquisition date because the receipt of the payments was dependent on future research and development activity and regulatory approvals, and the asset had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date. In 2008, Abbott received FDA approval and launched its XIENCE V™ everolimus-eluting 55 coronary stent system in the U.S., and paid us $250 million, which we recognized as a gain in our consolidated financial statements. Under the terms of the agreement, we are entitled to receive a second milestone payment of $250 million from Abbott upon receipt of an approval from the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare to market the XIENCE V™ stent system in Japan. If received, we will record this receipt as a gain in our consolidated financial statements at the time of receipt. The most significant in-process purchased research and development projects acquired from Guidant included the next-generation CRM pulse generator platform and rights to the everolimus-eluting stent technology that we share with Abbott. The next-generation pulse generator platform incorporates new components and software while leveraging certain existing intellectual property, technology, manufacturing know-how and institutional knowledge of Guidant. We expect to leverage this platform across all CRM product families, including ICD systems, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices and pacemaker systems to treat electrical dysfunction in the heart. During 2008, we substantially completed the in-process CRM pulse generator project with the regulatory approval and launch of the COGNIS® CRT-D and TELIGEN® ICD devices in the U.S., EMEA, and certain Inter-Continental countries. We expect to launch the INGENIO™ pacemaker system, utilizing this platform in both EMEA and the U.S. in the first half of 2011. As of December 31, 2008, we estimate that the total cost to complete the INGENIO™ technology is between $30 million and $35 million and expect material net cash inflows from the INGENIO™ device to commence in the second half of 2011. The $540 million attributable to everolimus-eluting stent technology represents the estimated fair value of the rights to Guidant’s everolimus-based drug-eluting stent technology we share with Abbott. In December 2006, we launched the PROMUS® everolimus-eluting coronary stent system, supplied to us by Abbott, in certain EMEA countries. In 2007, we expanded our launch in EMEA, as well as certain Inter-Continental countries and, in July 2008, launched in the U.S. We expect to launch an internally developed and manufactured next-generation everolimus-based stent, our PROMUS® Element™ stent system, in Europe in late 2009 and in the U.S. and Japan in mid-2012. We expect that net cash inflows from our internally developed and manufactured everolimus-based drug-eluting stent will commence in 2010. As of December 31, 2008, we estimate that the cost to complete our internally manufactured next-generation everolimus-eluting stent technology project is between $150 million and $175 million. Gain on Divestitures During 2008, we recorded a $250 million gain in connection with the sale of our Fluid Management and Venous Access businesses and our TriVascular EVAR program. Refer to the Strategic Initiatives section and Note F – Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these transactions. Loss on Assets Held for Sale During 2007, we recorded a $560 million loss attributable primarily to the write-down of goodwill in connection with the sale of certain of our non-strategic businesses. Refer to the Strategic Initiatives section and Note F – Divestitures and Assets Held for Sale to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these transactions. Restructuring In October 2007, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, an expense and head count reduction plan, which resulted in the elimination of approximately 2,300 positions worldwide. We are 56 providing affected employees with severance packages, outplacement services and other appropriate assistance and support. The plan is intended to bring expenses in line with revenues as part of our initiatives to enhance short- and long-term shareholder value. Key activities under the plan include the restructuring of several businesses, corporate functions and product franchises in order to better utilize resources, strengthen competitive positions, and create a more simplified and efficient business model; the elimination, suspension or reduction of spending on certain R&D projects; and the transfer of certain production lines from one facility to another. We initiated these activities in the fourth quarter of 2007 and expect to be substantially complete worldwide in 2010. We expect that the execution of this plan will result in total pre-tax expenses of approximately $425 million to $450 million. We are recording a portion of these expenses as restructuring charges and the remaining portion through other lines within our consolidated statements of operations. We expect the plan to result in cash payments of approximately $395 million to $415 million. The following provides a summary of our expected total costs associated with the plan by major type of cost: Type of cost Total estimated amount expected to be incurred Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $225 million to $230 million Fixed asset write-offs $20 million Other (1) $65 million to $70 million Restructuring-related expenses: Retention incentives $75 million to $80 million Accelerated depreciation $10 million to $15 million Transfer costs (2) $30 million to $35 million $425 million to $450 million (1) Consists primarily of consulting fees and contractual cancellations. (2) Consists primarily of costs to transfer product lines from one facility to another, including costs of transfer teams, freight and product line validations. During 2008, we recorded $78 million of restructuring charges. In addition, we recorded $55 million of expenses within other lines of our consolidated statements of operations related to our restructuring initiatives. The following presents these costs by major type and line item within our consolidated statements of operations: (in millions) Termination Benefits Retention Incentives Asset Write-offs Accelerated Depreciation Transfer Costs Other Total Restructuring charges $ 34 $ 10 $ 34 $ 78 Restructuring-related expenses: Cost of products sold $ 9 $ 4 $ 4 17 Selling, general and administrative expenses 27 4 31 Research and development expenses 7 7 43 8 4 55 $ 34 $ 43 $ 10 $ 8 $ 4 $ 34 $ 133 During 2007, we recorded $176 million of restructuring charges, and $8 million of restructuring-related expenses within other lines of our consolidated statements of operations. The following presents these costs by major type and line item within our consolidated statements of operations: 57 (in millions) Termination Benefits Retention Incentives Asset Write-offs Accelerated Depreciation Transfer Costs Other Total Restructuring charges $ 158 $ 8 $ 10 $ 176 Restructuring-related expenses: Cost of products sold $ 1 $ 1 2 Selling, general and administrative expenses 2 $ 2 4 Research and development expenses 2 2 5 3 8 $ 158 $ 5 $ 8 $ 3 $ 10 $ 184 The termination benefits recorded during 2008 and 2007 represent amounts incurred pursuant to our on-going benefit arrangements and amounts for “one-time” involuntary termination benefits, and have been recorded in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statement No. 112, Employer’s Accounting for Postemployment Benefits and FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. We expect to record the additional termination benefits in 2009 when we identify with more specificity the job classifications, functions and locations of the remaining head count to be eliminated. Retention incentives represent cash incentives, which are being recorded over the future service period during which eligible employees must remain employed with us in order to retain the payment. The other restructuring costs, which, in 2008 and 2007, represented primarily consulting fees, are being recognized and measured at their fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred in accordance with FASB Statement No. 146. We have incurred cumulative restructuring and restructuring-related costs of $317 million since we committed to the plan in October 2007. The following presents these costs by major type (in millions): Termination benefits $ 192 Retention incentives 48 Fixed asset write-offs 18 Accelerated depreciation 11 Transfer costs 4 Other 44 $ 317 In 2008, we made cash payments of approximately $185 million associated with our restructuring initiatives, which related to termination benefits and retention incentives paid and other restructuring charges. We have made cumulative cash payments of approximately $230 million since we committed to our restructuring initiatives in October 2007. These payments were made using cash generated from our operations. We expect to record the remaining costs associated with these restructuring initiatives during 2009 and make the remaining cash payments throughout 2009 and 2010 using cash generated from operations. As a result of our restructuring- and divestiture-related initiatives, we have reduced our R&D and SG&A expenses by an annualized run rate of approximately $500 million exiting 2008. In addition, we expect annualized run-rate reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $35 million to $40 million, as a result of our transfers of production lines. Due to the longer-term nature of these initiatives, we do not expect to achieve the full benefit of these reductions in manufacturing costs until 2012. We have partially reinvested our savings from our head count reductions into targeted head count increases of 500 positions, primarily in direct sales, to drive sales growth. Plant Network Optimization On January 27, 2009, our Board of Directors approved, and we committed to, a plant network optimization plan, which is intended to simplify our manufacturing plant structure by transferring certain production lines from one facility to another and by closing certain facilities. The plan is a complement to our previously 58 announced expense and head count reduction plan, and is intended to improve overall gross profit margins. Activities under the plan will be initiated in 2009 and are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2011. We estimate that the plan will result in annual reductions of manufacturing costs of approximately $65 million to $80 million in 2012. These savings are in addition to the estimated $35 million to $40 million of annual reductions of manufacturing costs in 2012 from activities under our previously announced expense and head count reduction plan. We estimate that the plan will result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $135 million to $150 million, and that approximately $120 million to $130 million of these charges will result in future cash outlays. The following provides a summary of our estimates of costs associated with the plan by major type of cost: Type of cost Total estimated amount expected to be incurred Restructuring charges: Termination benefits $45 million to $50 million Restructuring-related expenses: Accelerated depreciation $15 million to $20 million Transfer costs (1) $75 million to $80 million $135 million to $150 million (1) Consists primarily of costs to transfer product lines from one facility to another, including costs of transfer teams, freight and product line validations. The estimated restructuring charges relate primarily to termination benefits to be recorded pursuant to FASB Statement No. 112, Employer’s Accounting for Postemployment Benefits and FASB Statement No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. The accelerated depreciation will be recorded through cost of products sold over the new remaining useful life of the related assets and the production line transfer costs will be recorded through cost of products sold as incurred. Litigation-Related Charges In 2008, we recorded a charge of $334 million as a result of a ruling by a federal judge in a patent infringement case brought against us by Johnson & Johnson. In 2007, we recorded a charge of $365 million associated with this case. See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note L — Commitments and Contingencies to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. Interest Expense Our interest expense decreased to $468 million in 2008 as compared to $570 million in 2007. The decrease in our interest expense related primarily to a decrease in our average debt levels, due to debt prepayments of $1.425 billion during the year, as well as a decrease in our average borrowing rate. Our interest expense increased to $570 million in 2007 as compared to $435 million in 2006. The increase in our interest expense related primarily to an increase in our average debt levels, as well as an increase in our average borrowing rate. Our average debt levels for 2007 increased compared to 2006 as a result of carrying a full year of incremental debt due to the acquisition of Guidant in April 2006. Fair Value Adjustment We recorded net expense of $8 million in 2007 and $95 million in 2006 to reflect the change in fair value related to the sharing of proceeds feature of the Abbott stock purchase, which is discussed in further detail in Note D - Acquisitions to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. 59 This sharing of proceeds feature was marked-to-market through earnings based upon changes in our stock price, among other factors. There was no fair value associated with this feature as of December 31, 2007. Other, net Our other, net reflected expense of $58 million in 2008, income of $23 million in 2007, and expense of $56 million in 2006. The following are the components of other, net: Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net losses on investments and notes receivable $ (93 ) $ (54 ) $ (109 ) Interest income 47 79 67 Other (12 ) (2 ) (14 ) $ (58 ) $ 23 $ (56 ) Refer to Note G – Investments and Notes Receivable to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding our investment portfolio. Our interest income decreased in 2008, as compared to 2007, due primarily to lower average investment rates. Our interest income increased in 2007, as compared to 2006, due primarily to higher average cash balances, partially offset by lower average investment rates. Tax Rate The following provides a summary of our reported tax rate: Percentage Point Increase (Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008vs. 2007 2007vs. 2006 Reported tax rate 0.2 % (13.0 )% 1.2 % 13.2 % (14.2 )% Impact of certain charges 18.9 % 25.6 % 20.2 % (6.7 )% 5.4 % In 2008, the increase in our reported tax rate, as compared to 2007, related primarily to the impact of certain charges and gains that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These amounts related primarily to gains and losses associated with the divestiture of certain non-strategic businesses and investments, goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges, litigation-related charges, and changes in the geographic mix of our net sales. In 2007, the decrease in our reported tax rate as compared to 2006 related primarily to additional foreign tax credits, changes in the geographic mix of our net sales, and the impact of certain charges during 2007 that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate. These charges included litigation- and restructuring-related charges, changes to the reserve for uncertain tax positions relating to items originating in prior periods, purchased research and development, and losses associated with the divestiture of non-strategic businesses. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. At December 31, 2008, we had $1.107 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $978 million of which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. At December 31, 2007, we had $1.180 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits, $415 million of which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. The net reduction in our unrecognized tax benefits is attributable primarily to the resolution of certain unrecognized tax positions in 2008. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate increased at December 31, 2008, as compared to December 31, 2007, due to the adoption of FASB Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations, as of January 1, 2009, which requires that we 60 recognize changes in acquired income tax uncertainties (applied to acquisitions before and after the adoption date) as income tax expense or benefit. We are subject to U.S. federal income tax as well as income tax of multiple state and foreign jurisdictions. We have concluded all U.S. federal income tax matters through 2000 and substantially all material state, local, and foreign income tax matters through 2001. Liquidity and Capital Resources The following provides a summary of key performance indicators that we use to assess our liquidity and operating performance. Net Debt3 As of December 31, (in millions) 2008 2007 Short-term debt $ 2 $ 256 Long-term debt 6,743 7,933 Total debt 6,745 8,189 Less: cash and cash equivalents 1,641 1,452 Net debt $ 5,104 $ 6,737 EBITDA4 Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Net loss $ (2,036 ) $ (495 ) $ (3,577 ) Interest income (47 ) (79 ) (67 ) Interest expense 468 570 435 Income tax expense (benefit) 5 (74 ) 42 Depreciation 321 298 251 Amortization 543 620 474 EBITDA $ (746 ) $ 840 $ (2,442 ) 3 Management uses net debt to monitor and evaluate cash and debt levels and believes it is a measure that provides valuable information regarding our net financial position and interest rate exposure. Users of our financial statements should consider this non-GAAP financial information in addition to, not as a substitute for, nor as superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. 4 Management uses EBITDA to assess operating performance and believes that it may assist users of our financial statements in analyzing the underlying trends in our business over time. In addition, management considers adjusted EBITDA as a component of the financial covenants included in our credit agreements. Users of our financial statements should consider this non-GAAP financial information in addition to, not as a substitute for, nor as superior to, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our EBITDA included goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges; acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and restructuring-related net charges (pre-tax) of $2.872 billion for 2008, $1.249 billion for 2007 and $4.622 billion for 2006. See Financial Summary for a description of 2008 charges (credits). In 2007, these charges included: • $21 million of intangible asset impairment charges related to our decision to temporarily suspend further significant funding of the Petal™ bifurcation stent project acquired with Advanced Stent Technologies; • $122 million of acquisition-related charges, including purchased research and development related primarily to our acquisition of Remon Medical Technologies, Inc. and integration costs related to our acquisition of Guidant; • $560 million, primarily non-cash, associated with the write-down of goodwill in connection with the divestiture of non-strategic businesses; • $365 million attributable to estimated potential losses associated with patent litigation with Johnson & Johnson; • $181 million of restructuring charges associated with our on-going expense and head count reduction initiative, net of accelerated depreciation. In 2006, these charges represented costs associated with our acquisition of Guidant Corporation and primarily included: purchased research and development charges; a charge for the step-up value of Guidant inventory sold; and a credit resulting primarily from the reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) program that we obtained as part of our acquisition of TriVascular, Inc. 61 Cash Flow Year Ended December 31, (in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Cash provided by operating activities $ 1,216 $ 934 $ 1,845 Cash provided by (used for) investing activities 324 (474 ) (9,312 ) Cash (used for) provided by financing activities (1,350 ) (680 ) 8,439 Operating Activities Cash generated by our operating activities continues to be a major source of funds for servicing our outstanding debt obligations and investing in our growth. The increase in operating cash flow in 2008, as compared to 2007, is due primarily to the receipt of a $250 million milestone payment from Abbott following the July 2008 FDA approval of the XIENCE V™ everolimus-eluting coronary stent system. In addition, we made lower interest payments of $129 million in 2008, as compared to 2007, due to lower average debt balances. These increases were partially offset by $187 million of payments made in 2008 towards the Guidant multi-district litigation (MDL) settlement, described in Note L – Commitments and Contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. The decrease in operating cash flow in 2007, as compared to 2006, is attributable primarily to: approximately $400 million in tax payments made in the first quarter of 2007, associated principally with the gain on Guidant’s sale of its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to Abbott; an increase in interest payments of $160 million due to higher average debt levels; decreases in EBITDA, excluding acquisition-, divestiture-, litigation- and restructuring-related charges of approximately $150 million; and an increase in severance and other merger and restructuring-related payments of approximately $100 million, including severance payments made in the first half of 2007 in conjunction with our acquisition and integration of Guidant. See Note D – Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further details. Investing Activities We made capital expenditures of $362 million in 2008, $363 million in 2007, and $341 million in 2006. We expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately $375 million during 2009, which includes capital expenditures to upgrade further our quality systems and information systems infrastructure, to enhance our manufacturing capabilities in order to support a second drug-eluting stent platform, and to support continued growth in our business units. During 2008, our investing activities included proceeds of approximately $1.3 billion associated with the divestiture of certain businesses, $95 million of proceeds associated with definitive agreements with Saints Capital and Paul Capital Partners to sell the majority of our investments in, and notes receivable from certain publicly traded and privately held companies, and $54 million from the sale of certain other investments and collections of notes receivable. These cash inflows were partially offset by $675 million in payments related to prior period acquisitions associated primarily with Advanced Bionics, and $39 million of cash payments for investments in privately held companies, and acquisitions of certain technology rights. In addition, we paid $21 million, net of cash acquired, to acquire CryoCor, Inc. and $17 million, net of cash acquired to acquire Labcoat, Ltd. Refer to Note G – Investments and Notes Receivable and Note D – Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. 62 During 2007, our investing activities included $248 million of payments related to prior period acquisitions, associated primarily with Advanced Bionics; and $53 million of cash payments for investments in privately held companies, and acquisitions of certain technology rights. Further, we paid approximately $70 million in cash, net of cash acquired, to acquire Remon Medical Technologies, Inc. We also issued approximately five million shares of our common stock valued at approximately $90 million and paid $10 million in cash, in addition to our previous investments of $40 million, to acquire the remaining interests of EndoTex Interventional Systems, Inc. These cash outflows were partially offset by $243 million of gross proceeds from the sale of several of our investments in, and collection of notes receivable from, certain privately held and publicly traded companies. Refer to Note G – Investments and Notes Receivable and Note D – Acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. During 2006, we paid an aggregate purchase price of approximately $21.7 billion, net of cash acquired, to acquire Guidant Corporation, which included: approximately $7.8 billion of cash; 577 million shares of our common stock at an estimated fair value of $12.5 billion; approximately 40 million of our fully vested stock options granted to Guidant employees at an estimated fair value of $450 million; $97 million associated with the buyout of options of certain former vascular intervention and endovascular solutions Guidant employees; and $770 million of direct acquisition costs, including a $705 million payment made to Johnson & Johnson in connection with the termination of its merger agreement with Guidant. In addition, our investing activities during 2006 included $397 million of payments related to prior period acquisitions, associated primarily with Advanced Bionics, CryoVascular Systems, Inc. and Smart Therapeutics, Inc.; and $98 million of payments for acquisitions of certain technology rights. Partially offsetting these cash outflows were proceeds of $159 million related to the maturity of marketable securities and $33 million of proceeds from the sale of investments in certain privately held companies. Financing Activities Our cash flows from financing activities reflect issuances and repayments of debt, payments for share repurchases and proceeds from stock issuances related to our equity incentive programs. We expect to continue to use a significant portion of our future operating cash flow over the next several years to reduce our debt obligations. Debt We had total debt of $6.745 billion at December 31, 2008 at an average interest rate of 5.65 percent as compared to total debt of $8.189 billion at December 31, 2007 at an average interest rate of 6.36 percent. The debt maturity schedule for the significant components of our debt obligations as of December 31, 2008, is as follows: (in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Term loan $ 825 $ 2,000 $ 2,825 Abbott Laboratories loan 900 900 Senior notes 850 $ 2,200 3,050 $ $ 825 $ 3,750 $ $ $ 2,200 $ 6,775 Note: The table above does not include discounts associated with our Abbott loan and senior notes, or amounts related to interest rate swaps used to hedge the fair value of certain of our senior notes. 63 During 2008, we made debt prepayments of $1.175 billion outstanding under our term loan using cash generated by operations. In addition, we repaid $250 million outstanding under our credit facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. There were no amounts outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2008. We also maintain a separate $2.0 billion revolving credit facility. In 2008, we issued a $717 million surety bond backed by a $702 million letter of credit and $15 million of cash to secure a damage award related to the Johnson & Johnson patent infringement case pending appeal, described in Note L – Commitments and Contingencies, reducing the credit availability under the revolving facility. There were no amounts outstanding under the facility at December 31, 2008. In February 2009, we amended our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement to increase flexibility under our financial covenants. Refer to Note I – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for information regarding the terms of the amendment. At the same time, we prepaid $500 million of our term loan and reduced our revolving credit facility by $250 million. As a result, our next debt maturity is $325 million due in April 2010. During 2007, we prepaid $1.0 billion outstanding under the term loan, using $750 million of cash on hand and $250 million in borrowings against a $350 million credit facility secured by our U.S. trade receivables. In addition, in 2007, cash flows from financing activities included a $60 million contractual payment made to reimburse Abbott for a portion of its cost of borrowing $1.4 billion in 2006 to purchase shares of our common stock in connection with our acquisition of Guidant. Refer to Note D – Acquisitions to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding the Abbott transaction. During 2006, we received net proceeds from borrowings of $6.888 billion, which we used primarily to finance the cash portion of the Guidant acquisition. In addition, we received $1.4 billion from the sale of shares of our common stock to Abbott. Refer to Note D – Acquisitions and Note I – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on the Abbott transaction and our debt obligations. Our term loan and revolving credit facility agreement requires that we maintain certain financial covenants. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the required covenants. Our inability to maintain these covenants could require us to seek to further renegotiate the terms of our credit facilities or seek waivers from compliance with these covenants, both of which could result in additional borrowing costs. See Note I – Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding these covenants. Equity During 2008, we received $71 million in proceeds from stock issuances related to our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, as compared to $132 million in 2007 and $145 million in 2006. Proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and employee stock purchases vary from period to period based upon, among other factors, fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock and in the exercise and stock purchase patterns of employees. We did not repurchase any of our common stock during 2008, 2007 or 2006. Approximately 37 million shares remain under our previous share repurchase authorizations. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table provides a summary of certain information concerning our obligations and commitments to make future payments, which is in addition to our outstanding principal debt obligations as presented in the previous table, and is based on conditions in existence as of December 31, 2008. See Note D - Acquisitions and 64 Note I - Borrowings and Credit Arrangements to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information regarding our acquisition and debt obligations. Payments Due by Period (in millions) 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Lease obligations (1) $ 64 $ 56 $ 45 $ 35 $ 26 $ 57 $ 283 Purchase obligations (1)(2) 338 39 11 4 3 395 Minimum royalty obligations (1) 29 27 14 2 1 6 79 Unrecognized tax benefits 124 124 Interest payments (1)(3) 338 297 199 133 133 747 1,847 $ 893 $ 419 $ 269 $ 174 $ 163 $ 810 $ 2,728 (1) In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these obligations relate to expenses associated with future periods and are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. (2) These obligations relate primarily to inventory commitments and capital expenditures entered in the normal course of business. (3) Interest payment amounts related to our term loan are projected using market interest rates as of December 31, 2008. Future interest payments may differ from these projections based on changes in the market interest rates. The table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of $1.251 billion, the timing of which is uncertain. Refer to Note K– Income Taxes to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on these unrecognized tax benefits. Certain of our acquisitions involve the payment of contingent consideration. See Note D - Acquisitions to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with our recent acquisitions. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, performance milestones will be reached, or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues, the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above. Additionally, we may consider satisfying these commitments by issuing our stock or refinancing the commitments with cash, including cash obtained through the sale of our stock. Payments due to the former shareholders of Advanced Bionics in connection with our amended merger agreement are accrued as of December 31, 2008, and therefore, do not appear in the table above. Certain of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future. Since it is not possible to estimate when, or even if, we will exercise our option to acquire these companies, we have not included these future potential payments in the table above. At December 31, 2008, we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $819 million, as compared to approximately $110 million at December 31, 2007, which consisted primarily of bank guarantees and collateral for workers’ compensation programs. The increase is due primarily to a $702 million letter of credit entered into in 2008 in order to secure a damage award pending appeal related to the Johnson & Johnson patent infringement case. As of December 31, 2008, none of the beneficiaries had drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand and intend to fund these payments without drawing on the letters of credit. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our financial results are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies. We have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. We describe these accounting polices in Note A—Significant Accounting Policies to our 2008 consolidated financial 65 statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results may differ from these estimates. We consider estimates to be critical if (i) we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if (ii) materially different estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period. The following are areas requiring management’s judgment that we consider critical: Revenue Recognition We generate revenue primarily from the sale of single-use medical devices. We consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists; delivery has occurred or services have been rendered; the price is fixed or determinable; and collectibility is reasonably assured. We generally meet these criteria at the time of shipment, unless a consignment arrangement exists or we are required to provide additional services. We recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage, or implant, which indicates that the sale is complete. For our other transactions, we recognize revenue when our products are delivered and risk of loss transfers to the customer, provided there are no substantive remaining performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance, and provided we can form an estimate for sales returns. For multiple-element arrangements where the sale of devices is combined with future service obligations, as with our LATITUDE® Patient Management System, we defer revenue on the undelivered element based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value, and recognize the associated revenue over the related service period. We present revenue net of sales taxes in our consolidated statements of operations. We generally allow our customers to return defective, damaged and, in certain cases, expired products for credit. We base our estimate for sales returns upon historical trends and record the amount as a reduction to revenue when we sell the initial product. In addition, we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next-generation product offerings; for these transactions, we defer recognition of revenue based upon an estimate of the amount of product to be returned when the next-generation products are shipped to the customer. We offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers. We treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current. We estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates. If we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably, we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered. We have entered certain agreements with group purchasing organizations to sell our products to participating hospitals at negotiated prices. We recognize revenue from these agreements following the same revenue recognition criteria discussed above. Inventory Provisions We base our provisions for excess and obsolete inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales. A significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess and obsolete inventory in the future. The industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions. Uncertain timing of next-generation product approvals, variability in product launch strategies, product recalls and variation in product utilization all affect our estimates related to excess and obsolete inventory. 66 Valuation of Business Combinations We record intangible assets acquired in business combinations under the purchase method of accounting. We allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition in accordance with FASB Statement No. 141, Business Combinations, including identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development which either arise from a contractual or legal right or are separable from goodwill. We base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets and purchased research and development on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. We allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired to goodwill. The use of alternative valuation assumptions, including estimated cash flows and discount rates, and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations, purchased research and development charges, and intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods. Purchased Research and Development Our purchased research and development represents the value of acquired in-process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition. The primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region. Through December 31, 2008, we have expensed the value attributable to these in-process projects at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accounting standards effective through that date. If the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner, we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisition as a whole. In addition, we record certain costs associated with our alliances as purchased research and development. We use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development. This approach calculates fair value by estimating the after-tax cash flows attributable to an in-process project over its useful life and then discounting these after-tax cash flows back to a present value. We base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes, expected market growth rates, expected trends in technology and expected levels of market share. In arriving at the value of the in-process projects, we consider, among other factors: the in-process projects’ stage of completion; the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date; the costs already incurred; the projected costs to complete; the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets; the expected introduction date; and the estimated useful life of the technology. We base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors. For the in-process projects acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions, we used the following ranges of risk-adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows: 34 percent in 2008, 19 percent in 2007, and 13 percent to 17 percent in 2006. We believe that the estimated in-process research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects. Impairment of Intangible Assets We review intangible assets subject to amortization quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in the remaining useful life. Conditions that may indicate impairment include, but are not limited to, a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect the value of an asset, a product recall, or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator. If an impairment indicator exists we test the intangible asset for recoverability. For purposes of the recoverability test, we group our intangible assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows if the intangible asset does not generate cash flows independent of other assets and liabilities. If the carrying value of the intangible asset (asset group) exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the intangible asset (asset group), we will write the carrying value down to the fair value in the period identified. In addition, we review our indefinite-lived intangible 67 assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite-lived assets. To test for impairment, we calculate the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset, the carrying value is written down to the fair value. We generally calculate fair value of our intangible assets as the present value of estimated future cash flows we expect to generate from the asset using a risk-adjusted discount rate. In determining our estimated future cash flows associated with our intangible assets, we use estimates and assumptions about future revenue contributions, cost structures and remaining useful lives of the asset (asset group). The use of alternative assumptions, including estimated cash flows, discount rates, and alternative estimated remaining useful lives could result in different calculations of impairment. See Note A - Significant Accounting Policies and Note E - Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information related to impairment of intangible assets during 2008, 2007 and 2006. Goodwill Impairment We test our goodwill balances as of April 1 during the second quarter of each year for impairment. We test our goodwill balances more frequently if indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist. In performing the test, we utilize the two-step approach prescribed under FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The first step requires a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting units, as defined, to the fair value of these units. We have identified our domestic divisions, which in aggregate make up the U.S. reportable segment, and our two international operating segments as our reporting units for purposes of the goodwill impairment test. To derive the carrying value of our reporting units at the time of acquisition, we assign goodwill to the reporting units that we expect to benefit from the respective business combination. In addition, for purposes of performing our annual goodwill impairment test, assets and liabilities, including corporate assets, which relate to a reporting unit’s operations, and would be considered in determining fair value, are allocated to the individual reporting units. We allocate assets and liabilities not directly related to a specific reporting unit, but from which the reporting unit benefits, based primarily on the respective revenue contribution of each reporting unit. If the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we will perform the second step of the goodwill impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit’s goodwill to its carrying value. If we were unable to complete the second step of the test prior to the issuance of our financial statements and an impairment loss was probable and could be reasonably estimated, we would recognize our best estimate of the loss in our current period financial statements and disclose that the amount is an estimate. We would then recognize any adjustment to that estimate in subsequent reporting periods, once we have finalized the second step of the impairment test. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we recorded a $2.613 billion goodwill impairment charge associated with our acquisition of Guidant. The decline in our stock price and our market capitalization during the fourth quarter created an indication of potential impairment of our goodwill balance; therefore, we performed an interim impairment test. Key factors contributing to the impairment charge included disruptions in the credit and equity market, and the resulting impacts to weighted-average cost of capital, and changes in CRM market demand relative to our original assumptions at the time of acquisition. Refer to Note E – Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information. Investments in Publicly Traded and Privately Held Entities We account for investments in entities over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold 50 percent or less of the voting stock and the entity is not a variable interest 68 entity in which we are the primary beneficiary. We account for investments in entities over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method. Our determination of whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an entity requires judgment. We consider the guidance in Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 18, The Equity Method of Accounting for Investments in Common Stock, Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03-16, Accounting for Investments in Limited Liability Companies, and EITF Topic D-46, Accounting for Limited Partnership Investments, in determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an entity. We regularly review our investments for impairment indicators. If we determine that impairment exists and it is other-than-temporary, we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment’s carrying value and its fair value. See Note A - Significant Accounting Policies and Note G- Investments and Notes Receivable to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a detailed analysis of our investments and our accounting treatment for our investment portfolio. Income Taxes We utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse. We recognized net deferred tax liabilities of $1.351 billion at December 31, 2008 and $1.605 billion at December 31, 2007. The liabilities relate primarily to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions. The assets relate primarily to the establishment of inventory and product-related reserves, litigation and product liability reserves, purchased research and development, investment write-downs, net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards. In light of our historical financial performance, we believe we will recover substantially all of these assets. We reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based upon the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets. We consider relevant evidence, both positive and negative, to determine the need for a valuation allowance. Information evaluated includes our financial position and results of operations for the current and preceding years, as well as an evaluation of currently available information about future years. We do not provide income taxes on unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries where we have indefinitely reinvested such earnings in our foreign operations. It is not practical to estimate the amount of income taxes payable on the earnings that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Unremitted earnings of our foreign subsidiaries that we have indefinitely reinvested offshore are $9.327 billion at December 31, 2008 and $7.804 billion at December 31, 2007. We provide for potential amounts due in various tax jurisdictions. In the ordinary course of conducting business in multiple countries and tax jurisdictions, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision. In our opinion, we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which we make such determination. See Note K — Income Taxes to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a detailed analysis of our income tax accounting. 69 Legal, Product Liability Costs and Securities Claims We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings, including intellectual property, breach of contract, securities litigation and product liability suits. In some cases, the claimants seek damages, as well as other relief, which, if granted, could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products. We are substantially self-insured with respect to product liability claims. We maintain insurance policies providing limited coverage against securities claims. We generally record losses for claims in excess of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable. In accordance with FASB Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, we accrue anticipated costs of settlement, damages, losses for general product liability claims and, under certain conditions, costs of defense, based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable. Otherwise, we expense these costs as incurred. If the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely, we accrue the minimum amount of the range. Our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was $1.089 billion at December 31, 2008 and $994 million at December 31, 2007, and includes estimated costs of settlement, damages and defense. The increase in our accrual is due primarily to a pre-tax charge of $334 million resulting from a ruling by a federal judge in a patent infringement case brought against us by Johnson & Johnson, which we recorded during the third quarter of 2008. Partially offsetting this increase was a reduction of $187 million as a result of payments made in the fourth quarter of 2008 related to the Guidant multi-district litigation (MDL) settlement described in Note L – Commitments and Contingencies. In the first quarter of 2009, we made an additional MDL payment of approximately $13 million, and anticipate making the remaining payments of $20 million during the first half of 2009. These amounts were both accrued as of December 31, 2008. We continue to assess certain litigation and claims to determine the amounts that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and, therefore, additional losses may be accrued in the future, which could adversely impact our operating results, cash flows and our ability to comply with our debt covenants. See further discussion of our material legal proceedings in Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Note L — Commitments and Contingencies to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for further discussion of our individual material legal proceedings. New Accounting Standards Standards Implemented Interpretation No. 48 In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions. We adopted Interpretation No. 48 as of the first quarter of 2007. Interpretation No. 48 requires the use of a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, as well as enhanced disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions, including a roll forward of tax benefits taken that do not qualify for financial statement recognition. Refer to Note K – Income Taxes to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information regarding our application of Interpretation No. 48 and its impact on our consolidated financial statements. Statement No. 157 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. Statement No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. Statement No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements; rather, it applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. We adopted the provisions of Statement No. 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities as of January 1, 2008, and will apply those provisions to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as of January 1, 2009. Refer to Note C – Fair Value Measurements to our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a discussion of our adoption of Statement No. 157 and its impact on our financial statements. 70 Statement No. 158 In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which amends Statements Nos. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R). Statement No. 158 requires recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the consolidated statements of financial position, as well as the recognition of certain gains and losses that arise during the period, but are deferred under pension accounting rules, in other comprehensive income (loss). Additionally, Statement No. 158 requires that, beginning with fiscal years ending after December 15, 2008, a business entity measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of its fiscal year-end statement of financial position. We adopted the measurement-date requirement in 2008 and the other provisions of Statement No. 158 in 2006. Refer to Note A – Significant Accounting Policies to our 2008 consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Annual Report for more information on our pension and other postretirement plans. Statement No. 159 In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, which allows an entity to elect to record financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value upon their initial recognition on a contract-by-contract basis. We adopted Statement No. 159 as of January 1, 2008 and did not elect the fair value option for our eligible financial assets and financial liabilities. New Standards to be Implemented Statement No. 161 In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends Statement No. 133 by requiring expanded disclosures about an entity’s derivative instruments and hedging activities. Statement No. 161 requires increased qualitative, quantitative, and credit-risk disclosures, including (a) how and why an entity uses derivative instruments, (b) how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under Statement No. 133 and its related interpretations, and (c) how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity’s financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. We are required to adopt Statement No. 161 for our first quarter ending March 31, 2009. Staff Position No. 157-2 In February 2008, the FASB released Staff Position No. 157-2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delays the effective date of Statement No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except for those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We are required to apply the provisions of Statement No. 157 to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as of January 1, 2009. We do not believe the adoption of Staff Position No. 157-2 will have a material impact on our future results of operations or financial position. Statement No. 141(R) In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 141(R), Business Combinations, a replacement for Statement No. 141. Statement No. 141(R) retains the fundamental requirements of Statement No. 141, but requires the recognition of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination at their fair values as of the acquisition date. It also requires the recognition of assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies at their acquisition date fair values. Additionally, Statement No. 141(R) supersedes FASB Interpretation No. 4, Applicability of FASB Statement No. 2 to Business Combinations Accounted for by the Purchase Method, which required research and development assets acquired in a business combination that had no alternative future use to be measured at their fair values and expensed at the acquisition date. 71 Statement No. 141(R) now requires that purchased research and development be recognized as an intangible asset. We are required to adopt Statement No. 141(R) prospectively for any acquisitions on or after January 1, 2009, except for changes in tax assets and liabilities associated with prior acquisitions. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting As the management of Boston Scientific Corporation, we are responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We designed our internal control system to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of our financial statements. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control—Integrated Framework. Based on our assessment, we believe that, as of December 31, 2008, our internal control over financial reporting is effective at a reasonable assurance level based on these criteria. Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an audit report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This report in which they expressed an unqualified opinion is included below. /s/ James R. Tobin /s/ Sam R. Leno James R. Tobin Sam R. Leno President and Chief Executive Officer Executive Vice President – Finance & Information Systems and Chief Financial Officer 72 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm The Board of Directors and Shareholders of Boston Scientific Corporation We have audited Boston Scientific Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO criteria). Boston Scientific Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. In our opinion, Boston Scientific Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2008, based on the COSO criteria. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States), the consolidated balance sheets of Boston Scientific Corporation as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007 and the related consolidated statements of operations, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2008 of Boston Scientific Corporation and our report dated February 24, 2009 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Boston, Massachusetts February 24, 2009 73 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We develop, manufacture and sell medical devices globally and our earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. We address these risks through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments. We operate the program pursuant to documented corporate risk management policies. We do not enter derivative transactions for speculative purposes. Gains and losses on derivative financial instruments substantially offset losses and gains on underlying hedged exposures. Furthermore, we manage our exposure to counterparty risk on derivative instruments by entering into contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions and by actively monitoring outstanding positions. Our currency risk consists primarily of foreign currency denominated firm commitments, forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany and third party transactions and net investments in certain subsidiaries. We use both nonderivative (primarily European manufacturing operations) and derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in currency exchange rates. We had currency derivative instruments outstanding in the contract amount of $4.396 billion at December 31, 2008 and $4.135 billion at December 31, 2007. We recorded $132 million of other assets and $195 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of these derivative instruments at December 31, 2008 as compared to $19 million of other assets and $118 million of other liabilities at December 31, 2007. A ten percent appreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $315 million at December 31, 2008 and by $293 million at December 31, 2007. A ten percent depreciation in the U.S. dollar’s value relative to the hedged currencies would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $385 million at December 31, 2008 and by $355 million at December 31, 2007. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our currency exchange rate sensitive derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged underlying asset, liability or forecasted transaction. Our interest rate risk relates primarily to U.S. dollar borrowings partially offset by U.S. dollar cash investments. We use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our earnings and cash flow exposure to changes in interest rates. We had interest rate derivative instruments outstanding in the notional amount of $4.9 billion at December 31, 2008 and $1.5 billion at December 31, 2007. The notional amount increase is due to new hedge contracts of $4.4 billion entered into during 2008, partially offset by a scheduled hedge reduction of $1.0 billion on our existing contracts. We recorded $46 million of other liabilities to recognize the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments at December 31, 2008 as compared to $17 million at December 31, 2007. A one-percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the derivative instruments’ fair value by $32 million at December 31, 2008, as compared to an increase of $9 million at December 31, 2007. A one-percentage point decrease in interest rates would decrease the derivative instruments’ fair value by $35 million at December 31, 2008 as compared to a decrease of $9 million at December 31, 2007. Any increase or decrease in the fair value of our interest rate derivative instruments would be substantially offset by a corresponding decrease or increase in the fair value of the hedged interest payments related to our LIBOR-indexed floating rate loans. At December 31, 2008, $6.518 billion of our outstanding debt obligations was at fixed interest rates or had been converted to fixed interest rates through the use of interest rate derivative instruments, representing 97 percent of our total debt.
