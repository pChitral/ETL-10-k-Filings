804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the “Our Business and Operating Segments” section under the heading “Seasonality.”Corporate StructureWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.Revenue Concentrations and Significant CustomersA small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2022, revenues from Apple and Samsung each comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. Additional information regarding revenue concentrations is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.”Research and DevelopmentThe wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and, with the use of 5G, the expansion into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets such as automotive and IoT, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in modem, radio-frequency integrated circuit, RFFE, multimedia (camera, video, display and computer vision), sensor perception and drive policy, advanced SoC, which includes specialized engines such as CPU and GPU to enable high performance and low-power computing and other optimization techniques, AI, packaging and a broad range of other technologies. We expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products and technologies and to utilize that research and development in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT), including continuing the development of new modem and multimedia technologies and other technologies (such as ADAS/AD and XR), developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world.We continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in OFDMA-based technologies and products (including LTE and 5G). We also engage in acquisitions and other transactions to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or open or expand opportunities for our technologies and to support the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhance existing products and services) for voice and data communications and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as ADAS/AD. We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops, voice and music devices, wearable devices and XR devices) and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G, 4G and 5G technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, location positioning and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other client software environments in our chipsets.We develop innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition.14We have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world that support our global development activities and ongoing efforts to develop and/or advance 4G, 5G, RFFE and a broad range of other technologies. We continue to use our substantial engineering resources and expertise to develop new technologies, applications and services and make them available to licensees to help grow the communications industry and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities.Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human CapitalWe believe that our innovations have helped transform industries, enhance people’s lives and address some of society’s biggest challenges. With the world becoming increasingly connected, we have an opportunity to shape a better future. We believe in the power of technology. As such, our corporate responsibility vision is to be a facilitator of innovation for a sustainable world, connected wirelessly.We have integrated corporate responsibility throughout our business, from our daily operations to our executive leadership and our Board of Directors (Board). The Governance Committee of our Board provides oversight on corporate responsibility matters, including ESG policies, programs and initiatives, and the HR and Compensation Committee of our Board provides oversight on our workforce diversity, equity and inclusion programs and initiatives. Our ESG Leadership Committee, composed of executives and senior management, provides guidance on global corporate responsibility issues. Our ESG Governance Committee implements directives from the ESG Leadership Committee, measures progress on achieving our goals and reports to management on accomplishments and challenges.ESGWe believe that our sustained investment in research and development has helped revolutionize the way people connect. We center our ESG efforts around purposeful innovation, focusing on three strategic focus areas where we believe we can have the biggest impact:•Empowering Digital Transformation. We believe technology can transform industries, businesses, communities and individual lives. We invent solutions that are foundational to the advancement of the global wireless ecosystem, improving how we work, live and, ultimately, thrive. •Acting Responsibly. We invest in our people, behave with integrity and implement governance standards that uphold Qualcomm’s values. We are committed to responsible business practices, from prioritizing diversity, equity and inclusion, to protecting privacy, to providing leading development programs and to creating an ethical culture.•Operating Sustainably. We are committed to maintaining safe, healthy and productive working conditions and conserving natural resources. Our environmental efforts center on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, optimizing energy consumption, managing water usage and minimizing waste throughout our operations and the communities in which we work. 2025 Goals. In addition to the human capital goals discussed below, our 2025 Goals related to corporate responsibility include, among others:•Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 30% from global operations, compared to a 2014 baseline.•Reducing power consumption by 10% every year in our flagship Snapdragon Mobile Platform products (given equivalent features).•Ensuring 100% of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers are audited every 2-years for conformance to our Supplier Code of Conduct.Net-Zero Global GHG Emissions Commitment. In addition to our 2025 Goals, in November 2021, we announced plans to: (1) reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 from a 2020 base year; (2) reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 from a 2020 base year; and (3) reach net-zero global GHG emissions for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2040.The foregoing discussion includes information regarding ESG matters that we believe may be of interest to our stockholders generally. We recognize that certain other stakeholders (such as customers, employees and non-governmental organizations), as well as certain of our stockholders, may be interested in more detailed information on these topics. We encourage you to review our most recent Qualcomm Corporate Responsibility Report (located on our website) for more detailed information regarding our Corporate Responsibility and ESG governance, goals, priorities, accomplishments and initiatives; a 5G and sustainability report, Environmental Sustainability and a Greener Economy: The Transformative Role of 5G (also located on our website) for additional information regarding our views on climate change, environmental sustainability and the role of 5G in enabling a more sustainable future; as well as the Corporate Governance section of our most recent Proxy Statement, and our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices (located on our website), for additional information regarding governance matters, including Board and Committee leadership, oversight, roles and responsibilities, and Director independence, tenure, refreshment and diversity. Nothing on our website, including the aforementioned reports, documents or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.15Human Capital In order to continue to produce the innovative, breakthrough technologies for which we are known, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Qualcomm a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.At September 25, 2022, we had approximately 51,000 full-time, part-time and temporary employees, the overwhelming majority of which were full-time employees. During fiscal 2022, the number of employees increased by approximately 6,000, primarily due to increases in engineering resources, including those hired through acquisitions. Our employees are represented by more than 100 (self-identified) nationalities working in over 150 locations in 37 different countries around the world. Collectively, we speak more than 90 different languages. Our global workforce is highly educated, with the substantial majority of our employees working in engineering or technical roles (many of whom help develop foundational technologies for both our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business). During fiscal 2022, our voluntary turnover rate was less than 10%, lower than the technology industry benchmark, which is comprised of certain of our key competitors (Aon, 2022 Salary Increase and Turnover Study - Second Edition, September 2022).Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We believe that a diverse workforce is important to our success, and we continue to focus on the hiring, retention and advancement of women and underrepresented populations. Our recent efforts have been focused in three areas: inspiring innovation through an inclusive and diverse culture; expanding our efforts to recruit and hire world-class diverse talent; and identifying strategic partners to accelerate our inclusion, equity and diversity programs. We have employee networks that enhance our inclusive and diverse culture, including global network groups focused on supporting women, LGBTQ+ employees and employees with disabilities, in addition to U.S.-based employee networks that focus on Black and African American employees, Hispanic and Latinx employees and U.S. military members and veterans.We continue to recruit technical talent in diverse communities, including by engaging as a high-level sponsor of professional conferences, such as the Grace Hopper Celebration, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers National Convention and the National Society of Black Engineers National Convention. We also continue to recruit from a variety of colleges including Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Women’s Colleges. Our continued engagement with organizations that work with diverse communities has been vital to our efforts to increase women and minority representation in our workforce. For example, we partner with AnitaB.org to benchmark our progress and to identify promising practices for recruiting, retaining and advancing women technologists, and we support its research initiatives related to attracting and retaining women and underrepresented minority students in computing majors. We, alongside other top technology companies, helped form the Reboot Representation Tech Coalition, which aims to double the number of Black, Latinx and Native American women receiving computing degrees by 2025. Through our collaboration with Disability:IN’s Inclusion Works program, we have increased our ability to address the needs of individuals with disabilities. We publish our most recent Consolidated EEO-1 reports on our website to provide additional transparency into our efforts to increase underrepresented populations in our workforce. We have also publicly set 2025 goals around diverse workforce and leadership representation, as described below.From a governance perspective, the HR and Compensation Committee of our Board provides oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on workforce diversity, equity and inclusion.Health, Safety and Wellness. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we took a variety of measures that we determined were in the best interests of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and we have recently implemented a “hybrid” work model, meaning that the majority of our employees have flexibility to work remotely at least some of the time. The hybrid work model is intended to provide increased flexibility and support employee health and safety, while maintaining our strong culture of innovation, collaboration, openness and camaraderie. We continue to monitor the state of the pandemic and gather additional feedback to facilitate the continued health, safety and wellness of our employees working onsite. We also introduced our Live+Well, Work+Well program, designed to help cultivate a productive work environment, while also focusing on our employees’ well-being.Compensation and Benefits. We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include annual bonuses, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption and surrogacy assistance, 16employee assistance programs, tuition assistance, and on-site services such as health centers and fitness centers, among others. In addition to our broad-based equity award programs, we have used targeted equity awards with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical engineering skills and experience.Talent Development. We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a world-leading wireless innovator. We deliver numerous training opportunities, provide rotational assignment opportunities, focus on continuous learning and development and have implemented what we believe are industry-leading methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop talent.Our talent development programs are designed to provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We provide a series of employee workshops around the globe that support professional growth and development. Additionally, our manager and employee forum programs provide an ongoing opportunity for employees to practice and apply learning around conversations aligned with our annual review process. We also have an employee development website that provides quick access to learning resources that are personalized to the individual’s development needs.Building Connections - With Each Other and our Communities. We believe that building connections between our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Through our engagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteering and giving opportunities and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members. Leveraging our partnerships with various local arts and culture organizations, we have created numerous unique experiences for employees and their families around the world. Since our employees are passionate about many causes, our corporate giving and volunteering programs support and encourage employees by engaging with those causes. In our offices around the world, our employee-led Giving Committees select local organizations to support, often in the form of grants that are primarily funded by the Qualcomm Foundation (which was established in 2011 to support charitable giving and volunteerism). We also frequently collaborate with these organizations on volunteer activities for our employees. Additionally, during fiscal 2022, thousands of our employees around the world utilized our charitable match program, benefiting more than 1,500 charitable organizations.2025 Goals. We set the following 2025 Goals related to human capital, with a focus on diversity, equity and inclusion:•Increase women in leadership by 15% (defined as individuals at the principal and above level in technical roles, and director and above in non-technical roles). •Increase underrepresented minorities (URM) in leadership by 15% (for technical positions, “URM” includes Black, Hispanic or Latinx, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Native American; for non-technical positions, URM also includes Asian). •Increase overall URM representation by 20%.Human Capital Advancements Linked to our Executive Compensation. The HR and Compensation Committee of our Board will consider human capital advancements in determining our executives’ fiscal 2022 bonus. For fiscal 2022, progress towards human capital advancements serves as a non-financial performance modifier that can adjust the executives’ bonus payout by a multiple of 0.9 to 1.1. The foregoing discussion includes information regarding Human Capital matters that we believe may be of interest to stockholders generally. We recognize that certain other stakeholders (such as customers, employees and non-governmental organizations), as well as certain of our stockholders, may be interested in more detailed information on these topics. We encourage you to review the “Our People” section of our most recent Qualcomm Corporate Responsibility Report (located on our website) for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital goals, programs and initiatives.

Risk FactorsYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” References to “and,” “or” and “and/or” should be read to include the others, as appropriate.RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSESWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Certain Chinese OEMs continue to grow their device share in China and are increasing their device share in regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. See also “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies - Concentrations.” In addition, a number of our largest integrated circuit customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products, or may choose our competitors’ integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products, which could significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).”Further, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.”In addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers’ feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.The loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by any of these customers or the cancellation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors’ integrated circuit products, government restrictions, a decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, a decline in consumer demand, elevated inventory levels at our customers or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations. A delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development. Further, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers’ new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate. Apple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.Our industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), or a shift in share away 19from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development. Further, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration. Although we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees’ products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues. Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).Certain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).Apple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors’ products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel’s modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.Similarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.”In addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.If some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled “We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.”A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in their devices and sell those devices into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.Due to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (including its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our Chinese integrated circuit customers have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices, or use our competitors’ integrated circuit products in their devices, rather than our products, which could materially harm our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).”Political actions, including trade protection and national security policies of the U.S. and Chinese governments, such as tariffs, bans or placing companies on restricted entity lists, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or 20prevent us from transacting business with certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers, limit, prevent or discourage certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so. Given our revenue concentration in China, if, due to actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies: we were further limited in, or prohibited from, selling our integrated circuit products to Chinese OEMs; our non-Chinese OEM customers were limited in, or prohibited from, selling devices into China that incorporate our integrated circuit products; Chinese OEMs develop and use their own integrated circuit products or use our competitors’ integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices rather than our integrated circuit products; Chinese tariffs on our integrated circuit products or on devices which incorporate our integrated circuit products made purchasing such products or devices more expensive to Chinese OEMs or Chinese consumers; or our Chinese licensees delay or cease making payments of license fees they owe us, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. Similarly, if, due to U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, we were limited in or prohibited from obtaining critical integrated circuit products from our suppliers in China, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. See also the Risk Factor titled “We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.” Finally, government policies in China that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of the country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of, and/or ability to receive, payments from our customers and licensees in China, which may negatively impact our cash flows.RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVESOur growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.While we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support 5G-based technologies, we also invest in new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, by utilizing our existing technical and business expertise and through acquisitions or other strategic transactions.In particular, our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies and products for these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; and third parties incorporating our technologies and products into devices used in these product areas, industries and applications. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and in developing new products and technologies for these product areas, industries and applications. Our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent 5G technologies, and to develop and commercialize products using 5G technologies.However, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and corresponding technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products and new technologies in mobile handsets, may not succeed because, among other reasons: we may not be issued patents on the technologies we develop; the technologies we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standards; new and expanded product areas, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, and consumer demand therein, may not develop or grow as anticipated; we may be unable to attract or retain employees with the necessary skills in such new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; our strategies or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be successful; alternate technologies or products may be better or may reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors’ technologies or products may be more cost effective, have more capabilities or fewer limitations or be brought to market faster than our new technologies or products; we may not be able to develop, or our competitors may have more established and/or stronger, customer, vendor, distributor or other channel relationships; and competitors may have longer operating histories in industries and applications that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of, or overestimate the future revenues or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns. Further, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in significant barriers to entry and increased costs. If our products fail to perform to specifications, compete with the product quality of our competitors or meet quality and/or regulatory standards of a particular industry or application (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry), we may be unable to successfully expand our business in that industry or application, and our growth could be limited. In addition, in order to successfully extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we may need to transition to new business models and transform aspects of our organization, and we may not be successful in doing so.21If we are not successful in extending our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, if our new technologies and products are not successful, or if we are not successful in the time frames we anticipate, we may incur significant costs and asset impairments, our business and revenues may not grow or grow as anticipated, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted, our stock price may decline and our reputation may be harmed.We may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.We engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions, including joint ventures, and make investments, which we believe are important to the future of our business, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. We routinely acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions, and purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies, including those that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our products and technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products (or enhancing existing products) for mobile handsets, and for industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Many of our strategic activities entail a high degree of risk and require the use of significant amounts of capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not be successful, generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or products. We may underestimate the costs or overestimate the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership or variable interests. In addition, we have in the past recorded, and may in the future record, impairment or other charges related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited.Achieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, facilities, technology, products, processes, operations (including supply and manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers and suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not derive any commercial value from associated technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these technologies, and we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain, and we may become subject to litigation. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sales or distribution channels, business or operational models, geographic regions, industries and applications served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of our strategic acquisitions.If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions or other strategic activities, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transactions.Many of our acquisitions and other strategic investments require approval by the United States and/or foreign government agencies. Certain agencies in the past have, and may in the future, deny the transaction or fail to approve in a timely manner, resulting in us not realizing the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction. Future acquisitions or other strategic investments may be more difficult, complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to consummate acquisitions has been or is in the future harmed. Further, if U.S./China relations remain strained, our ability to consummate any transaction that would require approval from the relevant regulatory agency(ies) in China may be severely impacted. In addition, acquisitions that we have completed could subsequently be reviewed and/or challenged by government agencies, which could result in fines, penalties or other liability, or requirements to divest all or a portion of an acquired business.RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURINGWe depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.We primarily utilize a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Other than the facilities we own that manufacture certain of our RFFE modules and RF (radio frequency) filter products, we rely on third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. There are a limited number of such third-party suppliers, and even fewer who are capable of manufacturing at the leading process technology nodes or who are willing to operate at older process technology nodes necessary for certain of our integrated circuit products. The semiconductor manufacturing 22foundries that supply our products are primarily located in Asia, as are the primary warehouses where we store finished goods for fulfillment of customer orders. The following issues related to our third-party suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively impact our revenues, business operations, profitability and cash flows:•our suppliers’ failure or inability to react to shifts in product demand, including situations where demand for integrated circuits exceeds suppliers’ capacity to meet that demand;•a failure or inability by our suppliers to procure raw materials or allocate adequate raw materials for our products, or an increase in prices for raw materials or components;•an inability to procure or utilize raw materials, components or products from our suppliers due to government prohibitions or restrictions on transactions with certain countries and/or companies, and alternative suppliers, raw material sources or raw materials are not available or not available in acceptable time frames or upon acceptable terms;•a failure by our suppliers to allocate adequate manufacturing, assembly or test capacity for our products;•our suppliers’ failure or inability to develop or maintain, or a delay in developing or building out, manufacturing capacity for leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies;•the loss of a supplier or the failure or inability of a supplier to meet performance, quality or yield specifications or delivery schedules; •additional expense or production delays as a result of qualifying a new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of, or a decision to add or change, a supplier;•natural disasters, the effects of climate change, acts of war or other geopolitical conflicts impacting the regions in which our suppliers and their manufacturing foundries or assembly, test or other facilities are located;•health crises, including epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and government and business responses thereto, which impact our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines or closures; •cyber-attacks on our suppliers’ information technology (IT) systems, including those related to their manufacturing foundries or assembly, test or other facilities;•trade or national security protection policies, particularly U.S. or Chinese government policies, that limit or prevent us from transacting business with suppliers of critical integrated circuit products, or that limit or prevent such suppliers from transacting business with us or from procuring materials, machinery or technology necessary to manufacture goods for us; and •any other reduction, interruption, delay or limitation in our product supply sources.We rely on sole- or limited-source suppliers for certain products, which may exacerbate the risks identified above, and subject us to other significant risks, including poor product performance and reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing capability and yields, quality assurance, quantity and costs. While we have established and may in the future establish alternate suppliers for certain products, these suppliers may require significant amounts of time and levels of support to bring such products to production, both of which may increase for complex or leading process technologies. As a result, we may invest a significant amount of effort and resources and incur higher costs to support and maintain such alternate suppliers. Further, the elimination or limitation of a foundry supplier’s ability to manufacture components or products for us due to trade or national security protection policies could increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and limit or prevent us from procuring critical components or products from those suppliers. Future consolidation of foundry suppliers could also increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and reduce our suppliers’ willingness to negotiate pricing, which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reductions, increase our manufacturing costs and limit the amount of capacity available to us. Our arrangements with our suppliers may obligate us to incur costs to manufacture, assemble and test our products that do not decrease at the same rate as decreases in pricing to our customers. Our ability, and that of our suppliers, to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies (which adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability), and to effectively compete with the manufacturing processes and performance of our competitors, could impact our ability to introduce new products and meet customer demand, could increase our costs (possibly decreasing our margins) and could subject us to the risk of excess inventories. Any of the above could negatively impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.Although we have long-term contracts with our suppliers, some of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific quantity, our suppliers may allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the manufacture, assembly and testing of products for their other customers (including our competitors) while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture, assemble or test our products, and such capacity may be limited based on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to invest in the capital required to manufacture in the leading process technologies. Our suppliers or potential alternate suppliers may also manufacture their own integrated circuits that compete with our products. Such suppliers have in the past allocated and may again allocate raw materials and manufacturing capacity to their own products and reduce or limit the production of our 23products. To the extent we do obtain long-term capacity commitments, we may incur additional costs related to those commitments or make non-refundable payments for capacity commitments that are not used. Further, certain of our suppliers have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to unilaterally reduce their capacity commitments to us. Accordingly, capacity for our products may not be available when we need it. Finally, we may not receive reasonable pricing, manufacturing or delivery terms from our suppliers, and our ability to obtain favorable terms may be diminished during times of high demand and/or limited manufacturing capacity for integrated circuit products. We cannot guarantee that the actions of our suppliers will not cause disruptions in our operations that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers or increase our cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to obtain adequate supply to meet our delivery obligations, we may be obligated to make payments to our customers for such shortfalls. Recently, the global semiconductor industry experienced demand for integrated circuits that exceeded the industry’s capacity to meet that demand. Our ability to meet increased demand for our products has been and may in the future be limited due to the inability to obtain the additional manufacturing, assembly and test capacity necessary to fully meet such demand. If we are unable to fully meet customer demand, this could result in lost sales opportunities, reduced revenue growth and harm to our customer relationships. These issues may be exacerbated if customers overstate their expected demand requirements in order to procure additional supply, which could negatively impact our ability to forecast and to allocate supply appropriately among our customers. The above issues may also be exacerbated with respect to our platform solutions, which already entail a great deal of complexity due to differing lead-times, technologies and suppliers for each integrated circuit product included in such solutions. Additionally, our suppliers have in the past and may in the future increase their prices during periods of capacity constraints, or for other reasons, thus increasing our costs. While capacity constraints have largely abated, we continue to see price increases from certain of our key semiconductor manufacturing suppliers which, without corresponding increases in the prices of our products, would negatively impact our margins.We place orders with our suppliers using our and our customers’ forecasts of demand for our products, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates. As we move to smaller geometry process technologies, the manufacturing lead-time increases. As a result, the orders we place with our suppliers are generally only partially covered by commitments from our customers. If we, or our customers, overestimate demand, or if demand is impacted by factors outside of our or our customers’ control, and such demand is not covered by a binding commitment from our customers, we may experience increased excess or obsolete inventory or reserve charges, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Further, to the extent our customers procure supply of our integrated circuit products beyond their current needs (i.e., build up inventory of our integrated circuit products), whether due to concerns over supply, overestimating demand and/or a decline in macroeconomic conditions, or otherwise, they may not purchase expected quantities of our products in subsequent quarters, which may negatively impact our revenues, results of operations and cash flows in such quarters.See also the Risk Factor below titled “There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues” as similar risks, as well as additional risks, may be applicable to our third-party suppliers’ manufacturing facilities, which could result in disruptions to our business or additional costs to us, and negatively impact our results of operations.There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues.We operate various facilities that manufacture certain of our RFFE modules and RF filter products. Our manufacturing facilities are characterized by a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model. We may be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products, including in less favorable industry or macroeconomic environments, or due to our failure to win and/or retain designs with OEMs. As a result, from time to time our manufacturing facilities operate at lower capacity levels, while the fixed costs associated with such facilities continue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit. Due to the factors above, we are currently experiencing, and expect to continue to experience in the near term, such underutilization of capacity at our manufacturing facilities. We are subject to many complex environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and rules in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing (and research and development) facilities. The regulatory landscape in these areas continues to evolve, and we anticipate additional laws, regulations and rules in the future. In particular, new, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules, including relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investments in production processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. In addition, certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property, or parties who arranged for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities, for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances. As a result, we may incur clean-up costs in connection with any such removal or remediation efforts, as well as other third-party claims in connection with contaminated sites. In addition, we could be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. If we, or companies or facilities we acquire or have acquired, in the past failed or in the future fail to comply with any such laws and regulations, then we could incur regulatory penalties, fines and legal 24liabilities; suspension of production; significant compliance requirements; alteration of our manufacturing, assembly or test processes; restriction on our ability to modify or expand our facilities; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. We are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We cannot make assurances that we will at all times be in compliance with such laws, regulations, rules and permits. See also the risk factor titled “Our business may suffer due to the impact of, or our failure to comply with, the various existing, new or amended laws, regulations, policies or standards to which we are subject.”Climate change concerns and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may affect us, our suppliers and our customers. Such laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, climate change could cause certain natural disasters, such as drought, wildfires, storms, flooding or rising sea levels, to occur more frequently or with greater intensity, which could pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of such facilities, and could increase or decrease temperatures resulting in increased operating costs and/or business disruption.We have manufacturing facilities in Asia and Europe, and the primary warehouses where we store finished goods are located in Asia. If tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, drought or other natural disasters, effects of climate change, acts of war or other geopolitical conflicts were to damage, destroy or disrupt any of these facilities, it could disrupt our operations, cease or delay production and shipments of inventory and result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs and lost business. In addition, natural disasters, effects of climate change, acts of war or other geopolitical conflicts may result in disruptions in transportation, distribution channels and supply chains and significant increases in the prices of raw materials. Further, health crises, including epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and government and business responses thereto, could affect our manufacturing facilities, including by resulting in quarantines and/or closures, which would result in disruptions to and potential closures of our manufacturing operations. Our manufacturing operations could also be disrupted by cyber-attacks on our IT systems, as described in the Risk Factor below titled “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.”Our manufacturing operations depend on securing raw materials, equipment and other supplies in adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner from multiple suppliers, and in some cases, we rely on a limited number of suppliers, including in some cases sole suppliers, particularly in Asia. There may be cases where supplies of raw materials, equipment and other products are interrupted or limited by natural disaster, geopolitical conflict, accident or some other event affecting a supplier or source of raw materials; supply is suspended due to quality or other issues; there is a shortage of supply due to a rapid increase in demand; and/or we or our suppliers are prohibited from utilizing certain raw materials, or products or components that incorporate such raw materials, due to government restrictions related to the countries from which such raw materials originate, and acceptable alternative suppliers, raw materials or raw materials sources are not available or not available in acceptable time frames or upon acceptable terms, among others, which could impact production and prevent us from supplying our products to our customers. If the supply-demand balance is disrupted, it may considerably increase costs of manufacturing due to increased prices we pay for raw materials. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Additionally, supply and costs of raw materials, equipment and other products may be negatively impacted by trade and/or national security protection policies, such as tariffs, or actions by governments that limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain countries or companies or that limit or prevent certain companies from transacting business with us, or trade tensions, particularly with countries in Asia. Further, it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another. A failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations.Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production, and as a result, we may not be able to deliver our products or do so in a timely, cost-effective or competitive manner. Further, to remain competitive and meet customer demand, we may be required to improve our facilities and process technologies and carry out extensive research and development, each of which may require investment of significant amounts of capital and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. From time to time, we begin to purchase equipment to meet expected customer demand in advance of any purchase orders or long-term purchase commitments. Further, we typically begin manufacturing our products using our or our customers’ forecasts of demand for our products, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates and may not be covered by long-term purchase commitments. As a result, we may incur increased inventory and manufacturing costs and/or record impairment charges to the extent anticipated sales ultimately do not materialize or are lower than expected. If we or our customers overestimate demand, or if demand is impacted by factors outside of our or our customers’ control, and such demand is not covered by a binding commitment from our customers, we may experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and/or increased excess or obsolete inventory or reserve charges, which would negatively impact our results of operations.25RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CRITICAL INFORMATION Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.Third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems, and many such attacks are increasingly more sophisticated. These attacks, which might be related to industrial, corporate or other espionage, criminal hackers or state-sponsored intrusions, include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers and networks, including those in our manufacturing operations, exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other IT infrastructure and impersonating authorized users, among others. We are also subject to ransom-style cyber-attacks, which could expose our confidential or proprietary information, request payment of money and/or impact our IT systems and cause widespread disruption to our business, including our manufacturing operations. Third parties that store and/or process our confidential information, or that provide products, software or services used in our IT infrastructure (including applications), may be subject to similar attacks, which could also result in malware being introduced into our IT infrastructure, e.g., through the third parties’ software and/or software updates. Such attacks could result in the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, as well as damage to or disruptions in our IT systems. We believe that we have a robust cybersecurity program that is aligned to international cybersecurity frameworks, and that we leverage industry best practices across people, processes and technologies in an attempt to mitigate cybersecurity threats. However, we cannot anticipate, detect, repel or implement fully effective preventative measures against all cybersecurity threats, particularly because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. As part of our cybersecurity program, we seek to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in our IT systems and software (including third party software used in our IT systems) that could be exploited by hackers or other malicious actors. However, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we may fail to identify and/or remediate such vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems or other attacks have in the past, in certain instances and to certain degrees, been successful (but have not caused significant harm), and may in the future be successful, and in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects.In addition, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, have in the past and may in the future misappropriate, wrongfully use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information. This risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire our employees. See also the Risk Factor titled “We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees, and our attempts to operate under a hybrid work model may not be successful.” Similarly, we provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees and certain of our consultants, who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors. We also provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to certain of our joint venture partners, including those affiliated with state actors and including in foreign jurisdictions where ownership restrictions may require us to take a minority ownership interest in the joint venture. Such joint venture partners may wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors. Our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information that we have provided to customers, licensees or other business partners could also be wrongfully obtained by third parties through cyber-attacks on such customers’, licensees’ or other business partners’ IT systems.The misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, cause us to lose business, damage our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings, cause us to incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our IT systems and our technology, intellectual property and proprietary and confidential information.Further, China has implemented, and other countries or regions may implement, cybersecurity laws that require our overall IT security environment to meet certain standards and/or be certified. Such laws may be complex, ambiguous and subject to interpretation, which may create uncertainty regarding compliance. As a result, our efforts to comply with such laws may be expensive and may fail, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our contracts with certain of our customers require us to obtain cybersecurity certifications for our IT systems. Failure to obtain or maintain the necessary cybersecurity certifications could result in loss of future revenues, damage to our customer relationships and reputation, and a shift of business to our competitors. 26RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENTWe may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees, and our attempts to operate under a hybrid work model may not be successful.Our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. In addition, in order to extend our business into certain new and expanded product areas and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we need to attract, retain and motivate engineering and other technical personnel with specialized skills in these areas, and these skills are in high demand among our competitors. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees or employment candidates, including by establishing or expanding local offices near our headquarters in San Diego, California. Further, the increased availability of remote working arrangements has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. A number of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and/or offer compensation in excess of what we offer or other benefits that we generally do not offer, such as the ability to permanently work from home. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed. The COVID-19 pandemic caused us to modify our workforce practices, including having the vast majority of our employees work from home. While we have generally reopened our offices, we are currently operating under a hybrid work model, meaning that the majority of our employees have the flexibility to work remotely at least some of the time. The hybrid work model may impair our ability to maintain our collaborative and innovative culture, and may cause disruptions among our employees, including decreases in productivity, challenges in communications between on-site and off-site employees and, potentially, employee dissatisfaction and attrition. Further, any future attempt to transition away from the hybrid work model to more stringent on-site work requirements may result in employee dissatisfaction and attrition. If we fail to retain key employees or maintain employee productivity as a result of the hybrid work model or an attempt to return to more on-site work, our business could be adversely impacted.RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR LICENSING BUSINESSThe continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring.We own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G, 5G and other technologies. It is critical that we continue to evolve our patent portfolio, particularly in 5G. If we do not maintain a strong portfolio that is applicable to current and future standards, products and services, our future licensing revenues could be negatively impacted.Our patent license agreements in effect that generate a significant portion of our licensing revenues are effective for a specified term. To receive royalties after the expiration date of the specified term, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. We might not be able to extend or modify license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, in the future without negatively affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees, and such modifications or new agreements may negatively impact our revenues. In some circumstances, we may extend, modify or enter into new license agreements as a result of arbitration or litigation, and terms imposed by arbitrators or courts may be less favorable to us than existing terms and may impact the financial or other terms of license agreements not subject to the litigation or arbitration. If there is a delay in extending, modifying or entering into a new license agreement with a licensee, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize revenues related to that licensee’s product sales. Further, if we are unable to reach agreement on such modifications or new agreements, it could result in patent infringement litigation with such licensees.Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business. From time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder’s ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to lower the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price on which the royalty is calculated.27In addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.We have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations” and “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.” In addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.Further, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies’) alleged failure to abide by these policies. Some SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their own.We expect that such proposals, interpretations and strategies will continue in the future, and if successful, our business model would be harmed, either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalties (or by reducing the royalties we can collect) on all or a portion of our standard-essential patent portfolio, limiting our return on investment with respect to new technologies, limiting our ability to seek injunctions against infringers of our standard-essential patents, constraining our ability to make licensing commitments when submitting our technologies for inclusion in future standards (which could make our technologies less likely to be included in such standards) or forcing us to work outside of SDOs or other industry groups to promote our new technologies, and our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, the legal and other costs associated with asserting or defending our positions have been and may in the future be significant. We expect that such challenges, regardless of their merits, will continue into the foreseeable future and will require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources.Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.As described in the Risk Factor below titled “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings,” we have been in the past, currently are and may in the future be subject to various governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings challenging our patent licensing practices. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We believe that one intent of certain of these governmental investigations and legal proceedings has been to reduce the amount of royalties that licensees are required to pay to us for their use of our intellectual property. If we were required to reduce the royalty rates in our patent license agreements, our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted absent a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid. 28Similarly, if we were required to reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated (e.g., license at the chipset level rather than at the device level), our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted unless there was a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid or we were able to increase our royalty rates to offset the decrease in revenues resulting from such lower royalty base (assuming the absolute royalty dollars were below any relevant royalty caps).If we were required to grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers (which could lead to implementing a more complex, multi-level licensing structure in which we license certain portions of our patent portfolio to chipset manufacturers and other portions to OEMs), we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, and we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed. In addition, our licensing revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain, in the aggregate, equivalent revenues under such a multi-level licensing structure.If we were required to sell chipsets to OEMs that do not have a license to our patents, our licensing programs could be negatively impacted by patent exhaustion claims raised by such unlicensed OEMs (i.e., claims that our sale of chipsets to such OEMs forecloses us from asserting any patents substantially embodied by the chipsets against such OEMs). Such sales could provide OEMs with a defense in the event we asserted our patents against them to obtain licensing revenue for those patents. This could have a material adverse effect on our licensing programs and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.To the extent that we were required to implement any of these licensing and/or business practices, including by modifying or renegotiating our existing license agreements or pursuing other commercial arrangements, we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed, and our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be harmed. The impact of any such changes to our licensing practices could vary widely and by jurisdiction, depending on the specific outcomes and the geographic scope of such outcomes. In addition, if we were required to make modifications to our licensing practices in one jurisdiction, licensees or governmental agencies in other jurisdictions may attempt to obtain similar outcomes for themselves or for such other jurisdictions, as applicable, which could result in increased legal costs and further harm to our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL CHALLENGESOur business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.We have been in the past and currently are subject to various governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” Key allegations or findings in those matters include or have in the past included, among others: that we violate FRAND licensing commitments by refusing to grant licenses to chipset manufacturers; that our royalty rates are too high; that the base on which our royalties are calculated should be something less than the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of the applicable device (minus certain permitted deductions); that we unlawfully require customers to execute a patent license before we sell them cellular modem chipsets; that we have entered into exclusive agreements with chipset customers that foreclose competition; that we leverage our position in baseband chipsets in the RFFE space; and that we violate antitrust laws and engage in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition. We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Depending on the matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others: the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patents; injunctions; monetary damages, fines or other orders to pay money; the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices, such as requiring us to reduce our royalty rates, reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers, sell chipsets to unlicensed OEMs or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreements; and determinations that some or all of our license agreements are invalid or unenforceable. In addition, a governmental body in a particular country or region may successfully assert and impose remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. If some or all of our license agreements are declared invalid or unenforceable and/or we are required to renegotiate these license agreements, we may not receive, or may not be able to recognize, some or any licensing or royalty revenues under the impacted license agreements unless and until we enter into new license agreements; and even licensees whose license agreements are not impacted may demand to renegotiate their agreements or invoke the dispute resolution provision in their agreements, and we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues under such agreements. The renegotiation of license agreements could result in terms that are less favorable to us than existing terms, or lead to arbitration or litigation to resolve the licensing terms, which could also be less favorable to us than existing terms, and each of which could take months or years. Licensees may underreport, underpay, not report or not pay royalties owed to us pending the conclusion of such negotiations, arbitration or litigation. In addition, we may be sued for alleged overpayments of past royalties paid to us, including private antitrust actions seeking treble damages under U.S. antitrust laws.The occurrence of any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and our stock price could decline, possibly significantly, in which case we may have to 29significantly cut costs and other uses of cash, including in research and development, significantly impairing our ability to maintain product and technology leadership and invest in next generation technologies. Further, depending on the breadth and severity of the circumstances above, we may have to reduce, suspend or eliminate our capital return programs, and our ability to timely pay our indebtedness may be impacted. These challenges have required, and may in the future require, the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted, and may in the future result, in significant legal costs.RISKS RELATED TO INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND COMPETITIONOur revenues depend on our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, including 5G, and customer demand for our products based on these technologies.We develop, patent and commercialize technology and products based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, which are primarily wireless. We depend on our customers and licensees to develop devices and services based on these technologies to drive consumer demand for new 3G/4G/5G multimode and single-mode devices, and to establish the selling prices for such devices. Further, the timing of our shipments of our products is dependent on the timing of our customers’ and licensees’ deployments of new devices and services based on these technologies. Increasingly, we also depend on operators of wireless networks, our customers and licensees and other third parties to incorporate these technologies into new device types and into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT, among others. Commercial deployments of 5G networks and devices have begun and are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. However, the timing and scale of such deployments, in certain regions, have been delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic and may be further delayed for reasons that are beyond our control.Our revenues and growth in revenues could be negatively impacted, our business may be harmed and our substantial investments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return, if: our customers’ and licensees’ revenues and sales of products, particularly premium-tier products, and services using these technologies, and average selling prices of such products, decline due to, for example, the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed regions, including China; we do not continue to maintain our intellectual property and technical leadership in 5G, including in ongoing 5G standardization efforts; we are unable to drive the adoption of our products into networks and devices, including devices beyond mobile handsets; or consumers’ rates of replacement of smartphones and other devices decline.Our industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change. Our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; and such change and competition could result in decreased demand for our products and technologies or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our customers or licensees.Our products and technologies face significant competition. Competition may intensify as our current competitors expand their product offerings, improve their products or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to maintain existing business and customers or attract new business and customers, as new opportunities develop, and as new competitors enter the industry. Competition in wireless communications is affected by various factors that include, among others: OEM concentrations; vertical integration; competition in certain geographic regions; government intervention or support of national industries or competitors; the ability to maintain product differentiation in light of evolving industry standards and speed of technological change (including the transition to smaller geometry process technologies and the demand for always on, always connected capabilities); access to capacity in the supply chain; and value-added features that drive selling prices and consumer demand for new 3G/4G/5G multimode and single-mode devices.We anticipate that additional competitors will introduce products as a result of growth opportunities in wireless communications, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, and technological and public policy changes. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape. For example, if any key supplier of technologies and intellectual property to the semiconductor industry was sold to one of our competitors, it could negatively affect our ability to procure or license such technologies and intellectual property in the future, at all or upon acceptable terms which could have wide-ranging impacts on our business and operations.We expect that our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:•differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features (e.g., modem, RFFE, including millimeter wave (mmWave), graphics and other processors, camera and connectivity) and with smaller geometry process technologies that drive both performance and lower power consumption;•develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points and to effectively cover all geographic regions and all device tiers;•continue to be a leader in mobile, and drive the adoption of our technologies and integrated circuit products, including RFFE, into the most popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices in mobile, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and other mobile computing devices;•increase or accelerate adoption of our technologies and products in industries and applications outside of mobile handsets, including automotive and IoT;30•maintain or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit products at the premium device tier, while also driving the adoption of our products into high, mid- and low-tier devices across all regions;•remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and develop, commercialize and remain a leading supplier of 5G integrated circuit products, including RFFE products; •maintain access to sufficient capacity in the supply chain relative to our competitors to meet customer demand;•create standalone value and contribute to the success of our existing businesses through acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions, and by developing customer, licensee, vendor, distributor and other channel relationships in new industries and applications; •identify potential acquisition targets that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic needs, reach agreement on terms acceptable to us, close the transactions and effectively integrate these new businesses, products, technologies and employees; •provide leading products and technologies to OEMs, high level operating systems (HLOS) providers, operators, cloud providers and other industry participants as competitors, new industry entrants and other factors continue to affect the industry landscape;•be a preferred partner and sustain preferred relationships providing integrated circuit products that support multiple operating system and infrastructure platforms to industry participants that effectively commercialize new devices using these platforms; and•continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in computing and other consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging regions and China.We compete with many different semiconductor companies, ranging from multinational companies with integrated research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing organizations across a broad spectrum of product lines, to companies that are focused on a single application, industry or standard product, including those that produce products for mobile handsets, automotive or IoT, among others. Most of these competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our businesses or product lines. Companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Apple, Broadcom, MediaTek, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC. Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to use our competitors’ integrated circuit products, to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, or to utilize alternative technologies; lower cost structures or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies, competitors or OEMs that sell devices that do not contain our integrated circuit products; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; the development and sale of infrastructure equipment for wireless networks, which may enable such competitors to better optimize their integrated circuit products for performance on those networks; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and OEMs in certain geographic regions (such as China); more experience in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT); and a more established presence in certain regions. In addition, certain of our largest integrated circuit customers have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize our competitors’ integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. Further, certain of those customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products (effectively making them competitors), which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).” Further, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers or suppliers; limit, prevent or discourage certain of our customers or suppliers from transacting business with us; or make it more expensive to do so. This could advantage our competitors by enabling them with increased sales, economies of scale, operating income and/or cash flows, and/or enabling critical technology transfer, allowing them to increase their investments in technology development, research and development, and commercialization of products. See also the Risk Factor titled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.”Competition in any or all product tiers may result in the loss of business or customers, which would negatively impact our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Such competition may also reduce average selling prices for our chipset products or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging regions and China where competitors may have lower cost structures or may have a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins on their products. Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without 31corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees’ products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIESFailures in our products, or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.Our products are complex and may contain defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system. Development of products in new domains of technology, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or other unintended functionality could also be introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious actors, either directly or through third-party products or software used in our products or IT infrastructure (including applications). Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use. Risks associated with product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into consumer and other devices.The use of devices containing our products to interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers’ products, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or our customers’ products or IT infrastructure. Such attacks could result in the disruption of our customers’ businesses or the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology or intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of our customers, their employees or the end users of our customers’ devices. While we continue to focus on this issue and take measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities continue to evolve, enabling more elaborate functionality and applications, and increasing the risk of security failures, and techniques used to perpetrate cybersecurity attacks are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.”Our products may be responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products and networks. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, meet certain regulatory or industry standards (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry), or other product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell to our customers, the devices into which our products are integrated and the end users of such devices, and potentially to our customers’ IT infrastructure. Such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities could give rise to significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, repairing or replacing defective products, writing down defective inventory or indemnification obligations under our agreements, and could result in the loss of sales and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, a loss of design wins, a shifting of business to our competitors, and litigation or regulatory action against us, and could harm our reputation, our relationships with customers and partners and our ability to attract new customers, as well as the perceptions of our brand. Other potential adverse impacts of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities include shipment delays, write-offs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and losses on unfavorable purchase commitments. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in the products of our customers or licensees could cause a delay or decrease in demand for the products into which our products are integrated, and thus for our products.In addition, the occurrence of defects, errors or security vulnerabilities may give rise to product liability claims, particularly if such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products or the technology we use, or the products into which they are integrated, result in personal injury or death, and could result in significant costs, expenses and losses. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant, and could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel and harm our business, even if we are successful. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question, and even though we may have indemnity from our customers, and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses. We may also be required to indemnify and/or defend our customers from product liability claims relating to our products. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate, may not cover the claims, and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results. The above is exacerbated by the fact that our products may be used, and perform critical functions, in various high-risk applications such as: automobiles, including ADAS/AD functions; cameras and artificial intelligence, including home and enterprise security; home automation, including smoke and noxious gas detectors; medical condition monitoring; location and asset tracking and management, including wearables for child safety and elderly health; robotics, including public safety drones and autonomous municipality vehicles; and extended reality (XR) for treatment of phobias or PTSD, early detection of disorders or special needs, among others.32Accordingly, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and the end users of our customers’ products. If any of these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYThe enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property and by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions.We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, international treaties and other methods, to protect our intellectual property, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and intellectual property is difficult and time consuming. The steps we have taken have not always prevented, and we cannot be certain the steps we take in the future will prevent, the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our products, technologies or intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully or as readily as U.S. laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.”Some industry participants who have a vested interest in devaluing patents in general, or standard-essential patents in particular, have mounted attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established patent laws. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any potential changes. In the United States, there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law changes, and there is current and potential future litigation regarding patents, the outcomes of which could be detrimental to our licensing business. Further, the laws in certain foreign countries in which our patents are or may be licensed, or our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including certain countries in Asia, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States. In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of any standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in the future in ways that are detrimental to our licensing programs or to the sale or use of our products or technologies.We have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property and contracts, including collecting royalties for use of our patent portfolio due to, among others: refusal by certain licensees to report and pay all or a portion of the royalties they owe to us; policies or political actions of governments, including trade protection and national security policies; challenges to our licensing practices under competition laws; adoption of mandatory licensing provisions by foreign jurisdictions; failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce judgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and challenges before competition agencies to our licensing business or the pricing and integration of additional features and functionality into our chipset products. See also the Risk Factors titled “Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business” and “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.”We have engaged in litigation and arbitration in the past and may need to further litigate or arbitrate in the future to enforce our contract and intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation or arbitration, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable (which may in turn result in other licensees either not complying with their existing license agreements or initiating litigation or arbitration), license terms (including but not limited to royalty rates for the use of our intellectual property) could be imposed that are less favorable to us than existing terms, and we could incur substantial costs. Any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Further, even a positive resolution to our enforcement efforts may take time to conclude, which may reduce our revenues and cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development, in the periods prior to conclusion. Additionally, although our license agreements generally provide us with the right to audit the books and records of licensees, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. Further, certain licensees may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their books and records. To the extent we do not aggressively enforce our rights under our license agreements, licensees may not comply with their existing license agreements, and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed companies to enter into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, other unlicensed companies may not enter into license agreements. See also the Risk Factors titled “Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business” and “Our business and 33operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.”Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business.From time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright or other intellectual property claims against us relating to our technologies or products, including those we have acquired from other companies. These claims have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation, and we are currently involved in such litigation, including those described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We may not prevail in such litigation given, among other factors, the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products were found to infringe another company’s intellectual property, we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our products, or to license such intellectual property or pay damages or other compensation to such other company (any of which could be costly). If we are unable to redesign our products, license such intellectual property used in our products or otherwise distribute our products (e.g., through a licensed supplier), we could be prohibited from making and selling our products. Similarly, our suppliers could be found to infringe another company’s intellectual property, and such suppliers could then be enjoined from providing products or services to us.In any potential dispute involving us and another company’s patents or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products sold by us, or by intellectual property provided by us to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees’ sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and/or cause product release or shipment delays, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.We may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (or on the sale of our customers’ devices using such products) or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees’ sales, causing corresponding declines in our chipset or licensing revenues.Our use of open source software may harm our business.Certain of our software and our suppliers’ software may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, and we have seen, and believe that we will continue to see, customers request that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of our products’ source code and may expose our related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of that software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Furthermore, in the course of product development, we may make contributions to third-party open source projects that could subject our intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. For example, to encourage the growth of a software ecosystem that is interoperable with our products, we may need to contribute certain implementations under the open source licensing terms that govern such projects, which may adversely impact our associated intellectual property. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property upon which our licensing programs depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Also, our use and our customers’ use of open source software may subject our products and our customers’ products to governmental and third-party scrutiny and delays in product certification, which could cause customers to view our products as less desirable than our competitors’ products.34GENERAL RISK FACTORSThe COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar health crisis, may impact our business or results of operations in the future.The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant economic uncertainty, significant declines in business and consumer confidence and global demand in the wireless industry (among others) and a global economic slowdown, which negatively affected our financial results over certain periods. Specifically, throughout most of calendar 2020 and into early calendar 2021, the decline in demand for smartphones and other consumer devices sold by our customers or licensees resulted in decreased demand for our integrated circuit products and a decrease in the royalties we earned on the licensing of our intellectual property. Similarly, during calendar 2022, spikes in COVID-19 cases in certain parts of China have led the Chinese government to impose lockdowns, which have adversely affected consumer demand in the region and may continue to impact demand in the future.The COVID-19 pandemic also caused us to modify our workforce practices, such as having the vast majority of our employees work from home. While we have generally reopened our offices and are currently operating under a hybrid work model, we could be negatively affected in the future if, among others, a significant number of our employees, or employees who perform critical functions, become ill and/or are quarantined as the result of exposure to COVID-19, or a similar health crisis, or if government policies restrict the ability of those employees to perform their critical functions. See also the Risk Factor titled “We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees, and our attempts to operate under a hybrid work model may not be successful.”The COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar health crisis that may arise in the future, could impact our business, results of operations and financial condition in the manner described above, and/or through delayed, reduced or cancelled customer orders; disruptions or delays in our supply chain; the inability of our customers or licensees to purchase or pay for our products or technologies; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; or failures by other counterparties. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or a similar health crisis, may impact our future business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are uncertain, including but not limited to the duration of the pandemic or other health crisis; spikes in cases in various geographic regions; the emergence, spread and severity of new virus or disease variants; the availability, adoption and efficacy of vaccines or other medical treatments; and government responses and other actions to limit the spread of the virus or disease or to mitigate resulting negative economic effects. We are similarly unable to predict the extent to which COVID-19 or similar health crisis may impact our customers, licensees, suppliers and other partners and their financial conditions, but adverse effects on these parties could also adversely affect us. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health crisis adversely affects our business, results of operations or financial condition, it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section.We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns. We are also susceptible to declines in global, regional and local economic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to these dynamics, among others.The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, volatile, subject to downturns and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. Periods of downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, excess or obsolete inventory adjustments or reserves, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and erosion of average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to such cyclical downturns. During such downturns, our revenues may decline, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted. We are currently seeing and expect to continue to see weakness in the macroeconomic environment (negatively impacting consumer demand for smartphones and other devices that incorporate our products and technologies) and elevated inventory levels at our customers (negatively impacting the volume of chipsets they purchase from us until such inventory is depleted). Until these conditions improve, we expect that both of these dynamics will have a negative impact on our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.A decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, such as we are currently seeing, or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or licensees, could also have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including: a decrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our customers and/or the inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties; and/or negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers’ and licensees’ ability to purchase or pay for our products and intellectual property and network operators’ ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be adversely affected, potentially leading to a reduction, cancellation or delay of orders for our products. Acts of war, terrorism or other geopolitical conflicts may also result in or contribute to declining economic conditions, disruptions to global supply chains and increased volatility in financial markets, among other effects. Further, inflationary pressure may increase our costs, including employee compensation costs, reduce demand for our products or those of our customers or licensees due to increased prices of those products, or result in employee attrition to the extent our compensation does not keep up with inflation, particularly if our competitors’ compensation does. 35Our stock price and financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock and our financial results include those identified above and throughout this Risk Factors section, as well as: volatility of the stock market in general and technology and semiconductor companies in particular; announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers or licensees, including any announcement concerning the initiation of, or any developments in, any lawsuit or governmental investigation or proceeding against us; and variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors, among others. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities, among other reasons. We are and may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s attention and our resources. Certain legal matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”Our business may suffer due to the impact of, or our failure to comply with, the various existing, new or amended laws, regulations, policies or standards to which we are subject.Our business and products, and those of our customers and licensees, are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally, as well as government policies and the specifications of international, national and regional communications standards bodies (collectively, Regulations). These include, among others, Regulations related to: patent licensing practices; antitrust, competition and competitive business practices; the flow of funds out of certain countries (e.g., China); cybersecurity; imports and exports, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce; protection of intellectual property; trade and trade protection including tariffs; foreign policy and national security; environmental protection (including climate change), health and safety; supply chain, responsible sourcing, including the use of conflict minerals, and human rights; spectrum availability and license issuance; adoption of standards; taxation; privacy and data protection; labor, employment and human capital; corporate governance; public disclosure; automotive industry safety and quality standards; and business conduct. Compliance with, or changes in the interpretation of, existing Regulations, the adoption of new Regulations, changes in the oversight of our activities by governments or standards bodies, or rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such Regulations, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See also the Risk Factors titled “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings,” “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations,” “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions,” “There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues,” and “Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.”Regulations are complex and changing (which may create uncertainty regarding compliance), are subject to varying interpretations, and their application in practice may evolve over time. As a result, our efforts to comply with Regulations may fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. Failure to comply with any Regulation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. New Regulations, or evolving interpretations thereof, may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies or procedures; may divert management time and attention to compliance activities; and may negatively impact our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions.There are risks associated with our debt.Our outstanding debt and any additional debt we incur may have negative consequences on our business, including, among others: requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, industries or the market. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to economic and political conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may be required to, among others: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend payments and/or our stock repurchase program; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such refinancing or restructuring would increase. Further, if there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt financing in the future and the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly are subject to examination of our tax returns and reports by taxing authorities in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, most notably in 36countries where we earn a routine return and the tax authorities believe substantial value-add activities are performed, as well as countries where we own intellectual property. The final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. In such case, our income tax provision, results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made could be negatively affected.Tax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United States with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as FDII (foreign-derived intangible income). Beginning in fiscal 2027, the effective tax rate for FDII increases from 13% to 16%. Further, if U.S. tax rates increase and/or the FDII deduction is eliminated or reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely (potentially materially) affected. Also, if our customers move manufacturing operations to the United States, our FDII deduction may be reduced. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to transfer pricing and continues to develop new proposals including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establishing a minimum tax on global income. These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows.Item 1B.

Legal and Regulatory ProceedingsInformation regarding legal and regulatory proceedings is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We are also engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business (for example, proceedings relating to employment matters or the initiation or defense of proceedings relating to intellectual property rights), and while there can be no assurance, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Item 4. Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable.37PART IIItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket Information and DividendsOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol “QCOM.” At October 31, 2022, there were 6,349 holders of record of our common stock. We currently intend to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital availability and requirements, including those relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales and distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, legal and regulatory risks, withholding of payments by one or more of our significant licensees and/or customers, fines and/or adverse rulings by government agencies, courts or arbitrators in legal or regulatory matters, stock repurchase programs, debt issuances, changes in federal, state or foreign income tax law, trade and/or national security protection policies, volatility in economies and financial markets or other macroeconomic conditions, and changes to our business model.Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesOur purchases of our equity securities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 were:Total Number ofShares PurchasedAverage Price Paid Per Share (1)Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or ProgramsApproximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet BePurchased Under the Plans or Programs (2)(In thousands)(In thousands)(In millions)June 27, 2022 to July 24, 2022— $— — $8,619 July 25, 2022 to August 21, 20223,366 148.53 3,366 8,119 August 22, 2022 to September 25, 2022— — — 8,119 Total3,366 3,366 (1) Average Price Paid Per Share excludes cash paid for commissions.(2) On October 12, 2021, we announced a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $10.0 billion of our common stock. At September 25, 2022, $8.1 billion remained authorized for repurchase. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Shares withheld to satisfy statutory tax withholding requirements related to the vesting of share-based awards are not issued or considered stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and, therefore, are excluded from the table above.Unregistered Sales of Equity SecuritiesIn connection with our acquisition of NuVia, Inc. (Nuvia), which closed in March 2021, we are obligated to issue shares of our common stock to three specific founders of Nuvia and certain affiliated entities of such founders from time to time upon the satisfaction of certain conditions. During the quarter ended September 25, 2022, we issued an aggregate of 106,425 additional shares of our common stock to the founders of Nuvia and their affiliates, each of whom had advised us that he or such entity was an accredited investor. These shares were issued in transactions not involving a public offering pursuant to the exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.Stock Performance GraphThe following graph compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock, the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Index (S&P 500) and the NASDAQ-100 Index (NASDAQ-100) for the five years ended September 25, 2022. The S&P 500 tracks the aggregate price performance of the equity securities of 500 United States companies selected by Standard & Poor’s Index Committee to include companies in leading industries and to reflect the United States stock market. The NASDAQ-100 tracks the aggregate price performance of the 100 largest domestic and international non-financial securities listed on the NASDAQ Stock Market based on market capitalization. Our common stock is a component of each of the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ-100.The total return for our stock and for each index assumes that $100 was invested at the market close on the last trading day for our fiscal year ended September 24, 2017 and that all dividends were reinvested.

804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the “Our Business and Operating Segments” section under the heading “Seasonality.”Corporate StructureWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.Revenue Concentrations and Significant CustomersA small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2023, revenues from Apple and Samsung each comprised 10% or more of our consolidated revenues. Additional information regarding revenue concentrations is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2. Composition of Certain Financial Statement Items” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.”Research and DevelopmentThe wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and, with the use of 5G, the expansion into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets such as automotive and IoT, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in modem, radio-frequency integrated circuit, RFFE, multimedia (camera, video, display and computer vision), sensor perception and drive policy, advanced SoC, which includes specialized engines such as CPU and GPU to enable high performance and low-power computing and other optimization techniques, AI, packaging and a broad range of other technologies. We expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products and technologies and to utilize that research and development in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT), including continuing the development of new modem and multimedia technologies and other technologies (such as ADAS/AD and XR), developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world.We continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in OFDMA-based technologies and products (including LTE, 5G and 6G). We also engage in acquisitions and other transactions to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or open or expand opportunities for our technologies and to support the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhance existing products and services) for voice and data communications and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as ADAS/AD. We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops, voice and music devices, wearable devices and XR devices) and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G, 4G and 5G technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, position location and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other client software environments in our chipsets.We conduct broad, leading research and development across AI, including generative AI, from fundamental research to platform and applied research, with the goal of advancing its core capabilities (i.e., perception, reasoning and action), and scaling them across industries and use cases. With investments made in AI for over a decade, our research is diverse, and we are focused on power efficiency and personalization to make AI seamless across our everyday experiences. 14We develop innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition. We are focused on making it easier for developers to design and deploy their applications on our platforms across multiple device categories and industries as a part of our diversification strategy.We have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world that support our global development activities and ongoing efforts to develop and/or advance 4G, 5G, 6G, and a broad range of other technologies, including RFFE. We continue to use our substantial engineering resources and expertise to develop new technologies, applications and services and make them available to licensees to help grow the wireless communications industry and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities.Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human CapitalWe believe that our innovations help transform industries, enhance people’s lives and address some of society’s biggest challenges. With the world becoming increasingly connected, we have an opportunity to shape a better future. We believe in the power of technology. As such, our corporate responsibility vision is to be a facilitator of innovation for a sustainable world, connected wirelessly.We have integrated corporate responsibility throughout our business, from our daily operations to our executive leadership and our Board of Directors (Board). The Governance Committee of our Board provides oversight on ESG matters not delegated to other Board committees, including ESG policies, programs and initiatives. The HR and Compensation Committee of our Board provides oversight on our human capital initiatives and our workforce diversity, equity and inclusion policies, programs and initiatives, while the Audit Committee of our Board provides oversight of our ESG disclosure controls and procedures. Our ESG Leadership Committee, composed of certain executives, provides guidance on global corporate responsibility issues. Our ESG Working Group implements directives from the ESG Leadership Committee, measures progress on achieving our goals and reports to management on accomplishments and challenges.ESGWe center our ESG efforts around purposeful innovation, focusing on three strategic areas where we believe we can have the biggest impact:•Empowering Digital Transformation. We believe technology can transform industries, businesses, communities and individual lives. We invent solutions that are foundational to the advancement of the global wireless ecosystem, improving how we work, live and, ultimately, thrive. •Acting Responsibly. We invest in our people, strive to always behave with integrity and implement governance standards that uphold Qualcomm’s values. We are committed to responsible business practices, from upholding diversity, equity and inclusion, to protecting privacy, to providing leading development programs and fostering an ethical culture.•Operating Sustainably. We aim to maintain safe, healthy and productive working conditions and conserve natural resources. Our environmental efforts center on reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, optimizing energy consumption, managing water usage and minimizing waste throughout our operations and the communities in which we work. 2025 Goals. Our 2025 Goals related to corporate responsibility include, among others:•Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 30% from global operations, from a 2014 base year.•Reducing power consumption by 10% every year in our flagship Snapdragon Mobile Platform products (given equivalent features).•Ensuring 100% of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers are audited every 2-years for conformance to our Supplier Code of Conduct, from a 2020 base year.Net-Zero Global GHG Emissions Commitment. Qualcomm has approved near and long-term science-based emissions reduction targets with the Science Based Targets Initiative (SBTi), including: (1) reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 from a 2020 base year; (2) reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 from a 2020 base year; and (3) reach net-zero GHG emissions across the value chain by 2040.The foregoing discussion includes information regarding ESG matters that we believe may be of interest to our stockholders generally. We recognize that certain other stakeholders (such as customers, employees and non-governmental organizations), as well as certain of our stockholders, may be interested in more detailed information on these topics. We encourage you to review our most recent Qualcomm Corporate Responsibility Report (located on our website) for more detailed information regarding our Corporate Responsibility and ESG governance, goals, priorities, accomplishments and initiatives, as well as the Corporate Governance section of our most recent Proxy Statement, and our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices (located on our website), for additional information regarding governance matters, including Board 15and Committee leadership, oversight, roles and responsibilities, and Director independence, tenure, refreshment and diversity. Nothing on our website, including the aforementioned reports and documents, or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.Human CapitalIn order to continue to produce innovative, breakthrough technologies, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Qualcomm a diverse, inclusive, and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits, and health and wellness programs and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.At September 24, 2023, we had approximately 50,000 full-time, part-time and temporary workers, the overwhelming majority of which were full-time employees. Our employees are represented by more than 100 (self-identified) nationalities working in over 150 locations in 36 different countries around the world. Collectively, we speak more than 90 different languages. Our global workforce is highly educated, with the substantial majority of our employees working in engineering or technical roles. During fiscal 2023, our voluntary turnover rate was less than 5%. During the second half of fiscal 2023, in order to promote and facilitate the type of collaboration and innovation that is foundational to Qualcomm, we adjusted our onsite work policy to require most of our employees to be in the office the majority of their working time.Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. We believe that a diverse workforce is important to our success, and we continue to focus on making Qualcomm a great place to work for women and underrepresented populations. Our recent efforts have been focused in three areas: inspiring innovation through an inclusive and diverse culture; expanding our efforts to recruit world-class diverse talent; and identifying strategic partners to accelerate our inclusion, equity and diversity programs. We have employee networks that enhance our inclusive and diverse culture, including global network groups focused on supporting women, LGBTQ+ employees and employees with disabilities, in addition to U.S.-based employee networks that focus on Black and African American employees, Hispanic and Latinx employees and U.S. military members and veterans. In 2023, we also added a new employee network to support Asian American and Pacific Islander employees.We continue to recruit technical talent in diverse communities, engaging as a high-level sponsor of professional conferences, such as the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers National Convention and the National Society of Black Engineers National Convention. We also continue to recruit from a variety of colleges with diverse student populations, including Hispanic-Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Our continued engagement with organizations that work with diverse communities has been vital to our efforts. We joined the Global Catalyst Community that helps organizations build workplaces that work for women with thought leadership and actionable solutions to advance women into leadership. We are also endorsed as a great employer for women by Work180 and have been recognized by Avtar and Seramount as a Best Company for Women in India. We, alongside other top technology companies, helped form the Reboot Representation Tech Coalition, which aims to double the number of Black, Latinx and Native American women receiving computing degrees by 2025.

Risk FactorsYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects, any of which could negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. Further, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. In such cases, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” References to “and,” “or” and “and/or” should be read to include the others, as appropriate. RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSESWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. The mobile industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Certain Chinese OEMs have increased and may continue to increase their device share in China and in certain regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. See also “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 2. Composition of Certain Financial Statement Items - Concentrations.” In addition, a number of our largest customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products, or may choose our competitors’ integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently 18utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products, which could significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).”Further, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.”In addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers’ feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.The loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by any of these customers or the cancellation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors’ integrated circuit products, government restrictions, a decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, a decline in consumer demand (or a shift in consumer demand away from new devices in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices), elevated inventory levels at our customers or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations. A delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development. Further, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products, which could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers’ new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate. Apple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.The mobile industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles. A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, or a shift in consumer demand in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development. Further, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration. Although we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the success of our core licensing business depends in part on the ability of our licensees to continue to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful in these efforts. Reductions in sales of our licensees’ products, or reductions in the average selling prices of such products without a sufficient increase in the volumes sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues. Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).Certain of our largest customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and we expect will in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).19Apple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors’ products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel’s modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices. Similarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.”In addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.If our customers begin using their own integrated circuit products rather than our products in some or all of their devices, or increase their use of their own integrated circuit products from current levels, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled “We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.”A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in devices they sell into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.Due to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (including its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices, or use our competitors’ integrated circuit products in their devices, rather than our products, which could materially harm our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).”Political actions, including trade protection and national security policies of the U.S. and Chinese governments, such as tariffs, bans or placing companies on restricted entity lists, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers, limit, prevent or discourage certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so. Given our revenue concentration in China, if, due to actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies: we were further limited in, or prohibited from, selling our integrated circuit products to Chinese customers; our non-Chinese OEM customers were limited in, or prohibited from, selling devices that incorporate our integrated circuit products into China; Chinese OEMs develop and use their own integrated circuit products or use our competitors’ integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices rather than our integrated circuit products; Chinese tariffs on our integrated circuit products or on devices which incorporate our integrated circuit products made purchasing such products or devices more expensive to our Chinese customers or Chinese consumers; or our Chinese licensees delay or cease making payments of license fees they owe us, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. Similarly, if, due to U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, we were limited in or prohibited from obtaining critical integrated circuit products from our suppliers in China, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. See also the Risk Factors titled “We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier handset devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected” and “Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).”For example, we currently have export licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce that allow us to sell 4G and other integrated circuit products, including Wi-Fi products, but excluding 5G products, to Huawei. Recent news reports have indicated that the Department of Commerce is considering not granting any new licenses for sales to Huawei and potentially revoking existing licenses. Further, we do not have a license to sell 5G products to Huawei, and Huawei has recently announced the launch of new 5G-capable devices using its own integrated circuit products. As a result, we do not expect to receive material product revenues from Huawei going forward. Additionally, to the extent that Huawei’s 5G devices take share from Chinese OEMs that utilize our 5G products or from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our 5G products in devices they sell into China, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be further impacted. 20Finally, government policies in China that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of the country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of, and/or ability to receive, payments from our customers and licensees in China, which may negatively impact our cash flows.RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVESOur growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.While we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 5G-based technologies, we also invest in new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, by utilizing our existing technical and business expertise and through acquisitions or other strategic transactions.In particular, our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies and products for these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; and third parties incorporating our technologies and products into devices used in these product areas, industries and applications. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and in developing related products and technologies. Our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent 5G and next-generation wireless technologies, and to develop and commercialize products using these technologies.However, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and corresponding technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products and new technologies in mobile handsets, may not succeed because, among other reasons: we may not be issued patents on the technologies we develop; the technologies we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standards; new and expanded product areas, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, and consumer demand therein, may not develop or grow as anticipated; we may be unable to attract or retain employees with the necessary skills in such new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; our strategies or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be successful; alternate technologies or products may be better or may reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors’ technologies or products may be more cost effective, have more capabilities or fewer limitations or be brought to market faster than our new technologies or products; we may not be able to develop, or our competitors may have more established and/or stronger, customer, vendor, distributor or other channel relationships; and competitors may have longer operating histories in industries and applications that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of, or overestimate the future revenues or margins that could result from, these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns. For example, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in significant barriers to entry and increased costs. Additionally, certain customers have adopted, and other customers may adopt, policies that require us to achieve certain sustainability, climate or other environmental, social and governance (ESG)-related targets, such as our 2040 net-zero global GHG emissions commitment and our interim GHG emissions reduction goals. If we fail to achieve ESG-related targets that meet our customers’ requirements or expectations, these customers may not purchase products or services from us. If our products fail to perform to specifications, compete with the product quality of our competitors or meet quality or regulatory standards (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry) or other standards (including sustainability or other ESG-related standards) of a particular industry or application, we may be unable to successfully expand our business in that industry or application, and our growth could be limited.In addition, in order to successfully extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we may need to transition to new business models or transform aspects of our organization, and we may not be successful in doing so.If we are not successful in extending our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, if our new technologies and products are not successful, or if we are not successful in the time frames we anticipate, we may incur significant costs and asset impairments, our business and revenues may not grow or grow as anticipated, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted, our stock price may decline and our reputation may be harmed.We may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.We engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions, including joint ventures, and make investments, which we believe are important to the future of our business. We routinely acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions, and purchase minority equity 21interests in or make loans to companies, including those that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our products and technologies, supporting the design and introduction of new products (or enhancing existing products) for mobile handsets, and furthering our growth and diversification strategy in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Many of our strategic activities entail a high degree of risk and require the use of significant amounts of capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not be successful, generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or products. We may underestimate the costs or overestimate the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership or variable interests. In addition, we have in the past recorded, and may in the future record, impairment or other charges related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited.Achieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, facilities, technology, products, processes, operations (including supply and manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers and suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not derive any commercial value from acquired technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these technologies, and we may become subject to liabilities, including liabilities arising as a result of litigation, that are not covered by any indemnification protection that we may obtain. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sales or distribution channels, business or operational models, geographic regions, industries and applications served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of our strategic acquisitions.Many of our acquisitions and other strategic investments require approval by the United States and/or foreign government agencies. Certain agencies in the past have, and may in the future, deny the transaction or fail to approve in a timely manner, resulting in us not realizing the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction. Future acquisitions or other strategic investments may be more difficult, complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to consummate acquisitions has been or is in the future harmed. Further, if U.S./China relations remain strained, our ability to consummate any transaction that would require approval from the relevant regulatory agency(ies) in China may be severely impacted. In addition, acquisitions that we have completed could subsequently be reviewed and/or challenged by government agencies, which could result in fines, penalties or other liability, or requirements to divest all or a portion of an acquired business.If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions or other strategic activities, or if we are unable to consummate acquisitions or strategic investments that we consider important to the future of our business, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, our growth and diversification strategy may not be successful, our stock price may decline and our reputation may be harmed.RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.We primarily utilize a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Other than the facilities we own that manufacture certain of our RFFE modules and RF (radio frequency) filter products, we rely on third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. There are a limited number of such third-party suppliers, and even fewer who are capable of manufacturing at the leading process technology nodes, or who are willing to operate at older process technology nodes necessary for certain of our integrated circuit products. The semiconductor manufacturing foundries that supply our products are primarily located in Asia, as are the primary warehouses where we store finished goods for fulfillment of customer orders.The following issues related to our third-party suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively impact our revenues, business operations, profitability and cash flows:•our suppliers’ failure or inability to react to shifts in product demand, including situations where demand for integrated circuits exceeds suppliers’ capacity to meet that demand;22•a failure or inability by our suppliers to procure raw materials or allocate adequate raw materials for our products, or an increase in prices for raw materials or components;•an inability to procure or utilize raw materials, components or products from our suppliers due to government prohibitions or restrictions on transactions with certain countries and/or companies, and alternative suppliers, raw material sources or raw materials are not available or not available in acceptable time frames or upon acceptable terms;•a failure by our suppliers to allocate adequate manufacturing, assembly or test capacity for our products;•our suppliers’ failure or inability to develop or maintain, or a delay in developing or building out, manufacturing capacity for leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies;•the loss of a supplier or the failure or inability of a supplier to meet performance, quality or yield specifications or delivery schedules; •additional expense or production delays as a result of qualifying a new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of, or a decision to add or change, a supplier;•natural disasters, the effects of climate change, acts of war or other geopolitical conflicts impacting the regions in which our suppliers and their manufacturing foundries or assembly, test or other facilities are located; •health crises, including epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and government and business responses thereto, which impact our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines or closures; •cyber-attacks on our suppliers’ information technology (IT) systems, including those related to their manufacturing foundries or assembly, test or other facilities;•trade or national security protection policies, particularly U.S. or Chinese government policies, that limit or prevent us from transacting business with suppliers of critical integrated circuit products, or that limit or prevent such suppliers from transacting business with us or from procuring materials, machinery or technology necessary to manufacture goods for us; and•any other reduction, interruption, delay or limitation in our product supply sources.We rely on sole- or limited-source suppliers for certain products, which may exacerbate the risks identified above, and subject us to other significant risks, including poor product performance and reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing capability and yields, quality assurance, quantity and costs. While we have established and may in the future establish alternate suppliers for certain products, these suppliers may require significant amounts of time and levels of support to bring such products to production, both of which may increase for complex or leading process technologies. As a result, we may invest a significant amount of effort and resources and incur higher costs to support and maintain such alternate suppliers. Further, the elimination or limitation of a foundry supplier’s ability to manufacture components or products for us due to trade or national security protection policies could increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and limit or prevent us from procuring critical components or products from those suppliers. Future consolidation of foundry suppliers could also increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and reduce our suppliers’ willingness to negotiate pricing, which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reductions, increase our manufacturing costs and limit the amount of capacity available to us. Our arrangements with our suppliers may obligate us to incur costs to manufacture, assemble and test our products that do not decrease at the same rate as decreases in pricing to our customers. Our ability, and that of our suppliers, to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies (which adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability), and to effectively compete with the manufacturing processes and performance of our competitors, could impact our ability to introduce new products and meet customer demand, could increase our costs (possibly decreasing our margins) and could subject us to the risk of excess inventories. Any of the above could negatively impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.Although we have long-term contracts with our suppliers, some of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific quantity, our suppliers may allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the manufacture, assembly and testing of products for their other customers (including our competitors) while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture, assemble or test our products, and such capacity may be limited based on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to invest in the capital required to manufacture in the leading process technologies. Our suppliers or potential alternate suppliers may also manufacture their own integrated circuits that compete with our products. Such suppliers have in the past allocated and may again allocate raw materials and manufacturing capacity to their own products and reduce or limit the production of our products. To the extent we do obtain long-term capacity commitments, we may incur additional costs related to those commitments or make non-refundable payments for capacity commitments that are not used. Further, certain of our suppliers have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to unilaterally reduce their capacity commitments to us. Accordingly, capacity for our products may not be available when we need it. Finally, we may not receive reasonable pricing, manufacturing or delivery terms from our suppliers, and our ability to obtain favorable terms may be diminished during times of high demand and/or limited manufacturing capacity for integrated circuit products.23We cannot guarantee that the actions of our suppliers will not cause disruptions in our operations that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers or increase our cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to obtain adequate supply to meet our delivery obligations, we may be obligated to make payments to our customers for such shortfalls. From time to time, the global semiconductor industry experiences demand for integrated circuits that exceeds the industry’s capacity to meet that demand. Our ability to meet increased demand for our products has been in the past and may in the future be limited due to the inability to obtain the additional manufacturing, assembly and test capacity necessary to fully meet such demand. If we are unable to fully meet customer demand, this could result in lost sales opportunities, reduced revenue growth and harm to our customer relationships. These issues may be exacerbated if customers overstate their expected demand requirements in order to procure additional supply, which could negatively impact our ability to forecast and to allocate supply appropriately among our customers. The above issues may also be exacerbated with respect to our platform solutions, which already entail a great deal of complexity due to differing lead-times, technologies and suppliers for each integrated circuit product included in such solutions. Additionally, our suppliers have in the past and may in the future increase their prices during periods of capacity constraints, or for other reasons, thus increasing our costs.While capacity constraints have largely abated, we expect to continue to see product cost increases from certain of our key semiconductor wafer suppliers, which, without corresponding increases in the prices of our products, could negatively impact our margins.We place orders with our suppliers using our and our customers’ forecasts of demand for our products, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates. As we move to smaller geometry process technologies, the manufacturing lead-time increases. As a result, the orders we place with our suppliers are generally only partially covered by commitments from our customers. If we, or our customers, overestimate demand, or if demand is impacted by factors outside of our or our customers’ control, and such demand is not covered by a binding commitment from our customers, we may experience increased excess or obsolete inventory or reserve charges, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Further, to the extent our customers procure supply of our integrated circuit products beyond their current needs (i.e., build up inventory of our integrated circuit products), whether due to concerns over supply, overestimating demand and/or a decline in macroeconomic conditions, or otherwise, they may not purchase expected quantities of our products in subsequent quarters, which may negatively impact our revenues, results of operations and cash flows in such quarters.See also the Risk Factor below titled “There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues” as similar risks, as well as additional risks, may be applicable to our third-party suppliers’ manufacturing facilities, which could result in disruptions to our business or additional costs to us, and negatively impact our results of operations.There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues.We operate various facilities that manufacture certain of our RFFE modules and RF filter products. Our manufacturing facilities are characterized by a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model. We may be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products, including in less favorable industry or macroeconomic environments, or due to our failure to win and/or retain designs with OEMs. As a result, from time to time our manufacturing facilities operate at lower capacity levels, while the fixed costs associated with such facilities continue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit. Due to the factors above, we are currently experiencing, and expect to continue to experience in the near term, such underutilization of capacity at our manufacturing facilities. We are subject to many complex environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and rules in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing (and research and development) facilities. The regulatory landscape in these areas continues to evolve, and we anticipate additional laws, regulations and rules in the future. In particular, new, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules, including relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could lead to new or additional investments in production processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. In addition, certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property, or parties who arranged for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities, for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances. As a result, we may incur clean-up costs in connection with any such removal or remediation efforts, as well as other third-party claims in connection with contaminated sites. In addition, we could be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. If we, or companies or facilities we acquire or have acquired, in the past failed or in the future fail to comply with any such laws and regulations, then we could incur regulatory penalties, fines and legal liabilities; suspension of production; significant compliance requirements; alteration of our manufacturing, assembly or test processes; restriction on our ability to modify or expand our facilities; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. We are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We cannot make assurances that we will at all times be in compliance with such laws, regulations, rules and permits. See also the risk factor titled “Our business may suffer due to the impact of, or our failure to comply with, the various existing, new or amended laws, regulations, policies or standards to which we are subject.”24Climate change concerns and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may affect us, our suppliers and our customers. Such laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, climate change could cause certain natural disasters, such as drought, wildfires, storms, flooding or rising sea levels, to occur more frequently or with greater intensity, which could pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of such facilities, and could increase or decrease temperatures resulting in increased operating costs and/or business disruption.We have manufacturing facilities in Asia and Europe, and the primary warehouses where we store finished goods are located in Asia. If tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, drought or other natural disasters, effects of climate change, acts of war or other geopolitical conflicts were to damage, destroy or disrupt any of these facilities, it could disrupt our operations, cease or delay production and shipments of inventory and result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs and lost business. In addition, natural disasters, effects of climate change, acts of war or other geopolitical conflicts may result in disruptions in transportation, distribution channels and supply chains and significant increases in the prices of raw materials. Further, health crises, including epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and government and business responses thereto, could affect our manufacturing facilities, including by resulting in quarantines and/or closures, which could result in disruptions to and potential closures of our manufacturing operations. Our manufacturing operations could also be disrupted by cyber-attacks on our IT systems, as described in the Risk Factor below titled “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.”Our manufacturing operations depend on securing raw materials, equipment and other supplies in adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner from multiple suppliers, and in some cases, we rely on a limited number of suppliers, including in some cases sole suppliers, particularly in Asia. There may be cases where supplies of raw materials, equipment and other products are interrupted or limited by natural disaster, geopolitical conflict, accident or some other event affecting a supplier or source of raw materials; supply is suspended due to quality or other issues; there is a shortage of supply due to a rapid increase in demand; and/or we or our suppliers are prohibited from utilizing certain raw materials, or products or components that incorporate such raw materials, due to government restrictions related to the countries from which such raw materials originate, and acceptable alternative suppliers, raw materials or raw materials sources are not available or not available in acceptable time frames or upon acceptable terms, among others, which could impact production and prevent us from supplying our products to our customers. If the supply-demand balance is disrupted, it may considerably increase costs of manufacturing due to increased prices we pay for raw materials. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Additionally, supply and costs of raw materials, equipment and other products may be negatively impacted by trade and/or national security protection policies, such as tariffs, or actions by governments that limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain countries or companies or that limit or prevent certain companies from transacting business with us, or trade tensions, particularly with countries in Asia. Further, it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another. A failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations.Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production, and as a result, we may not be able to deliver our products or do so in a timely, cost-effective or competitive manner. Further, to remain competitive and meet customer demand, we may be required to improve our facilities and process technologies and carry out extensive research and development, each of which may require investment of significant amounts of capital and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. From time to time, we purchase equipment to meet expected customer demand in advance of any purchase orders or long-term purchase commitments. Further, we typically begin manufacturing our products using our or our customers’ forecasts of demand for our products, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates and may not be covered by long-term purchase commitments. As a result, we may incur increased inventory and manufacturing costs and/or record impairment charges to the extent anticipated sales ultimately do not materialize or are lower than expected. If we or our customers overestimate demand, or if demand is impacted by factors outside of our or our customers’ control, and such demand is not covered by a binding commitment from our customers, we may experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and/or increased excess or obsolete inventory or reserve charges, which would negatively impact our results of operations.25RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CRITICAL INFORMATION Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.Third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems, and many such attacks are increasingly more sophisticated. These attacks, which might be related to industrial, corporate or other espionage, criminal hackers or state-sponsored intrusions, include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers and networks, including those in our manufacturing operations, exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other IT infrastructure and impersonating authorized users, among others. We are also subject to ransom-style cyber-attacks, which could expose our confidential or proprietary information, demand payment of money and/or impact our IT systems and cause widespread disruption to our business, including our manufacturing operations. Third parties that store and/or process our confidential information, or that provide products, software or services used in our IT infrastructure, may be subject to similar attacks, which could also result in malware being introduced into our IT infrastructure, e.g., through the third parties’ software and/or software updates. Such attacks could result in the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, as well as damage to or disruptions in our IT systems. We believe that we have a robust cybersecurity program that is aligned to international cybersecurity frameworks, and that we leverage industry best practices across people, processes and technologies in an attempt to mitigate cybersecurity threats. However, we cannot anticipate, detect, repel or implement fully effective preventative measures against all cybersecurity threats, particularly because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. For example, as AI continues to evolve, cyber-attackers could also use AI to develop malicious code and sophisticated phishing attempts. As part of our cybersecurity program, we seek to identify and remediate vulnerabilities in our IT systems and software (including third party software used in our IT systems) that could be exploited by hackers or other malicious actors. However, we may not be aware of all such vulnerabilities, and we may fail to identify and/or remediate such vulnerabilities before they are exploited. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems or other attacks have in the past, in certain instances and to certain degrees, been successful (but have not caused significant harm), and may in the future be successful, and in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. In addition, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, have in the past and may in the future misappropriate, wrongfully use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information. This risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire our employees. See also the Risk Factor titled “We may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees.” Similarly, we provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees and certain of our consultants, who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors. We also provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to certain of our joint venture partners, including those affiliated with state actors and including in foreign jurisdictions where ownership restrictions may require us to take a minority ownership interest in the joint venture. Such joint venture partners may wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors. Our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information that we have provided to customers, licensees or other business partners could also be wrongfully obtained by third parties through cyber-attacks on such customers’, licensees’ or other business partners’ IT systems.The misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, cause us to lose business, damage our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings, cause us to incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our IT systems, and our technology, intellectual property and proprietary and confidential information.Further, certain countries in which we operate have implemented, and other countries or regions may implement, cybersecurity laws that require our overall IT security environment to meet certain standards and/or be certified. Such laws may be complex, ambiguous and subject to interpretation, which may create uncertainty regarding compliance. As a result, our efforts to comply with such laws may be expensive and may fail, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our contracts with certain of our customers require us to obtain cybersecurity certifications for our IT systems. Failure to obtain or maintain the necessary cybersecurity certifications could result in loss of future revenues, damage to our customer relationships and reputation, and a shift of business to our competitors.26RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENTWe may not be able to attract or retain qualified employees.Our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. In addition, in order to extend our business into certain new and expanded product areas and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we need to attract, retain and motivate engineering and other technical personnel with specialized skills in these areas, and these skills are in high demand among our competitors. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees or employment candidates, including by establishing or expanding local offices near our headquarters in San Diego, California. Further, the increased availability of remote working arrangements has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. A number of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and/or offer compensation in excess of what we offer or other benefits that we do not offer. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller. The COVID-19 pandemic caused us to modify our workforce practices, including having the vast majority of our employees work from home. Upon the reopening of our offices, we initially operated under a hybrid work model, meaning that the majority of our employees had the flexibility to work remotely at least some of the time. In fiscal 2023, we implemented changes to our hybrid work model that require the majority of our employees to spend the majority of their working time in the office. This requirement for greater in-office attendance may not meet the needs or expectations of our employees and could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees, particularly if it is perceived as less favorable compared to other companies’ remote work policies. If we are unable to attract or retain qualified employees or fail to maintain employee productivity due to any of the factors described above or for other reasons, our business could be adversely impacted. RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR LICENSING BUSINESSThe continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring.We own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G, 5G and other technologies. It is critical that we continue to evolve our patent portfolio, particularly in 5G. If we do not maintain a strong portfolio that is applicable to current and future standards, products and services, our future licensing revenues could be negatively impacted.Our patent license agreements in effect that generate a significant portion of our licensing revenues are effective for a specified term. To receive royalties after the expiration date of the specified term, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. We might not be able to extend or modify license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, in the future without negatively affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees, and such modifications or new agreements may negatively impact our revenues. In some circumstances, we may extend, modify or enter into new license agreements as a result of arbitration or litigation, and terms imposed by arbitrators or courts may be less favorable to us than existing terms, and may impact the financial or other terms of license agreements not subject to the litigation or arbitration. If there is a delay in extending, modifying or entering into a new license agreement with a licensee, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize revenues related to that licensee’s product sales. Further, if we are unable to reach agreement on such modifications or new agreements, it could result in patent infringement litigation with such licensees.Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business. From time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder’s ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to make royalty collection more difficult or reduce the amount of royalties collected.27In addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.We have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations” and “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.” In addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.Further, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies’) alleged failure to abide by these policies. Some SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their own. In addition, governments may enact policies concerning standard-essential patents, such as the European Commission’s recently proposed regulations which would create a new regulatory scheme for standard-essential patents, that may have various consequences, some of which may be detrimental, such as by devaluing standard-essential patents or disrupting worldwide technology standards. Other jurisdictions may adopt similar regulatory schemes, which could also have such effects. We expect that such proposals, interpretations and strategies will continue in the future, and if successful, our business model would be harmed, either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalties (or by reducing the royalties we can collect) on all or a portion of our standard-essential patent portfolio, limiting our return on investment with respect to new technologies, limiting our ability to seek injunctions against infringers of our standard-essential patents, constraining our ability to make licensing commitments when submitting our technologies for inclusion in future standards (which could make our technologies less likely to be included in such standards) or forcing us to work outside of SDOs or other industry groups to promote our new technologies, and our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, the legal and other costs associated with asserting or defending our positions have been and may in the future be significant. We expect that such challenges, regardless of their merits, will continue into the foreseeable future and will require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources.Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.As described in the Risk Factor below titled “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings,” we have been in the past, currently are and may in the future be subject to various governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings challenging our patent licensing practices. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and 28Contingencies.” We believe that one intent of certain of these governmental investigations and legal proceedings has been to reduce the amount of royalties that licensees are required to pay to us for their use of our intellectual property. If we were required to reduce the royalty rates in our patent license agreements, our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted absent a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid. Similarly, if we were required to reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated (e.g., license at the chipset level rather than at the device level), our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted unless there was a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid or we were able to increase our royalty rates to offset the decrease in revenues resulting from such lower royalty base.If we were required to grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers or other component suppliers (which could lead to implementing a more complex, multi-level licensing structure in which we license certain portions of our patent portfolio to chipset manufacturers or other component suppliers and other portions to OEMs), we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, and we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed. In addition, our licensing revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain, in the aggregate, equivalent revenues under such a multi-level licensing structure.If we were required to sell chipsets to OEMs that do not have a license to our patents, our licensing programs could be negatively impacted by patent exhaustion claims raised by such unlicensed OEMs (i.e., claims that our sale of chipsets to such OEMs forecloses us from asserting any patents substantially embodied by the chipsets against such OEMs). Such sales could provide OEMs with a defense in the event we asserted our patents against them to obtain licensing revenue for those patents. Moreover, such a requirement could negatively impact our ability to maintain our licensing program for products that do not use our chipsets. This could have a material adverse effect on our licensing programs and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.To the extent that we were required to implement any of these licensing and/or business practices, including by modifying or renegotiating our existing license agreements or pursuing other commercial arrangements, we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed, and our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be harmed. The impact of any such changes to our licensing practices could vary widely and by jurisdiction, depending on the specific outcomes and the geographic scope of such outcomes. In addition, if we were required to make modifications to our licensing practices in one jurisdiction, licensees or governmental agencies in other jurisdictions may attempt to obtain similar outcomes for themselves or for such other jurisdictions, as applicable, which could result in increased legal costs and further harm to our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL CHALLENGESOur business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.We have been in the past and currently are subject to various governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” Key allegations or findings in those matters include or have in the past included, among others: that we violate FRAND licensing commitments by refusing to grant licenses to chipset manufacturers; that our royalty rates are too high; that the base on which our royalties are calculated should be something less than the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of the applicable device (minus certain permitted deductions); that we unlawfully require customers to execute a patent license before we sell them cellular modem chipsets; that we have entered into exclusive agreements with chipset customers that foreclose competition; that we leverage our position in baseband chipsets in the RFFE space; and that we violate antitrust laws and engage in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition. We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Depending on the matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others: the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patents; injunctions; monetary damages, fines or other orders to pay money; the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices, such as requiring us to reduce our royalty rates, reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers or other component suppliers, sell chipsets to unlicensed OEMs or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreements; and determinations that some or all of our license agreements are invalid or unenforceable. In addition, a governmental body in a particular country or region may successfully assert and impose remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. If some or all of our license agreements are declared invalid or unenforceable and/or we are required to renegotiate these license agreements, we may not receive, or may not be able to recognize, some or any licensing or royalty revenues under the impacted license agreements unless and until we enter into new license agreements; and even licensees whose license agreements are not impacted may demand to renegotiate their agreements or invoke the dispute resolution provision in their agreements, and we may not be able to recognize some or any revenues under such agreements. The renegotiation of license agreements could result in terms that are less favorable to us than existing terms, or lead to arbitration or litigation to resolve the licensing terms, which could also be less favorable to us than existing terms, and each of which could take months or years. Licensees may underreport, underpay, not report or not pay royalties owed to us pending the conclusion of such 29negotiations, arbitration or litigation. In addition, we may be sued for alleged overpayments of past royalties paid to us, including private antitrust actions seeking treble damages under U.S. antitrust laws. The occurrence of any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and our stock price could decline, possibly significantly, in which case we may have to significantly cut costs and other uses of cash, including in research and development, significantly impairing our ability to maintain product and technology leadership and invest in next generation technologies. Further, depending on the breadth and severity of the circumstances above, we may have to reduce, suspend or eliminate our capital return programs, and our ability to timely pay our indebtedness may be impacted.These challenges have required, and may in the future require, the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted, and may in the future result, in significant legal costs.RISKS RELATED TO INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND COMPETITIONOur revenues depend on our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, including 5G, and customer demand for our products based on these technologies.We develop, patent and commercialize technology and products based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, which are primarily wireless. We depend on our customers and licensees to develop devices and services based on these technologies to drive consumer demand for such devices, and to establish the selling prices for such devices (which impact the amount of royalties we receive for certain devices). Further, the timing of our shipments of our products is dependent on the timing of our customers’ and licensees’ deployments of new devices and services based on these technologies. Increasingly, we also depend on operators of wireless networks, our customers and licensees and other third parties to incorporate these technologies into new device types and into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT, among others. Commercial deployments of 5G networks and devices have begun and are expected to continue for the foreseeable future. However, the timing and scale of certain such deployments were delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and future deployments may similarly be delayed for reasons that are beyond our control.Our revenues and growth in revenues could be negatively impacted, our business may be harmed and our substantial investments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return, if: our customers’ and licensees’ revenues and sales of products, particularly premium-tier handset products, and services using these technologies, or average selling prices of such products, decline due to, for example, the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed regions, including China; we do not continue to maintain our intellectual property and technical leadership in 5G, including in ongoing 5G standardization efforts; we are unable to drive the adoption of our products into networks and devices, including devices beyond mobile handsets; consumers’ rates of replacement of smartphones and other devices decline; or there is a shift in consumer demand away from new devices in favor of refurbished or secondhand devices. Our industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change. Our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; and such change and competition could result in decreased demand for our products and technologies or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our customers or licensees.Our products and technologies face significant competition. Competition may intensify as our current competitors expand their product offerings, improve their products or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to maintain existing business and customers or attract new business and customers, as new opportunities develop, and as new competitors enter the industry. Competition in wireless communications is affected by various factors that include, among others: OEM concentrations; vertical integration; competition in certain geographic regions; government intervention or support of national industries or competitors; the ability to maintain product differentiation in light of evolving industry standards and speed of technological change (including the transition to smaller geometry process technologies, the demand for always on, always connected capabilities, the increasing use of AI and machine learning technologies and the need to run complex AI-based applications on devices); access to capacity in the supply chain; and value-added features that drive selling prices and consumer demand for new devices.We anticipate that additional competitors will introduce products as a result of growth opportunities in wireless communications, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, and technological and public policy changes. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape. For example, if any key supplier of technologies and intellectual property to the semiconductor industry was sold to one of our competitors, it could negatively affect our ability to procure or license such technologies and intellectual property in the future, at all or upon acceptable terms, which could have wide-ranging impacts on our business and operations.We expect that our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:•differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features (e.g., modem, RFFE including millimeter wave (mmWave), graphics and other processors, camera, connectivity and on-device AI) and with smaller geometry process technologies that drive both performance and lower power consumption;30•develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points and to effectively cover all geographic regions and all device tiers;•continue to be a leader in mobile, and drive the adoption of our technologies and integrated circuit products into the most popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices in mobile, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and other mobile computing devices;•increase or accelerate adoption of our technologies and products in industries and applications outside of mobile handsets, including automotive and IoT;•maintain or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit products at the premium device tier, while also driving the adoption of our products into high, mid- and low-tier devices across all regions;•remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and develop, commercialize and remain a leading supplier of 5G integrated circuit products, including RFFE products; •maintain access to sufficient capacity in the supply chain relative to our competitors to meet customer demand;•create standalone value and contribute to the success of our existing businesses through acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions, and by developing customer, licensee, vendor, distributor and other channel relationships in new industries and applications; •identify potential acquisition targets that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic needs, reach agreement on terms acceptable to us, close the transactions and effectively integrate these new businesses, products, technologies and employees; •provide leading products and technologies to OEMs, high level operating systems (HLOS) providers, operators, cloud providers and other industry participants as competitors, new industry entrants and other factors continue to affect the industry landscape;•be a preferred partner and sustain preferred relationships providing integrated circuit products that support multiple operating system and infrastructure platforms to industry participants that effectively commercialize new devices using these platforms; and•continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in computing and other consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging regions.We compete with many different semiconductor companies, ranging from multinational companies with integrated research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing organizations across a broad spectrum of product lines, to companies that are focused on a single application, industry or standard product, including those that produce products for mobile handsets, automotive or IoT, among others. Most of these competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our businesses or product lines. Companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Apple, Broadcom, HiSilicon, MediaTek, Mobileye, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC. Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to use our competitors’ integrated circuit products, to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, or to utilize alternative technologies; lower cost structures or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies, competitors or OEMs that sell devices that do not contain our integrated circuit products; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; the development and sale of infrastructure equipment for wireless networks, which may enable such competitors to better optimize their integrated circuit products for performance on those networks; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and OEMs in certain geographic regions (such as China); more experience in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT); and a more established presence in certain regions. In addition, certain of our largest customers have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize our competitors’ integrated circuit products in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. Further, certain of those customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products (effectively making them competitors), which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).” Further, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers or suppliers; limit, prevent or discourage certain of our customers or suppliers from transacting business with us; or make it more expensive to do so. This could advantage our competitors by enabling them with increased sales, economies of scale, operating income and/or cash flows, and/or enabling critical technology transfer, allowing them to increase their investments in technology development, research and development, and 31commercialization of products. See also the Risk Factor titled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.” Competition in any or all product areas or device tiers may result in the loss of business or customers, which would negatively impact our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Such competition may also reduce average selling prices for our chipset products or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging regions and China where competitors may have lower cost structures or may have a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins on their products. Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees’ products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIESFailures in our products, or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.Our products are complex and may contain defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system. Development of products in new domains of technology, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or other unintended functionality could also be introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious actors, either directly or through third-party products or software used in our products or IT infrastructure. Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use. Risks associated with product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into consumer and other devices.The use of devices containing our products to interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers’ products, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or our customers’ products or IT infrastructure. Such attacks could result in the disruption of our customers’ businesses or the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology or intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of our customers, their employees or the end users of our customers’ devices. While we continue to focus on this issue and take measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities continue to evolve, enabling more elaborate functionality and applications, and increasing the risk of security failures, and techniques used to perpetrate cybersecurity attacks are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.”Our products may be responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products and networks. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, meet certain regulatory or industry standards (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry), or other product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell to our customers, the devices into which our products are integrated and the end users of such devices, and potentially to our customers’ IT infrastructure. Such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities could give rise to significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, repairing or replacing defective products, writing down defective inventory or indemnification obligations under our agreements, and could result in the loss of sales and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, a loss of design wins, a shifting of business to our competitors, and litigation or regulatory action against us, and could harm our reputation, our relationships with customers and partners and our ability to attract new customers, as well as the perceptions of our brand. Other potential adverse impacts of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities include shipment delays, write-offs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and losses on unfavorable purchase commitments. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in the products of our customers or licensees could cause a delay or decrease in demand for the products into which our products are integrated, and thus for our products.In addition, the occurrence of defects, errors or security vulnerabilities may give rise to product liability claims, particularly if such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products or the technology we use, or the products into which they are integrated, result in personal injury or death, and could result in significant costs, expenses and losses. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant, and could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel and harm our business, even if we are successful. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question, and even though we may have indemnity from our customers, and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses. We may also be required to indemnify and/or defend our customers from product liability claims relating to our products. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate, may not cover the claims, and future coverage may be unavailable on 32acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results. The above is exacerbated by the fact that our products may be used, and perform critical functions, in various high-risk applications such as: automobiles, including ADAS/AD functions; cameras and artificial intelligence, including home and enterprise security; home automation, including smoke and noxious gas detectors; medical condition monitoring; location and asset tracking and management, including wearables for child safety and elderly health; robotics, including public safety drones and autonomous municipality vehicles; and XR for treatment of phobias or PTSD, early detection of disorders or special needs, among others.Accordingly, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and the end users of our customers’ products. If any of these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTYThe enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property and by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions.We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, international treaties and other methods, to protect our intellectual property, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and intellectual property is difficult and time consuming. The steps we have taken have not always prevented, and we cannot be certain the steps we take in the future will prevent, the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our products, technologies or intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully or as readily as U.S. laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.”Some industry participants who have a vested interest in devaluing patents in general, or standard-essential patents in particular, have mounted attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established patent laws. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any potential changes. In the United States, Europe (including the United Kingdom), India, China and elsewhere, there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law changes, and there is current and potential future litigation regarding patents, the outcomes of which could be detrimental to our licensing business. Some proposed changes would apply to only standard-essential patents, and such changes may substantially alter the incentives to participate in standardization or develop standards-compliant products. See also the Risk Factor entitled “Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.”Further, the laws in certain foreign countries in which our patents are or may be licensed, or our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including certain countries in Asia, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States. In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of any standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in the future in ways that are detrimental to our licensing programs or to the sale or use of our products or technologies.We have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property and contracts, including collecting royalties for use of our patent portfolio due to, among others: refusal by certain licensees to report and pay all or a portion of the royalties they owe to us; policies or political actions of governments, including trade protection and national security policies; challenges to our licensing practices under competition laws; adoption of mandatory licensing provisions by foreign jurisdictions; failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce judgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and challenges before competition agencies to our licensing business or the pricing and integration of additional features and functionality into our chipset products. See also the Risk Factors titled “Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business” and “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.”We have engaged in litigation and arbitration in the past and may need to further litigate or arbitrate in the future to enforce our contract and intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation or arbitration, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable (which may in turn result in other licensees either not complying with their existing license agreements or initiating litigation or arbitration), license terms (including but not limited to royalty rates for the use of our intellectual property) could be imposed that are less favorable to us than existing terms, and we could incur substantial costs. Any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively 33impact our results of operations and cash flows. Further, even a positive resolution to our enforcement efforts may take time to conclude, which may reduce our revenues and cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development, in the periods prior to conclusion. Additionally, although our license agreements generally provide us with the right to audit the books and records of licensees, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. Further, certain licensees may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their books and records. To the extent we do not aggressively enforce our rights under our license agreements, licensees may not comply with their existing license agreements, and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed companies to enter into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, other unlicensed companies may not enter into license agreements.See also the Risk Factors titled “Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business” and “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.”Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business.From time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright or other intellectual property claims against us relating to our technologies or products, including those we have acquired from other companies. These claims have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation, and we are currently involved in such litigation, including certain matters described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We may not prevail in such litigation given, among other factors, the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products were found to infringe another company’s intellectual property, we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our products, or to license such intellectual property or pay damages or other compensation to such other company (any of which could be costly). If we are unable to redesign our products, license such intellectual property used in our products or otherwise distribute our products (e.g., through a licensed supplier), we could be prohibited from making and selling our products. Similarly, our suppliers could be found to infringe another company’s intellectual property, and such suppliers could then be enjoined from providing products or services to us.In any potential dispute involving us and another company’s patents or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products sold by us, or by intellectual property provided by us to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees’ sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and/or cause product release or shipment delays, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.We may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (or on the sale of our customers’ devices using such products) or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees’ sales, causing corresponding declines in our chipset or licensing revenues.Our use of open source software may harm our business.Certain of our software and our suppliers’ software may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, and we have seen, and believe that we will continue to see, customers request that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of our products’ source code and may expose our related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such open source software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of that software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers, or to license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is 34different than what we customarily use to license our software. Furthermore, in the course of product development, we may make contributions to third-party open source projects that could subject our intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. For example, to encourage the growth of a software ecosystem that is interoperable with our products, we may need to contribute certain implementations under the open source licensing terms that govern such projects, which may adversely impact our associated intellectual property. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property upon which our licensing programs depend, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Also, our use and our customers’ use of open source software may subject our products and our customers’ products to governmental and third-party scrutiny and delays in product certification, which could cause customers to view our products as less desirable than our competitors’ products. GENERAL RISK FACTORSWe operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns. We are also susceptible to declines in global, regional and local economic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to these dynamics, among others.The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, volatile, subject to downturns and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. Periods of downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, excess or obsolete inventory adjustments or reserves, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and erosion of average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to such cyclical downturns. During such downturns, our revenues may decline, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted. We are currently seeing and expect to continue to see weakness in the macroeconomic environment (negatively impacting consumer demand for smartphones and other devices that incorporate our products and technologies) and elevated inventory levels at certain of our customers (negatively impacting the volume of chipsets they purchase from us until such inventory is depleted). Until these conditions improve, we expect that both of these dynamics will have a negative impact on our revenues, results of operations and cash flows.A decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, such as we are currently seeing, or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or licensees, could also have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including: a decrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our customers and/or the inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties; and/or negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers’ and licensees’ ability to purchase or pay for our products and intellectual property and network operators’ ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be adversely affected, potentially leading to a reduction, cancellation or delay of orders for our products. Further, inflationary pressure may increase our costs, including employee compensation costs, reduce demand for our products or those of our customers or licensees due to increased prices of those products, or result in employee attrition to the extent our compensation does not keep up with inflation, particularly if our competitors’ compensation does.Our stock price and financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock and our financial results include those identified above and throughout this Risk Factors section, as well as: volatility of the stock market in general and technology and semiconductor companies in particular; announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers or licensees, including any announcement concerning the initiation of, or any developments in, any lawsuit or governmental investigation or proceeding against us; and variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors, among others. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities, among other reasons. We are and may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s attention and our resources. Certain legal matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”Geopolitical conflicts, natural disasters, pandemics and other health crises, and other factors outside of our control, could significantly disrupt our business.We have operations and facilities in the United States and many other countries throughout the world. We derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in devices they sell into China (which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world); our key suppliers and their manufacturing foundries and assembly, test and other facilities are primarily located in Taiwan and Korea; our manufacturing facilities for RFFE and RF products are located in China, Germany and Singapore; the primary warehouses where we store finished goods for fulfillment of customer orders are located in Singapore; and a significant portion of our workforce (including engineering and other technical personnel) is based in India. Acts of war, terrorism, geopolitical conflicts, political instability or tensions such as the current geopolitical tensions involving China and Taiwan, natural disasters, the effects of climate change, pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, or other health crises affecting any of 35the regions in which we operate, and particularly those in which our customers, suppliers, manufacturing facilities and/or significant portions of our workforce are concentrated, could significantly disrupt our business by, among others: reducing demand for our products and services or end-user devices incorporating our products or intellectual property; impairing our customers’ or licensees’ ability to purchase or pay for our products, services or intellectual property; delaying or preventing our suppliers from providing us with critical components or raw materials; delaying or preventing our foundry or semiconductor assembly and test providers from manufacturing, assembling or testing our products; preventing us from manufacturing products or shipping finished products; damaging or destroying inventory; delaying or preventing network operators from upgrading their wireless networks to meet new technology standards; or preventing a significant number of our employees, or employees who perform critical functions, from performing their duties for us. For example, our business depends on our ability to receive consistent and reliable chipset supply from our foundry partners, particularly in Taiwan. Consequently, a significant or prolonged military or other geopolitical conflict involving China and Taiwan could severely limit or prevent us from receiving chipset supply from Taiwan, which would have a material adverse impact on our business (and likely on the semiconductor industry as a whole). In addition, acts of war, terrorism, geopolitical conflicts, political instability or tensions, natural disasters, the effects of climate change, pandemics or other health crises impacting any of these regions could also result in a decline in global, regional or local economic conditions generally, or increased volatility in financial markets, which could have adverse effects on our business and financial results. See also the Risk Factor titled “We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns. We are also susceptible to declines in global, regional and local economic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to these dynamics, among others.” Any such events may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section.Our business may suffer due to the impact of, or our failure to comply with, the various existing, new or amended laws, regulations, policies or standards to which we are subject.Our business and products, and those of our customers and licensees, are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally, as well as government policies and the specifications of international, national and regional communications standards bodies (collectively, Regulations). These include, among others, Regulations related to: patent licensing practices; antitrust, competition and competitive business practices; the flow of funds out of certain countries (e.g., China); cybersecurity; privacy and data protection; imports and exports, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce; protection of intellectual property; trade and trade protection including tariffs; foreign policy and national security; environmental protection (including climate change), health and safety; supply chain, responsible sourcing, including the use of conflict minerals, and human rights; spectrum availability and license issuance; adoption of standards; taxation; labor, employment and human capital; corporate governance; public disclosure and reporting (including reporting of ESG-related data); automotive industry safety and quality standards; AI technologies; and business conduct. Compliance with, or changes in the interpretation of, existing Regulations, the adoption of new Regulations, changes in the oversight of our activities by governments or standards bodies, or rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such Regulations, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See also the Risk Factors titled “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings,” “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations,” “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions,” “There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises, geopolitical conflicts and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues,” and “Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.”Regulations are complex and changing (which may create uncertainty regarding compliance), are subject to varying interpretations, and their application in practice may evolve over time. As a result, our efforts to comply with Regulations may fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. Failure to comply with any Regulation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. New Regulations, or evolving interpretations thereof, may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies or procedures; may divert management time and attention to compliance activities; and may negatively impact our ability to conduct business in certain jurisdictions.There are risks associated with our debt.Our outstanding debt and any additional debt we incur may have negative consequences on our business, including, among others: requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, industries or the market. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our debt depends upon our future performance, which is subject to economic and political conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may be required to, among others: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend payments and/or our stock repurchase program; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In 36addition, any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such refinancing or restructuring would increase. Further, if there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt financing in the future and the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly are subject to examination of our tax returns and reports by taxing authorities in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, most notably in countries where we earn a routine return and the tax authorities believe substantial value-add activities are performed, as well as countries where we own intellectual property. The final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. In such case, our income tax provision, results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made could be negatively affected.Tax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business. Most of our income is taxable in the United States with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as FDII (foreign-derived intangible income). Beginning in fiscal 2027, the effective tax rate for FDII increases from 13% to 16%. Further, if U.S. tax rates increase and/or the FDII deduction is eliminated or reduced, both of which have been proposed by the current U.S. presidential administration, our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely (potentially materially) affected. Also, if our customers move manufacturing operations to the United States, our FDII deduction may be reduced. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to transfer pricing and continues to develop new proposals including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establishing a minimum tax on global income. These changes, if and as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows.Item 1B.

804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2004,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Recent Highlights Revenues for fiscal 2004 were $4.9 billion, with net income of $1.7 billion. The following recent developments during fiscal 2004 were key for our business: • Strong CDMA market growth throughout the world drove demand for our products and the products of our licensees. Enhanced multimedia functionality, increased growth of 1xEV-DO, local number portability initiatives and improving competitive positioning of CDMA operators drove worldwide growth in CDMA phone sales. Introduction of new CDMA networks in developing regions, as well as continued growth of networks in China and India, also contributed to growth in CDMA sales. Worldwide, 1xEV-DO grew to over nine million subscribers in September 2004. During fiscal 2004, we shipped approximately 137 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) integrated circuits for mobile CDMA phones and data modules, nearly all of which were third generation (3G), including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO and WCDMA. • By calendar year end 2004, operators are expected to have launched 70 WCDMA networks as reported by GSMA (GSM Association). WCDMA subscriber growth in Japan and Europe, and new network launches in Europe and Asia drove growth in WCDMA phone sales during fiscal 2004. Thirteen subscriber licensees and eleven infrastructure licensees reported sales of WCDMA products in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. WCDMA royalties grew from 12% of royalties reported in the first fiscal quarter of 2004 for licensee sales during the fourth fiscal quarter of 2003 to 26% of royalties reported in the fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2004 for licensee sales during the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2004. Currently, average WCDMA phone prices are significantly higher than worldwide average CDMA2000 phone prices. During fiscal 2004, several leading manufacturers announced the selection of our WCDMA MSM integrated circuits for their WCDMA phone products, including Siemens, Samsung, LG Electronics, Sanyo and Option. • As a result of record demand for CDMA products, our integrated circuits business continued to experience supply constraints which resulted in our inability to meet certain customer demands. To enable better supply of integrated circuit products, we have increased and extended firm orders to our foundry suppliers and are working with them to increase capacity. We are also evaluating potential new suppliers to augment our future needs. • In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we determined that, due to the global growth of WCDMA networks and the increasing variability of our licensees’ market shares due to greater global competition, we would begin to recognize royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter, rather than continuing to estimate royalty revenues earned from certain licensees in advance of receiving their royalty reports. Accordingly, we did not estimate royalty revenues earned in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, and royalties recorded as revenue for fiscal 2004 do not reflect an entire year’s worth of royalties (some royalties reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were recorded based on estimates as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003). Our Business and Operating Segments We design, manufacture and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our CDMA technology and other technologies. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, from license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property, from services and related hardware sales and from software development and related services. Operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services, research and development, selling, general and administrative, amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, asset impairment charges and other expenses. 40 Table of Contents We conduct business through four operating segments. These segments are: QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, or QCT; QUALCOMM Technology Licensing, or QTL; QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet, or QWI; and QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives, or QSI. QCT is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning. QCT’s integrated circuit products and software are used in wireless phones and infrastructure equipment. The wireless phone integrated circuits include the Mobile Station Modem (MSM), Radio Frequency (RF) and Power Management (PM) devices. The wireless phone integrated circuits and software perform voice and data communication, multimedia and global positioning functions, radio conversion between radio and baseband signals and power management. The infrastructure equipment integrated circuits provide the core baseband CDMA modem functionality in the operator’s equipment. QCT software products are the operating systems that control the phone and the functionality imbedded in our integrated circuit products. QCT revenues comprised 63% of total consolidated revenues in both fiscal 2004 and 2003 and 54% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2002. QTL grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of CDMA (including, without limitation, cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA) products. QTL receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating our intellectual property. QTL revenues comprised 27%, 26% and 29% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. QWI, which includes QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions (QWBS), QUALCOMM Internet Services (QIS) and QUALCOMM Government Technologies (QGOV), generates revenue primarily through mobile communication products and services, software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications. QWBS provides satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging and position reporting services to transportation companies, private fleets, construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies. QIS provides the BREW product and services for the development and over-the-air deployment of data services on wireless devices. QIS also provides QChat and QPoint products and services. QChat enables virtually instantaneous push-to-chat functionality on CDMA-based wireless devices while QPoint enables operators to offer E-911 and location-based applications and services. The QGOV division provides development, hardware and analytical expertise to United States government agencies involving wireless communications technologies. The QGOV division included the former Digital Cinema business prior to June 2004. In June 2004, we were notified that a competing digital cinema compression technology was selected by the motion picture studio consortium tasked with technology selection for digital cinema applications. As such, we are no longer pursuing the Digital Cinema business. Revenues from the Digital Cinema business were $1 million, $9 million and $14 million in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. QWI revenues comprised 12%, 13% and 16% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. QSI makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services for wireless voice and Internet data communications. Our strategy is to invest in CDMA operators, licensed device manufacturers and start-up companies that we believe open new markets for CDMA technology, support the design and introduction of new CDMA-based products or possess unique capabilities or technology to promote Internet data communications. Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2005, we expect to present the operating results of our wireless multimedia U.S. operator in the QSI segment. Looking Forward In fiscal year 2005, we expect continued growth in the overall CDMA2000 and WCDMA market, with particularly strong growth in WCDMA and emerging CDMA2000 markets. We expect continued growth in 1xEV-DO in South Korea, Japan and Latin America, as well as North America, with expected launches of nationwide service by both Verizon Wireless and Sprint PCS. The global expansion of broadband data services is expected to continue to drive demand for both 1xEV-DO phones and data cards for laptop services. Operator competition in Japan, North America and other regions is also accelerating data strategies and services as one operator responds to the plans of another. As reported by mobilemonday.net, a community of and for mobile professionals, operators are expected to have launched 70 WCDMA networks by the end of calendar 2004, which is expected to drive meaningful growth in WCDMA phone sales during fiscal year 2005. Cingular Wireless in North America is looking to launch WCDMA/HSDPA later in 2005. We anticipate 3G wireless licenses will be granted in China in calendar 2005. When the licenses are granted, we expect operators in China will be authorized to upgrade and deploy third 41 Table of Contents generation CDMA-based networks. We also expect additional CDMA450 network launches in fiscal 2005 to contribute to growth. We believe our QCT business will increasingly benefit from strong growth in the WCDMA market as we leverage our high quality products and customer relationships to further a strong and growing list of WCDMA phone manufacturer customers. Growing demand for phones and devices with greater multimedia functionality will continue to drive demand for increasing functionality in our MSM chips. We will continue to invest heavily to position our QCT business for success in the WCDMA market, as well as to continue to maintain our strong position in the CDMA2000 market. In particular, we intend to continue to invest significant resources in developing integrated circuit products to support high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork operation including CDMA2000 1X and 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, FLO, OFDM and multimedia applications which encompass development of graphical display, camera and video capabilities, as well as higher computational capability and lower power on - chip computers and signal processors. We continue to work on different initiatives for low-cost phones in addition to reducing costs through further integration of multimedia capabilities of mid- to high-end phones. We will also continue our significant development efforts with respect to our BREW applications development platform and our new MediaFLO content distribution system and FLO technology for delivery of low cost multimedia content to multiple subscribers. We are working closely with many operators and manufacturers to support rapid and reliable WCDMA deployment and availability of WCDMA phones (with increasing multimedia features and capabilities). We expect that in 2005 average WCDMA phone prices will decrease significantly, although we expect them to still be higher than average CDMA2000 phone prices. BREW is expected to play an increasingly important role in generating consumer demand for wireless phones. BREW offers operators new capabilities for their products and an open platform for delivery of data services that can grow operator’s data revenues. We expect more operators to launch BREW services and greater volumes of BREW software downloads to drive increasing revenues for our BREW business. Although we have taken action to mitigate shortages of integrated circuits that we supply, the effects of such shortages have caused some customer frustration and could negatively affect our future business. We expect that the costs of certain integrated circuit products could increase as a result of our efforts to increase the availability of products in short supply. While we work closely with customers to expedite their processes for evaluating products from our new foundry suppliers, in some instances, transition to new product supply may cause a temporary decline in shipments of specific products to individual customers. As a result of our efforts to increase capacity at our current suppliers combined with the potential to bring on additional suppliers, we expect our shortages of integrated circuits to be alleviated in the future. We are dependent upon the adoption and commercial deployment of 3G wireless communications equipment, products and services based on our CDMA technology to increase our revenues and market share. We continue to face significant competition from non-CDMA technologies, as well as competition from companies offering other CDMA based products. You should also refer to the Risk Factors included in this Annual Report for further discussion of these and other risks related to our business. Revenue Concentrations Revenues from customers in South Korea, the United States and Japan comprised 43%, 21% and 18%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2004 as compared to 45%, 23% and 15%, respectively, in fiscal 2003, and 39%, 31% and 18%, respectively, in fiscal 2002. We distinguish revenue from external customers by geographic areas based on customer location. The increase in revenues from customers in Japan, as a percentage of the total, is primarily attributed to higher royalties from licensees in Japan resulting from the growth of CDMA2000 and WCDMA in Japan as well as their success in exporting products worldwide. The decrease in revenues from customers in the United States, as a percentage of the total, is primarily attributed to overall increases in revenues in geographic regions other than the United States. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent 42 Table of Contents assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets and investments, income taxes, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others. Revenue Recognition. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, from royalties for our intellectual property, from messaging and other services and related hardware sales, from software development and related services, and from license fees for intellectual property. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates. We license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of CDMA (including, without limitation, cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1x EV-DO/1xEV-DV, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA) products. We recognized royalty revenue as earned when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made for certain licensees through the third quarter of fiscal 2004. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we recognize revenues solely when royalties are reported to us by our licensees as we no longer have the ability to reliably estimate these amounts. The change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 due to the fact that no estimated royalty revenues were recorded in that quarter. As a result of this change, we believe that the estimates and assumptions used in applying our revenue recognition policies with respect to the timing and amount of recording our royalty revenues will have a less material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. Our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. As of September 30, 2004, our goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $356 million and $128 million, respectively. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. We assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We hold minority strategic investments in publicly-traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile. These investments totaled $150 million at September 30, 2004. We record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future. When assessing a publicly-traded investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost, the performance of the investee’s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations. We also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties. In the event our judgments change as to 43 Table of Contents other-than-temporary declines in value, we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values are difficult to determine. These investments totaled $163 million at September 30, 2004. We record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future. When assessing investments in private companies for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the share price from the investee’s latest financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan, the investee’s revenue and cost trends, the liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee’s products and services. From time to time, we may consider third party evaluations, valuation reports or advice from investment banks. We also consider new products/services that the investee may have forthcoming, any significant news that has been released specific to the investee or the investee’s competitors and/or industry and the outlook of the overall industry in which the investee operates. In the event our judgments change as to other-than temporary declines in value, we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Income Taxes. Our income tax provision is based on calculations and assumptions that will be subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Should the actual results differ from our estimates, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. Such adjustment could have a material impact on our results of operations. The Company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and establishes a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. As of September 30, 2004, gross deferred tax assets were $1.1 billion. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, the Company could be required to increase its valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in its effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results. As of September 30, 2004, the Company has recorded gross deferred tax assets of $418 million related to capital loss carry forwards. We can only use capital losses to offset capital gains. Based upon our assessments of projected future capital gains and losses and related tax planning strategies, we expect that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all the capital losses that we have incurred through fiscal 2004. Therefore, we have provided a valuation allowance in the amount of $139 million for the portion of capital losses we do not expect to utilize. Adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses and capital gains are reflected in the period the change is made. We consider the operating earnings of non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States. No provision has been made for United States federal and state, or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of which is approximately $1.5 billion as of September 30, 2004. Should we repatriate foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is made. We are currently studying the impact of the one-time favorable foreign dividend provisions recently enacted as part of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, and may decide to repatriate future earnings of some of our foreign subsidiaries. Litigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s operating results, liquidity or financial position, the Company believes the claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend the actions. We estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated 44 Table of Contents liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. The Company has not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with the Company’s legal proceedings based on the Company’s belief that a liability, while possible, is not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations. Licensing We grant licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, use and sale of CDMA (including, without limitation, cdmaOne, CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA) products. Licensees typically pay a nonrefundable license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee, typically five to seven years. We earn royalties on such licensed CDMA products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees’ sales occur. Our licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter, and, in some instances, although royalties are reported quarterly, payment is on a semi-annual basis. During periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the quarter in which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made. Not all royalties earned were estimated. Royalties for licensees for which we had minimal reporting history and certain licensees that did not incorporate our integrated circuit products into their own products were recorded one quarter in arrears, i.e. in the quarter in which the royalties were reported to us by those licensees. Estimates of royalty revenues for the Estimated Licensees were based on analyses of our sales of integrated circuits to Estimated Licensees, historical royalty data for Estimated Licensees, an estimate of the time between our sales of integrated circuits to Estimated Licensees and Estimated Licensees’ sales of CDMA products, average sales price forecasts, estimates of inventory levels and current market and economic trends. Once royalty reports were received from the Estimated Licensees, the variance between such reports and the estimate was recorded as royalty revenue in the quarter in which the reports were received, i.e. in most cases, the quarter subsequent to the quarter in which the estimated royalties were recorded as revenue. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we determined that, due to recent escalating business trends, we no longer have the ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from certain licensees. These escalating trends include the commercial launches and global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market share among licensees due to increased global competition and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees. Accordingly, we did not estimate royalty revenues earned in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we began recognizing revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalties reported by our licensees were $151 million higher than royalty revenues from external licensees recorded in fiscal 2004 because $151 million in royalties that were reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 had been estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. To facilitate an understanding of the impact of the change, the following table compares royalty revenues recorded as revenue in fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002 to royalties reported by our licensees during those same periods (in millions): 45 Table of Contents 2004 2003 2002 Royalty revenues from external licensees, as recorded in our consolidated statements of operations $ 1,141 $ 838 $ 725 Estimate recorded for the fourth quarter of the prior year for Estimated Licensees* 151 150 122 Estimate recorded at end of the current year for Estimated Licensees — (151 ) (150 ) Total royalties reported by external licensees during the current year $ 1,292 $ 837 $ 697 * Recorded as revenue in the prior year, but reported by licensees during the current year. The table above illustrates that the difference between royalties reported by external licensees and royalty revenues from external licensees recorded in our consolidated statements of operations has equaled the difference between the estimate for Estimated Licensees at the end of the current year and the estimate for Estimated Licensees at the end of the prior year. Strategic Investments in our QSI Segment Our QSI segment makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services for wireless voice and Internet data communications. QSI segment assets totaled $400 million at September 30, 2004, compared to $839 million at September 30, 2003. In general, we enter into strategic relationships with CDMA wireless operators and developers of innovative technologies or products for the wireless communications industry. Due to financial and competitive challenges facing CDMA wireless operators, we cannot assure you that our investments in or loans to these operators will generate financial returns or that they will result in increased adoption or continued use of CDMA technologies. CDMA wireless operators to whom we have provided funding have limited operating histories, are faced with significant capital requirements and are highly leveraged and/or have limited financial resources. If these CDMA wireless operators are not successful, we may have to write down our investments in or loans to these operators. Our QSI segment maintains strategic holdings of various issuers and types. These securities include available-for-sale equity securities and derivative instruments that are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. We strategically invest in companies in the high-technology industry and typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to market risks in these investments. Available-for-sale equity securities and derivative instruments recorded at fair value subject us to equity price risk. The fair values of these strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market price volatility. Our strategic investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time, and changes in concentrations may affect price volatility. In general, our investments in available-for-sale equity securities and derivative instruments suffered significant decreases in market value during the last three years. Downward fluctuations and market trends could further adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the realizable value of these securities and derivative instruments is subject to market and other conditions. QSI also makes strategic investments in privately held companies, including early stage companies and venture funds. These investments are recorded at cost or under the equity method, but the recorded values may be written down due to changes in the companies’ conditions or prospects. These strategic investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products the investees are developing may never materialize. As a result, we could lose all or a portion of our investments in these companies, which could negatively affect our financial position and operating results. Most of these strategic investments will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment, if at all. To the extent such investments become liquid and meet strategic and price objectives, we may sell the investments and recognize the realized gain (loss) in investment income (expense). We regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our investments in both marketable and private securities. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary, we will record a charge to investment income (expense). During fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, the QSI segment recognized $12 million, $127 million and $221 million, respectively, in charges related to other-than- temporary losses on marketable and private securities. In some cases, we make strategic investments that require us 46 Table of Contents to consolidate or record our equity in the losses of early stage companies. The consolidation of these losses can adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to the investments. From time to time, we may accept an equity interest in a licensee as consideration for a portion or all of the license fee payable under our CDMA license agreement. QTL records license fee revenue based on the fair value of the equity instruments received, if determinable. The measurement date for determination of fair value is the earlier of the date at which a performance commitment is made or the date at which the performance is complete. The evaluation procedures used to determine fair value include, but are not limited to, examining the current market price for the shares if the licensee is publicly traded, examining recent rounds of financing and the licensee’s business plan if not publicly traded, and performing other due diligence procedures. This equity program does not affect the licensees’ obligations to pay royalties under their CDMA license agreements. The amount of cash consideration and the timing of revenue recognition vary depending on the terms of each agreement. As of September 30, 2004, ten licensees have participated in this program. We recognized $5 million of revenue in each of fiscal 2004 and 2003 and $6 million of revenue in fiscal 2002 related to equity received as license fees. The equity investments received from this program are assets of QSI. Key developments in our strategic investments during fiscal 2004 included the sale of the Vésper Operating Companies and related assets which are presented as discontinued operations, our receipt from Pegaso of prepayment of our $193 million loan facility, and ongoing investment in Inquam. Discontinued Operations in our QSI Segment. In fiscal 1999, we acquired ownership interests in two companies in Brazil, Vésper São Paulo S.A. and Vésper S.A. (the Vésper Operating Companies). In November 2001, we consummated a series of transactions resulting in an overall financial restructuring of the Vésper Operating Companies, which resulted in our holding direct and indirect controlling ownership interests in the Vésper Operating Companies. On December 2, 2003 (the Closing Date), Embratel Participações S.A. (Embratel) acquired our direct and indirect ownership interests in the Vésper Operating Companies (the Embratel sale transaction) for no consideration. The Vésper Operating Companies’ existing communication towers and related interests in tower site property leases (Vésper Towers) were not included in the Embratel sale transaction, and as such, we effectively retained, through a new wholly-owned subsidiary (TowerCo), ownership and control of the Vésper Towers. The Vésper Towers had a net book value of approximately $5 million at December 28, 2003. Concurrent with the closing, the Vésper Operating Companies entered into a 10-year agreement (renewable at the Vésper Operating Companies’ option for up to two successive 5-year terms) whereby the Vésper Operating Companies would pay a monthly fee to us for use of aerial and ground space on the tower sites. We provided approximately $6 million to fund operations of the Vésper Operating Companies during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 prior to their sale and additionally provided approximately $39 million in aggregate funding to or for the benefit of the Vésper Operating Companies on or before the Closing Date to facilitate the Embratel sale transaction. Such funding enabled the Vésper Operating Companies to completely extinguish their existing local bank debt (at an agreed discount) to allow us to retain ownership of the Vésper Towers free and clear of any local bank security interest. The major classes of assets and liabilities sold in the Embratel sale transaction included: $25 million in accounts receivable, $5 million in inventory, $24 million in other current assets, $95 million in property, plant and equipment, $6 million in other assets, $52 million in accounts payable, $5 million in payroll and other benefits related liabilities, $6 million in unearned revenue, $1 million in other current liabilities, $14 million in long-term debt and $3 million in other liabilities. We realized a net loss of $52 million on the Embratel sale transaction during the first quarter of fiscal 2004, including a $74 million loss on the net assets sold to Embratel and a $46 million loss related to the recognition of cumulative foreign currency translation losses previously included in stockholders’ equity, partially offset by $68 million in gains related to the extinguishment of local bank debt and the settlement of other liabilities. On November 19, 2002, we won bids to acquire personal mobile service (SMP) licenses in certain regions of Brazil. Approximately $8 million of the approximate $82 million purchase price for the SMP licenses was paid in December 2002. The remaining Brazilian real-denominated obligation was financed by the Brazilian government at an interest rate of 12% per annum, plus an adjustment for inflation. These SMP licenses were not included in the Embratel sale transaction. In December 2003, we initiated a waiver and return of the SMP licenses to Anatel, the telecommunications regulatory agency in Brazil. In February 2004, the waiver and return of the SMP licenses was approved by Anatel, and the license debt was extinguished. We realized a net gain of $19 million as a result of the removal of the $104 million SMP licenses and the related $123 million debt and accrued interest during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. 47 Table of Contents On March 2, 2004, we sold TowerCo to Embratel in a separately negotiated transaction (the TowerCo sale transaction) for $45 million in cash. TowerCo’s assets were primarily comprised of $5 million in property, plant and equipment. We realized a net gain of $40 million on the TowerCo sale transaction during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. As a result of the disposition of the remaining operations and assets related to the Vésper Operating Companies, we determined that the results of operations and cash flows related to the Vésper Operating Companies, including the results related to TowerCo and the SMP licenses and the gains and losses realized on the Embratel and TowerCo sales transactions, should be presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows. Our statements of operations and cash flows for all prior periods have been adjusted to present the discontinued operations. For fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, revenues of $36 million, $123 million and $125 million, respectively, were reported in the loss from discontinued operations. At September 30, 2004, we had no remaining assets or liabilities related to the Vésper Operating Companies, TowerCo or the SMP licenses recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Prepayment of the Pegaso Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V. Loan Facility. We had various financing arrangements, including a bridge loan facility, an equipment loan facility, interim and additional interim loan facilities, with Pegaso Comunicaciones y Sistemas S.A. de C.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Pegaso Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V., a CDMA wireless operator in Mexico (collectively referred to as Pegaso). On September 10, 2002, Telefónica Móviles (Telefónica) acquired a 65% controlling interest in Pegaso. On October 10, 2002, Pegaso paid $82 million in full satisfaction of the interim and additional interim loans. On November 8, 2002, Pegaso paid $435 million in full satisfaction of the bridge loan facility. We used approximately $139 million of the bridge loan proceeds to purchase outstanding vendor debt owed by Pegaso to other lenders. On June 13, 2003, Pegaso prepaid $281 million of the equipment loan facility, including accrued interest, in accordance with certain terms of the equipment loan facility. On December 15, 2003, Pegaso prepaid $193 million, including accrued interest, in full satisfaction of the equipment loan facility. We recognized $12 million, $41 million and $9 million in interest income related to the Pegaso financing arrangements during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, including $10 million and $23 million of deferred interest income recorded as a result of the prepayments in fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. Investment in Inquam Limited. We have invested $200 million in the convertible preferred shares of Inquam Limited (Inquam) for an approximate 42% ownership interest in Inquam. Inquam owns, develops and manages wireless communications systems, either directly or indirectly, with the intent of deploying CDMA-based technology, primarily in Europe. Starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we and another investor (the Other Investor) also extended $117 million in bridge loan financings to Inquam, including $31 million in bridge loan funding put in place during fiscal 2004. We funded our approximate $58 million share of these bridge loans and had no remaining funding commitment at September 30, 2004. Inquam is a variable interest entity. We do not consolidate Inquam because we are not the primary beneficiary. We use the equity method to account for our investment in Inquam. We recorded $59 million, $99 million and $45 million in equity in losses of Inquam during fiscal 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. At September 30, 2004, our equity and debt investments in Inquam totaled $42 million, net of equity in losses. On September 22, 2003, we agreed, along with the Other Investor, to guarantee the payment of amounts due by Inquam under a bank credit agreement. During fiscal 2004, we and the Other Investor agreed to extend the guarantee and increase the maximum amount subject to the guarantee to $55 million. Our maximum liability under the guarantee is limited to an amount equal to 50% of the amounts outstanding under Inquam’s credit agreement, up to a maximum of approximately $28 million. Amounts outstanding under the bank credit agreement totaled $53 million as of September 30, 2004. The guarantee expires on November 30, 2004 when the bank credit facility matures. Inquam is currently working with the bank and other potential lenders to secure long-term “take out” financing to repay the existing loan on the maturity date. It is possible that we and the Other Investor may provide additional guarantees in connection with such take out financing. During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we and the Other Investor committed to fund an additional $2 million each. While we have no other obligations to provide funding to Inquam, we continue to have active discussions with Inquam and the Other Investor concerning the necessary funding for all or a part of Inquam’s business plan, potential restructuring and investment by other parties. While we may provide some additional funding and/or credit support in furtherance of Inquam’s business plan, the amount and form of such support is unknown, and none will be provided without commensurate support or consideration being provided by the Other Investor. If Inquam or its 48 Table of Contents operating companies cannot raise the funding needed for its business plan, Inquam’s growth potential and the value of our investment in Inquam may be negatively affected. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2004 were $4,880 million, compared to $3,847 million for fiscal 2003. Revenues from Samsung, LG Electronics and Motorola, customers of our QCT and QTL segments, comprised an aggregate of 15%, 15% and 10% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2004, compared to 17%, 13% and 13% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2003. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2004 were $3,514 million, compared to $2,862 million for fiscal 2003. Revenues from sales of integrated circuits increased $652 million, resulting primarily from an increase of $994 million related to higher unit shipments of MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, partially offset by a decrease of $331 million related to the effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2004 were $1,366 million, compared to $985 million for fiscal 2003. The increase resulted primarily from higher QTL segment royalties, resulting primarily from an increase in phone and infrastructure equipment sales by our licensees at higher average selling prices, partially offset by the effect of the change in timing of recognizing royalties to an “as reported” method during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalty revenues recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151 million of royalties that were reported by licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to us by licensees in fiscal 2004 were $1,292 million as compared to $837 million in fiscal 2003. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2004 was $1,484 million, compared to $1,268 million for fiscal 2003. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 42% for fiscal 2004, compared to 44% for fiscal 2003. The margin percentage improvement in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the increase in QCT revenues as a percentage of total equipment and services revenues, resulting in increased QCT margin relative to the total. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues may fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold and services provided, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2004, research and development expenses were $720 million or 15% of revenues, compared to $523 million or 14% of revenues for fiscal 2003. The dollar and percentage increases in research and development expenses primarily resulted from a $187 million increase in costs related to integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products, including CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, MediaFLO and HSDPA. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2004, selling, general and administrative expenses were $568 million or 12% of revenues, compared to $471 million or 12% of revenues for fiscal 2003. The dollar increase was primarily due to a $61 million increase in employee-related expenses, a $21 million increase in professional fees, primarily patent administration and other legal costs, and outside services, and a $12 million increase related to a charitable grant to an educational institution for the primary purpose of furthering the study of engineering and math. Asset Impairment and Related Charges. There were no asset impairment charges in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2003, we recorded a $34 million impairment loss on our wireless licenses in Australia due to developments that affected potential strategic alternatives for using the spectrum. The impairment loss recognized was the difference between the assets’ carrying values and their estimated fair values. Other Operating Income. For fiscal 2004, other operating income was $26 million, compared to $30 million in fiscal 2003. Other operating income during fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from the transfers of portions of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) auction discount voucher’s value (ADV) to a wireless operator. Other operating income during fiscal 2003 resulted from $47 million of other income related to the transfer of portions of the FCC auction discount voucher’s value to two wireless operators, offset by a $16 million charge related to the write down of notes receivable from an early stage CDMA wireless operator and an early stage media company. 49 Table of Contents Net Investment Income (Expense). Net investment income was $184 million for fiscal 2004, compared to net investment expense of $8 million for fiscal 2003. The change was primarily comprised as follows (in millions): Years Ended September 30, 2004 2003* Change Interest income: QSI $ 14 $ 45 $ (31 ) Corporate and other segments 161 113 48 Interest expense (2 ) (2 ) — Net realized gains on investments: QSI 56 63 (7 ) Corporate 32 17 15 Other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities (12 ) (100 ) 88 Other-than-temporary losses on other investments — (28 ) 28 Gains (losses) on derivative instruments 7 (3 ) 10 Equity in losses of investees (72 ) (113 ) 41 $ 184 $ (8 ) $ 192 * As adjusted for discontinued operations. The increase in interest income on cash and marketable securities held by corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates earned on these balances, and $6 million in interest income recorded as a result of a refund from the United States Internal Revenue Service. The decrease in QSI interest income was primarily the result of the prepayment on the Pegaso debt facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities during fiscal 2003 primarily related to an $81 million impairment of our investment in a wireless operator in South Korea and a $16 million impairment of our investment in a provider of semiconductor packaging, test and distribution services. The other-than-temporary losses on other investments during fiscal 2003 related to the impairment of our investments in two development stage CDMA wireless operators. Equity in losses of investees decreased primarily due to a decrease in losses incurred by Inquam, of which our share was $59 million for fiscal 2004 as compared to $99 million for fiscal 2003. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $588 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $536 million for fiscal 2003. The annual effective tax rate for continuing operations was approximately 25% for fiscal 2004, compared to 34% for fiscal 2003. The annual effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2004 was lower than the 2003 effective tax rate for continuing operations primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate, an increase in tax benefits recorded arising from the forecast of our ability to use capital loss carryforwards and the reduction of QTL earnings, which are taxed at a rate that is lower than our effective tax rate, as a percentage of total earnings due to the change in the timing of recognizing QTL royalties. Foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate are higher in fiscal 2004 primarily due to the adjustment of an intercompany royalty agreement and an increase in foreign earnings. The annual effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2004 is 10% lower than the United States federal statutory rate due primarily to a benefit of approximately 14% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, research and development tax credits and the forecast of our increased ability to use capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by state taxes of 4%. As of September 30, 2004, we had a valuation allowance of $139 million on previously incurred capital losses due to uncertainty as to our ability to generate sufficient capital gains to utilize all capital losses. We will continue to assess the realizability of capital losses. The amount of the valuation allowance on capital losses may be adjusted in the future as our ability to utilize capital losses changes. A change in the valuation allowance may impact the provision for income taxes in the period the change occurs. We are currently considering actions that may result in our ability to utilize some of the capital loss currently reserved, which may result in a reduction of our valuation allowance and income tax expense in subsequent periods. 50 Table of Contents Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2003 were $3,847 million, compared to $2,915 million for fiscal 2002. Revenues from Samsung, LG Electronics, Motorola and Kyocera, customers of our QCT, QTL and other nonreportable segments, comprised an aggregate of 17%, 13%, 13% and 9% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2003, compared to 16%, 12%, 8% and 14% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2002. The percentages for Kyocera included 1% and 4% in fiscal 2003 and 2002, respectively, related to services provided to Kyocera by employees from our terrestrial-based CDMA wireless consumer phone business which was sold to Kyocera in February 2000. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2003 were $2,862 million, compared to $2,080 million for fiscal 2002. Revenues from sales of integrated circuits increased by $828 million, primarily due to an increase in unit shipments of MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2003 were $985 million, compared to $835 million for fiscal 2002. The increase resulted from higher QTL segment royalties, resulting from an increase in phone sales by our licensees. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2003 was $1,268 million, compared to $954 million for fiscal 2002. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 44% for fiscal 2003, compared to 46% for fiscal 2002. The margin percentage improvement in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily due to the increase in QCT revenues as a percentage of total equipment and services revenues, resulting in increased QCT margin relative to the total. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2003, research and development expenses were $523 million or 14% of revenues, compared to $452 million or 16% of revenues for fiscal 2002. The dollar increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to an $84 million increase in costs primarily related to increased engineering resources for integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products, including CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV, GSM/GPRS/EDGE, WLAN, WCDMA and radioOne technologies, partially offset by an $11 million reduction in research and development efforts supporting the QGOV division of the QWI segment and a $3 million reduction of support efforts related to the Globalstar business. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2003, selling, general and administrative expenses were $471 million or 12% of revenues, compared to $401 million or 14% of revenues for fiscal 2002. The dollar increase was primarily due to a $27 million increase in employee-related expenses, a $12 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, a $6 million increase in professional fees, primarily patent administration and outside services, and a $6 million increase related to international marketing and support efforts. Amortization of Goodwill and Other Acquisition Related Intangible Assets. For fiscal 2003, amortization of goodwill and other acquisition related intangible assets was $8 million, compared to $259 million for fiscal 2002. Starting in fiscal 2003, we no longer record goodwill amortization as a result of the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142. Amortization charges were primarily related to the acquisition of SnapTrack in March 2000. Asset Impairment and Related Charges. For fiscal 2003, asset impairment and related charges were $34 million, compared to less than $1 million of such charges in fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, we recorded a $34 million impairment loss on our wireless licenses in Australia due to developments that affected potential strategic alternatives for using the spectrum. The impairment loss recognized was the difference between the assets’ carrying values and their estimated fair values. Other Operating Income. For fiscal 2003, other operating income was $30 million, compared to other operating expense of $9 million in fiscal 2002. Other operating income during fiscal 2003 resulted from $47 million of other income related to the transfer of portions of the FCC auction discount voucher’s value to two wireless operators, offset by a $16 million charge related to the write down of notes receivable from an early stage CDMA wireless operator and an early stage media company. Other operating expenses during fiscal 2002 resulted from the write down of a note receivable from an early stage CDMA wireless operator. 51 Table of Contents Net Investment Income (Expense). Net investment expense was $8 million for fiscal 2003, compared to $218 million for fiscal 2002. The change was primarily comprised as follows (in millions): Years Ended September 30, 2003* 2002* Change Interest income: QSI $ 45 $ 26 $ 19 Corporate and other segments 113 102 11 Interest expense (2 ) (1 ) (1 ) Net realized gains on investments: QSI 63 2 61 Corporate 17 — 17 Other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities (100 ) (206 ) 106 Other-than-temporary losses on other investments (28 ) (25 ) (3 ) Losses on derivative instruments (3 ) (58 ) 55 Minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries — (1 ) 1 Equity in losses of investees (113 ) (57 ) (56 ) $ (8 ) $ (218 ) $ 210 * As adjusted for discontinued operations. The increase in interest income on corporate cash and marketable securities was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates earned on these balances. The increase in QSI interest income was primarily the result of $23 million of deferred interest income recorded as a result of a prepayment on Pegaso debt facilities in fiscal 2003. The net realized gains on investments during fiscal 2003 primarily related to the sale of a portion of our investment in United Online. The other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities during fiscal 2003 primarily related to an $81 million impairment of our investment in a wireless operator in South Korea and a $16 million impairment of our investment in a provider of semiconductor packaging, test and distribution services. The other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities during fiscal 2002 primarily related to $162 million and $18 million in losses on our investments in Leap Wireless bonds and common stock, respectively. The losses on derivative instruments during fiscal 2002 primarily resulted from movements in the price of Leap Wireless common stock, which affected the fair values of our warrants to acquire Leap Wireless stock. Equity in losses of investees primarily increased due to an increase in losses incurred by Inquam, of which our share was $99 million for fiscal 2003 as compared to $45 million for fiscal 2002. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $536 million for fiscal 2003, compared to $97 million for fiscal 2002. The annual effective tax rate from continuing operations was approximately 34% for fiscal 2003, compared to a rate of 16% for fiscal 2002. The annual effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2003 was lower than the combined federal and state statutory tax rate of approximately 39%, primarily due to foreign earnings that were taxed at less than the United States federal rate. The reduction was partially offset by capital losses for which we had not recorded a tax benefit. The fiscal 2003 effective tax rate for continuing operations was higher than the fiscal 2002 effective tax rate for continuing operations primarily due to the reduction of valuation allowances in fiscal 2002 that were previously charged to income tax expense, partially offset by the amortization of non-deductible goodwill in fiscal 2002. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results of fiscal 2004 and 2003 for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 10 — Segment Information.” QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2004 were $3,094 million, compared to $2,406 million for fiscal 2003. Equipment and services revenues, primarily from MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, were $3,026 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $2,374 million for fiscal 2003. The increase in MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits revenue was comprised of $994 million related to higher unit shipments, partially offset by a 52 Table of Contents decrease of $331 million related to the effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Approximately 137 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2004, compared to approximately 99 million for fiscal 2003. QCT’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2004 were $1,043 million, compared to $797 million for fiscal 2003. QCT’s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage) was 34% in fiscal 2004, compared to 33% in fiscal 2003. The operating margin percentage in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 increased slightly primarily as a result of the increase in gross margin percentage, partially offset by a 40% increase in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. Research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses were $154 million higher and $54 million higher, respectively, for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily associated with increased investment in new integrated circuit products and technology research, development and marketing initiatives to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multiband, multimode, multinetwork products including CDMA2000 1xEV-DO, WCDMA and HSDPA. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2004 were $1,331 million, compared to $1,000 million for fiscal 2003. Royalty revenues from external licensees were $1,141 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $838 million in fiscal 2003. Royalty revenues recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151 million of royalties that were reported by external licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to us by external licensees in fiscal 2004 were $1,292 million, as compared to $837 million in fiscal 2003. Revenues from license fees were $59 million in both fiscal 2004 and 2003. Other revenues were comprised of intersegment royalties. During each of fiscal 2004 and 2003, we recognized $5 million in revenue related to equity received as license fees. The following table summarizes royalty related data for external licensees (in millions): Years Ended September 30, 2004 2003 Estimate recorded for the fourth quarter of the prior year (Prior Year Fourth Quarter) for Estimated Licensees $ 151 $ 150 Royalties reported in the first quarter of the current year by Estimated Licensees for Prior Year Fourth Quarter 208 167 Prior Year Fourth Quarter variance included in current year 57 17 Other royalties reported in current year 1,084 670 Estimate recorded for the fourth quarter of the current year for Estimated Licensees — 151 Total current year royalty revenues from external licensees $ 1,141 $ 838 For example, for fiscal 2003, we estimated royalties of $151 million from the Estimated Licensees for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. The actual royalties reported to us by the Estimated Licensees, on a one quarter lag basis, during the first quarter of fiscal 2004 were $208 million. The variance of $57 million recorded in royalty revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 was primarily attributable to greater phone sales at higher average prices by our Estimated Licensees than we had anticipated. To achieve these phone unit volumes, we believe that our Estimated Licensees reduced their integrated circuit inventories in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Total royalty revenues from licensees for fiscal 2004 of $1,141 million included: 1) the prior year fourth quarter variance of $57 million and 2) other royalties reported by licensees during fiscal 2004 of $1,084 million. We did not estimate royalty revenues for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as we no longer believe that we have the ability to reliably estimate such amounts. QTL’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2004 were $1,195 million, compared to $897 million for fiscal 2003. QTL’s operating margin percentage was 90% in fiscal 2004, compared to 89% in fiscal 2003. The increase in both revenues and earnings before taxes was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA products by licensees, resulting from higher demand for CDMA products across all major regions of CDMA deployment at higher average selling prices, partially offset by the change in our ability to estimate royalties. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2004 were $596 million, compared to $511 million for fiscal 2003. Revenues increased primarily due to a $58 million increase in QWBS revenue and a $37 million increase in QIS revenue. As a result of the adoption of EITF No. 00-21 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, QWBS started recording 53 Table of Contents revenue for certain equipment sales upon shipment instead of amortizing the related revenue over a future period. The amortization of QWBS equipment revenue that was deferred in the periods prior to the adoption of EITF No. 00-21 will continue with a declining impact through 2008. QWBS amortized $76 million in revenue related to such prior period equipment sales in fiscal 2004, compared to $95 million in fiscal 2003, including $23 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 after the adoption of EITF No. 00-21. The net increase in QWBS revenue is primarily attributable to the accounting change for certain equipment sales, with a smaller contribution from a $14 million increase in messaging revenue as a result of a larger installed base. QWBS shipped approximately 53,000 OmniTRACS and other related communications systems during fiscal 2004, compared to approximately 38,000 in fiscal 2003. The increase in QIS revenue is primarily attributable to a $53 million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products, partially offset by a $19 million decrease in QChat revenue resulting from the wind down of development efforts under the licensing agreement with Nextel. QWI’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2004 were $30 million, compared to $27 million for fiscal 2003. QWI’s operating margin percentage was 5% in both fiscal 2004 and 2003. The increase in QWI’s earnings before taxes was primarily due to a $31 million increase in QIS gross margin largely resulting from the increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products, offset by a $30 million increase in QWI research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. QWI’s operating margin percentage remained flat in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to a decline in QWBS gross margin percentage, offset by an improvement in QIS gross margin percentage. The decline in QWBS gross margin percentage in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 is primarily attributable to an increase in equipment sales, with margins that were lower than the margins on messaging services, as a percentage of total QWBS revenue. The improvement in QIS gross margin percentage is primarily attributable to the increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products. During the second quarter of fiscal 2004, QWBS began the process of moving high volume, standard product manufacturing to Mexico to reduce manufacturing costs. The low volume, prototype and new product manufacturing activities will remain in San Diego. The move is anticipated to be completed by the third quarter of fiscal 2005. QWBS may incur additional costs in the near term as a result of this move. In connection with this activity, we continue to evaluate other low cost manufacturing opportunities. QSI Segment. QSI’s losses before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 were $3 million, compared to $168 million for fiscal 2003. Equity in losses of investees decreased by $42 million primarily due to a decrease in losses incurred by Inquam during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, of which our share was $59 million for fiscal 2004 as compared to $99 million for fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2004, we recorded $12 million in other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities and other investments as compared to $127 million for fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2003, we also recorded a $34 million impairment loss on our wireless licenses in Australia due to developments that affected strategic alternatives for using the spectrum. These improvements in QSI’s losses before taxes were partially offset by a $31 million decrease in interest income resulting from the prepayment of the Pegaso debt facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2003 were $2,406 million, compared to $1,575 million for fiscal 2002. Equipment and services revenues, primarily from MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, were $2,374 million for fiscal 2003, compared to $1,546 million for fiscal 2002. The increase in MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits revenue was primarily related to higher unit shipments. Approximately 99 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2003, compared to approximately 65 million for fiscal 2002. QCT’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2003 were $797 million, compared to $438 million for fiscal 2002. QCT’s operating income as a percentage of its revenues was 33% in fiscal 2003, compared to 28% in fiscal 2002. The operating margin percentage in fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002 increased primarily as a result of the 53% increase in revenues as compared to the 17% increase in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. Research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses were $58 million higher and $17 million higher, respectively, for fiscal 2003 as compared to fiscal 2002, primarily associated with increased investment in new integrated circuit products and technology research, development and marketing initiatives to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multiband, multimode, multinetwork products including CDMA2000, 1xEV-DO/1xEV-DV and WCDMA. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2003 were $1,000 million, compared to $847 million for fiscal 2002. Royalty revenues from external licensees were $838 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $725 million in fiscal 2002. 54 Table of Contents Revenues from license fees were $59 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $55 million in fiscal 2002. Other revenues were comprised of intersegment royalties. During fiscal 2003, we recognized $5 million in revenue related to equity received as license fees, compared to $6 million in fiscal 2002. The following table summarizes royalty related data for external licensees (in millions): Years Ended September 30, 2003 2002 Estimate recorded for the fourth quarter of the prior year (Prior Year Fourth Quarter) for Estimated Licensees $ 150 $ 122 Royalties reported in the first quarter of the current year by Estimated Licensees for Prior Year Fourth Quarter 167 146 Prior Year Fourth Quarter variance included in current year 17 24 Other royalties reported in current year 670 551 Estimate recorded for the fourth quarter of the current year for Estimated Licensees 151 150 Total current year royalty revenues from external licensees $ 838 $ 725 For example, for fiscal 2002, we estimated royalties of $150 million from the Estimated Licensees for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. The actual royalties reported to us by the Estimated Licensees, on a one quarter lag basis, during the first quarter of fiscal 2003 were $167 million. The variance of $17 million recorded in royalty revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2003 was primarily attributable to greater phone sales at higher average prices by our Estimated Licensees than we had anticipated. Total royalty revenues from licensees for fiscal 2003 of $838 million included: 1) the prior year fourth quarter variance of $17 million, 2) other royalties reported by licensees during fiscal 2003 of $670 million and 3) the estimate made for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of $151 million based upon Estimated Licensees’ estimated sales during that quarter, which we estimated would be reported by the Estimated Licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. QTL’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2003 were $897 million, compared to $756 million for fiscal 2002. QTL’s operating margin percentage was 89% in both fiscal 2003 and 2002. The increase in both revenues and earnings before taxes was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA products by licensees, resulting from higher demand for CDMA products across all major regions of CDMA deployment. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2003 were $511 million, compared to $460 million for fiscal 2002. Revenues increased primarily due to a $19 million increase in QWBS revenue, an $11 million increase in revenue related to the sale of test equipment used primarily in testing WCDMA networks, a $10 million increase in QGOV revenue, primarily as a result of license revenue related to the sale of the Technicolor Digital Cinema, LLC joint venture, and an $11 million increase in software and services revenue related to our QPoint and BREW products. As a result of the adoption of EITF No. 00-21 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, QWBS started recording revenue for certain equipment sales upon shipment instead of amortizing the related revenue over a future period. QWBS amortized $95 million in revenue related to such prior period equipment sales in fiscal 2003, including $23 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 after the adoption of EITF No. 00-21, compared to $103 million in fiscal 2002. The net increase in QWBS revenue is primarily attributable to the accounting change for certain equipment sales and a $14 million increase in messaging revenue as a result of a larger installed base. QWBS shipped approximately 38,000 OmniTRACS and other related communications systems during fiscal 2003, compared to approximately 46,000 in fiscal 2002. QWI’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2003 were $27 million, compared to earnings before losses of $7 million for fiscal 2002. QWI’s operating margin percentage was 5% in fiscal 2003, compared to negative 1% in fiscal 2002. The increase in QWI’s earnings before taxes was primarily due to a $25 million increase in QWBS gross margin. The increase in QWBS gross margin was primarily attributable to $11 million in gross margin amortized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 related to equipment sales in prior periods, while equipment sales during the fourth quarter were recognized upon shipment, a $12 million increase in messaging services which have higher gross margins than equipment sales and the effect of a $6 million release of warranty reserves resulting from the substantial completion of a QWBS warranty program. The improvement in QWI’s operating margin percentage in fiscal 2003 as 55 Table of Contents compared to fiscal 2002 was primarily related to the decrease in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of QWI’s revenues. QSI Segment. QSI’s losses before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal 2003 were $168 million, compared to $346 million for fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, we recorded a $97 million decrease in other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities and a $55 million decrease in losses on derivative instruments. Equity in losses of investees increased by $56 million primarily due to an increase in losses incurred by Inquam, of which our share was $99 million for fiscal 2003 as compared to $45 million for fiscal 2002. During fiscal 2003, we also recorded other income of $47 million related to the transfer of portions of the FCC auction discount voucher value to two wireless operators, partially offset by a $34 million impairment loss on our wireless licenses in Australia due to developments that affected strategic alternatives for using the spectrum. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $7.6 billion at September 30, 2004, an increase of $2.3 billion from September 30, 2003. The increase during fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of $2.5 billion in cash provided by operating activities, $330 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans and $196 million in net collections on finance receivables, mainly comprised of the prepayment from Pegaso, partially offset by $332 million in capital expenditures, $308 million in dividend payments and $70 million invested in other entities and acquisitions. Accounts receivable increased by 20% during fiscal 2004. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increase in sales of integrated circuits, partially offset by the effect of the change in the timing of recognizing royalties. Days sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, were 43 days at September 30, 2004, compared to 48 days at September 30, 2003. The change in days sales outstanding is primarily attributable to the effect of the change in the timing of recognizing royalties. In February 2003, we authorized the expenditure of up to $1 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock over a two-year period. In fiscal 2003, we bought 9,830,000 shares at a net aggregate cost of $158 million. While we did not repurchase any of our common stock during fiscal 2004, we continue to evaluate repurchases under this program. In connection with our stock repurchase program, we sold put options in March 2004 that could have required us to purchase 3,000,000 shares of our common stock upon exercise. We repurchased all of the put options in July 2004. We recorded $5 million in premiums received for the put options as investment income. At September 30, 2004, $834 million remains authorized for repurchases under the program. We announced dividends totaling approximately $307 million and $135 million, or $0.190 and $0.085 per share, during fiscal 2004 and 2003, respectively. We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected working and other capital requirements for the foreseeable future based on current business plans, including investments in other companies and other assets to support the growth of our business, financing for customers of CDMA infrastructure products in accordance with the agreements with Ericsson, financing under agreements with CDMA telecommunications operators, other commitments, the payment of dividends and possible additional stock buy backs. We started construction of two facilities in San Diego, California in fiscal 2003, totaling approximately one million additional square feet, to meet the requirements projected in our long-term business plan. The remaining cost of these new facilities is expected to be approximately $250 million through fiscal 2007. We recently announced our plans to expand our current Network Operations Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, which uses GPS and other technologies to track freight transportation and shipping nationwide. We expect the cost of this expansion will be approximately $52 million through fiscal 2007. We expect to place the new and expanded facilities in service starting in fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2007. We intend to continue our strategic investment activities to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and the growth of CDMA-based wireless data and wireless Internet products, although to a lesser extent than in prior years. As part of these investment activities, we may provide financing to facilitate the marketing and sale of CDMA equipment by authorized suppliers. In the event additional needs for cash arise, we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including potential debt and equity issuance. During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we and the Other Investor in Inquam committed to fund an additional $2 million each. While we have no other obligations to provide funding to Inquam, we continue to have active discussions with Inquam and the Other Investor concerning the necessary funding for all or part of Inquam’s business 56 Table of Contents plan, potential restructuring and investment by other parties. While we may provide some additional funding and/or credit support in furtherance of Inquam’s business plan, the amount and form of such support is unknown, and none will be provided without commensurate support or consideration being provided by the Other Investor. Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or fully disclosed in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have no off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in S-K 303(a)(4)(ii). At September 30, 2004, our outstanding contractual obligations included (in millions): Contractual Obligations Payments Due By Period No Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Beyond Fiscal Expiration Total 2005 2006 - 2007 2008-2009 2009 Date Long-term financing under Ericsson arrangement (1) $ 118 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 118 Purchase obligations 949 885 60 4 — — Operating leases 111 45 52 11 3 — Equity investments (1) 19 — — — — 19 Inquam guarantee 28 28 — — — — Other commitments 1 1 — — — — Total commitments 1,226 959 112 15 3 137 Other long-term liabilities (2) 90 — 8 22 — 60 Total recorded liabilities 90 — 8 22 — 60 Total $ 1,316 $ 959 $ 120 $ 37 $ 3 $ 197 (1) These commitments do not have fixed funding dates. Amounts are presented based on the expiration of the commitment, but actual funding may occur earlier or not at all as funding is subject to certain conditions. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed or funded under these arrangements; actual financing or funding may be in lesser amounts. (2) Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenue, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 30, 2004 is provided in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3 — Composition of Certain Financial Statement Captions, Finance Receivables, Note 4 — Investments in Other Entities and Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies.” Future Accounting Requirements In June 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 02-14, “Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock.” EITF Issue No. 02-14 addresses whether the equity method of accounting applies when an investor does not have an investment in voting common stock of an investee but exercises significant influence through other means. EITF Issue No. 02-14 states that an investor should only apply the equity method of accounting when it has investments in either common stock or in-substance common stock of a corporation, provided that the investor has the ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The accounting provisions of EITF Issue No. 02-14 are effective for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of EITF Issue No. 02-14 will have on our financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 03-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” which provides new guidance for assessing impairment losses on debt and equity investments. Additionally, EITF Issue No. 03-1 includes new disclosure requirements for investments that are deemed to be temporarily impaired. In September 2004, the FASB delayed the accounting provisions of EITF Issue No. 03-1; however, the disclosure requirements remain effective and have been adopted for our year ended September 30, 2004. We will evaluate the effect, if any, of EITF 03-1 when final guidance is released. 57 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Interest Rate Market Risk. We have fixed income securities consisting of cash equivalents and investments in marketable debt securities. We also have diversified portfolios of non-investment grade securities managed by institutional portfolio managers, which are subject to a higher degree of default risk than our investment grade fixed income portfolios. Changes in the general level of United States interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed income investments. Our fixed income investments have grown significantly in size and are subject to interest rate risk and credit risk. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed income investments could lose value. If the general economy were to weaken significantly, the credit profile of issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios could deteriorate and our fixed income investments could lose value. We may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs that do not perform well. See “Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements — Marketable Securities” for information about investments in marketable debt securities. We have finance receivables and notes receivable (both included in other assets) that bear interest at fixed rates. See “Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements — Composition of Certain Financial Statement Captions” for information about finance receivables. Finance receivables and notes that bear interest at fixed rates could lose value if interest rates increase. The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our fixed income investment portfolio, the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted-average yield at cost. For our finance receivables and notes receivable, the table presents contractual interest rates by expected maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed that our fixed income securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes.

We hold a diversified portfolio of marketable securities, equity mutual fund shares and derivative instruments subject to equity price risk. The recorded values of marketable equity securities increased to $765 million at September 30, 2004 from $140 million at September 30, 2003. The recorded value of equity mutual fund shares was $296 million at September 30, 2004. The recorded value of derivative instrument assets, mainly comprised of warrants, subject to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133 (FAS 133) “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” at September 30, 2004 was $4 million. We generally invest in companies in the high-technology industry, and typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities. The portfolio’s concentrations in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time, and changes in concentrations may affect the portfolio’s price volatility. During the last three years, many technology stocks experienced significant decreases in value, negatively affecting the fair values of our 58 Table of Contents available-for-sale equity securities and derivative instruments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund shares at September 30, 2004 would cause a corresponding 10% decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities, or $106 million. Our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of investments in private early stage companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods. Accordingly, we believe that our exposure to market risk from these investments is not material. Additionally, we do not anticipate any near-term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management’s objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures. The recorded values of these strategic investments totaled $162 million at September 30, 2004. Additional information regarding our strategic investments is provided in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operating Results in this Annual Report. Foreign Exchange Market Risk. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, consisting primarily of foreign currency forward and option contracts. Derivative financial instruments are viewed as risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. At September 30, 2004, the value of our foreign currency forward contracts was insignificant, and there were no foreign currency option contracts outstanding. See “Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements — The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies. Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investees which are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies. Finance receivables and notes receivable from international operators and customers that do not use the United States dollar as their functional currencies subject us to credit risk. Because our financing is U.S. dollar denominated, any significant change in the value of the U.S. dollar against the debtors’ functional currencies could result in an increase in the debtor’s cash flow requirements and could thereby affect our ability to collect our receivables. At September 30, 2004, finance and note receivables from international operators and customers totaled $2 million, net of allowances. Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks.",2023-12-30 18:21:53.012944
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Recent Highlights Revenues for fiscal 2005 were $5.67 billion, with net income of $2.14 billion. The following recent developments occurred with respect to key elements of our business or our industry: • CDMA-based 3G subscribers to wireless operators’ services grew to at least 213 million worldwide through September 2005, including at least 15 million 1xEV-DO subscribers and at least 35 million WCDMA subscribers, according to data from a large portion of the wireless operators around the world. • CDMA-based handset shipments by manufacturers to wireless operators during the period July 2004 through June 2005 totaled approximately 182 million units at an average selling price of approximately $215 based on reports in fiscal 2005 by our licensees. • The ratio of WCDMA reported royalties to total reported royalties grew from approximately 26% reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 to approximately 41% reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. • Through October 2005, six manufacturers in China have been added, at our standard worldwide WCDMA royalty rates, to the more than 60 companies that have licensed our WCDMA patent portfolio. • During fiscal 2005, we shipped approximately 151 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) integrated circuits for CDMA-based phones and data modules (nearly all of which were 3G, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO and WCDMA) compared to approximately 137 million MSM integrated circuits in the prior fiscal year. During fiscal 2005, seven new customers selected our WCDMA (UMTS) MSM integrated circuits for their WCDMA phone products bringing the total number of WCDMA customers to 32, 16 of which have been publicly announced. • As of September 2005, 56 wireless operators were offering BREW services in 29 countries, including customers acquired related to the ELATA acquisition. As reported in June 2005, BREW publishers and developers have earned more than $350 million to date from the sale of wireless applications and services developed for the BREW service. Through September 2005, three operators, including ALLTEL, have entered into agreements to license our uiOne user interface technology. • During fiscal 2005, we continued to invest in new emerging technologies through strategic acquisitions and research and development. We completed four acquisitions this year, including Iridigm, Trigenix, Spike and ELATA, and announced our intent to acquire Flarion. Each of these acquisitions provides us complementary or expanded offerings to our existing technologies. • During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, MediaFLO conducted the first live, over-the-air demonstration of FLO technology. The demonstration featured over-the-air delivery and viewing of multiple channels of high quality (QVGA) wireless multimedia content, both streaming video and multicast packet data, on a wireless handset. Our Business and Operating Segments We design, manufacture and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our CDMA technology and other technologies. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, from license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property, from services and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related services. Operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. 39 Table of Contents We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments. These segments are: QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, or QCT; QUALCOMM Technology Licensing, or QTL; QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet, or QWI; and QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives, or QSI. QCT is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning. QCT’s integrated circuit products and software are used in wireless phones, data cards and infrastructure equipment. The wireless phone integrated circuits include the Mobile Station Modem (MSM), Radio Frequency (RF) and Power Management (PM) devices. The wireless phone integrated circuits and software perform voice and data communication, multimedia and global positioning functions, radio conversion between radio and baseband signals, and power management. The infrastructure equipment integrated circuits provide the core baseband CDMA modem functionality in the operator’s equipment. QCT software products are the operating systems that control the phone and the functionality imbedded in our integrated circuit products. QCT revenues comprised 58%, 64% and 63% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. QTL grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of CDMA products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA and/or the CDMA TDD standards and their derivatives. QTL receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating our intellectual property. QTL revenues comprised 32%, 27% and 26% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. QWI, which includes QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions (QWBS), QUALCOMM Internet Services (QIS) and QUALCOMM Government Technologies (QGOV), generates revenue primarily through mobile communication products and services, software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications. QWBS provides satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging, position reporting and wireless application services to transportation companies, private fleets, construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies. QIS provides BREW (Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) products and services, including the uiOne customizable user-interface product and the deliveryOne content distribution system, for the development and over-the-air deployment of data services on wireless devices. QIS also provides QChat and QPoint products and services. QChat enables virtually instantaneous push-to-chat functionality on CDMA-based wireless devices while QPoint enables operators to offer E-911 and location-based applications and services. The QGOV division provides development, hardware and analytical expertise to United States government agencies involving wireless communications technologies. QWI revenues comprised 11%, 12% and 13% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. QSI makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services. Our strategy is to invest in CDMA operators, licensed device manufacturers and start-up companies that we believe open new markets for CDMA technology, support the design and introduction of new CDMA-based products or possess unique capabilities or technology. Effective as of the beginning of fiscal 2005, we present the operating results of our wireless multimedia operator, MediaFLO USA, Inc. (MediaFLO USA), in the QSI segment. Our MediaFLO USA subsidiary expects to offer a nationwide mediacast network based on our FLO (Forward Link Only) technology and MediaFLO Media Distribution System (MDS), initially targeting 100 top domestic markets, with the eventual capability for broader nationwide coverage. This network is expected to be utilized as a shared resource for wireless operators and their customers within the United States starting in latter 2006. FLO is a multicast technology specifically designed for markets where dedicated spectrum is available and where regulations permit high-power transmission, thereby reducing the number of towers and related infrastructure required to provide market coverage. MediaFLO USA plans to use nationwide 700 MHz spectrum for which we hold licenses and will be procuring and distributing content which we will make available wholesale to our wireless operator customers. Distribution, marketing, billing and customer relationships are expected to remain services provided by our wireless operator customers. We are evaluating a number of corporate structuring options, including distributing our ownership interest in MediaFLO USA to our stockholders in a spin-off transaction. Nonreportable segments include the QUALCOMM Wireless Systems division, which sells products that operate on the Globalstar low-Earth-orbit satellite communications system and provides related services, the QUALCOMM MEMS Technologies division, comprised of the Iridigm business, a display technology company that we acquired in the first quarter of fiscal 2005, and other product initiatives. 40 Table of Contents Looking Forward We expect continued growth in demand for CDMA2000 and WCDMA products and services in markets around the world: • Operators on the CDMA2000 technology path are deploying 1xEV-DO and are preparing to deploy EV-DO Revision A. Many GSM operators are migrating their networks to WCDMA and are preparing to deploy HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access). The deployment of these 3G networks enables higher voice capacity and data rates, thereby supporting more minutes of use and data intensive applications like multimedia. • As of October 2005, 87 WCDMA networks have launched, as reported by the Global Mobile Suppliers Association, an international organization of WCDMA and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) suppliers. We expect that the WCDMA market will continue to expand as operators transition their subscribers to WCDMA devices on these WCDMA networks. • We expect that volume increases and growing competition among WCDMA phone manufacturers and WCDMA integrated circuit suppliers will help decrease WCDMA phone prices significantly and drive growth of WCDMA phone sales worldwide. • We expect that growing demand for advanced 3G phones and devices will continue to drive the need for increased multimedia MSM functionality. To meet this market need, we intend to continue to invest significant resources toward multimedia functionality. • We expect growing demand for low end phones to continue and have invested resources for single chip solutions which combine the baseband, radio frequency and power management chips into one package. We believe lower component counts and further integration will drive costs down and enable faster time to market to meet the increasing demand for low end phones. While we are moving aggressively to address the low end market more effectively with CDMA-based products, we still face significant competition from GSM-based products in this market. • We also expect growing demand for high end, multimedia phones with added functionality and capability at a high price point. • The expiration of royalty-sharing obligations under two agreements, one in fiscal 2005 and the other in fiscal 2006, will contribute to an increase in our royalty revenues in fiscal 2006 and beyond. • We will continue our development efforts with respect to our BREW applications development platform, our new MediaFLO Multimedia Distribution System (MDS) and FLO technology for low cost delivery of multimedia content to multiple subscribers simultaneously and our iMoD display technology. We are dependent upon the commercial deployment of 3G wireless communications equipment, products and services based on our CDMA technology to increase our revenues and market share. We continue to face significant competition from non-CDMA technologies, as well as competition from companies offering other CDMA-based products. Recent reports suggest that inflation could have adverse effects on the global economy and the capital markets. You should also refer to the Risk Factors included in this Annual Report for further discussion of these and other risks related to our business. Revenue Concentrations Revenues from customers in South Korea, Japan and the United States comprised 37%, 21% and 18%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005 as compared to 43%, 18% and 21%, respectively, in fiscal 2004, and 45%, 15% and 23%, respectively, in fiscal 2003. We distinguish revenue from external customers by geographic areas based on customer location. Revenues from customers in Japan increased as a percentage of total revenues, from 15% in fiscal 2003 to 18% in fiscal 2004 and 21% in fiscal 2005, due primarily to increased royalties reported by licensees in Japan resulting from the growth of CDMA2000 and WCDMA in Japan as well as their success in exporting products worldwide. Combined revenues from customers in South Korea and the United States decreased as a percentage of total revenues, from 68% in fiscal 2003 to 64% in fiscal 2004 and 55% in fiscal 2005, due primarily to increases in revenues from manufacturers of CDMA and WDCMA products in other regions such as China, Japan and Western Europe. 41 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets and investments, income taxes, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others. Revenue Recognition. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, from royalties and license fees for our intellectual property, from messaging and other services and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related services. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates. We license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of CDMA products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA and/or the CDMA TDD standards and their derivatives. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee, typically five to seven years. We earn royalties on such licensed CDMA products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees’ sales occur. Our licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter, and, in some instances, although royalties are reported quarterly, payment is on a semi-annual basis. During the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the quarter in which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made. Not all royalties earned were recorded based on estimates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we determined that, due to escalating and changing business trends, we no longer had the ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from the Estimated Licensees. These escalating and changing trends included the commercial launches and global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market share among licensees due to increased global competition, and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we began recognizing royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. As of September 25, 2005, our goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $571 million and $237 million, respectively. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. We assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our acquired businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. 42 Table of Contents We hold minority investments in publicly-traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile. These investments, which are recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally recorded through stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income or loss, totaled $1.16 billion at September 25, 2005. We record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future. When assessing a publicly-traded investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost, the performance of the investee’s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations. We also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties. In the event our judgments change as to other-than-temporary declines in value, we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, we recorded $12 million, $12 million and $100 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary losses on our minority investments in publicly-traded companies. We hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values are difficult to determine. These investments totaled $122 million at September 25, 2005. We record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future. When assessing investments in private companies for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the share price from the investee’s latest financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan, the investee’s revenue and cost trends, the liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn rate and market acceptance of the investee’s products and services. From time to time, we may consider third party evaluations, valuation reports or advice from investment banks. We also consider new products/services that the investee may have forthcoming, any significant news that has been released specific to the investee or the investee’s competitors and/or industry and the outlook of the overall industry in which the investee operates. In the event our judgments change as to other-than temporary declines in value, we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2005 and 2003, we recorded $1 million and $28 million, respectively, in other than temporary losses on our investments in private companies. Such losses were not significant in fiscal 2004. Income Taxes. Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. As part of our assessment of potential adjustments to our tax returns, we increase our current tax liability to the extent an adjustment would result in a cash tax payment or decrease our deferred tax assets to the extent an adjustment would not result in a cash tax payment. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. As of September 25, 2005, gross deferred tax assets were $937 million. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results. 43 Table of Contents As of September 25, 2005, we had gross deferred tax assets of $301 million related to capital loss carry forwards. We can only use capital losses to offset capital gains. Based upon our assessments of projected future capital gains and losses and related tax planning strategies, we expect that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all the capital losses that we have incurred through fiscal 2005. Therefore, we have provided a valuation allowance in the amount of $62 million for the portion of capital losses we do not expect to utilize. Adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses and capital gains are reflected in the period the change is made. We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States. No provision has been made for United States federal and state, or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of which is approximately $1.2 billion as of September 25, 2005. Should we repatriate foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is made. On October 22, 2004, the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Creation Act) was signed into law. The Jobs Creation Act created a temporary incentive for corporations in the United States to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we repatriated approximately $0.5 billion of foreign earnings qualifying under the Jobs Creation Act and recorded a related expense of approximately $35 million for federal and state income tax liabilities. The distribution does not change our intention to indefinitely reinvest earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries outside the United States. Litigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions. We estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. We have not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with our legal proceedings based on our belief that a liability, while possible, is not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations. Acquisitions In October 2004, we completed the acquisitions of Iridigm Display Corporation (Iridigm), a display technology company, for a total of approximately $160 million in cash and the exchange of stock options with an estimated aggregate fair value of approximately $17 million, and Trigenix Limited (Trigenix), a mobile user interface company for approximately $33 million in cash. The convergence of consumer electronics products, including cameras, MP3 players, camcorders, GPS receivers and game consoles into wireless devices is driving the increased adoption of 3G CDMA. Iridigm’s display technology, known as iMoD, enables advanced, high-resolution multimedia capabilities on all tiers of mobile devices, while providing substantial performance, power consumption and cost benefits, as compared to other alternative display technologies. Our acquisition of Iridigm is intended to accelerate the time-to-market for Iridigm’s display technology, which fits our overall strategy of rapidly increasing the capability of wireless devices while driving down cost, size and power consumption. In addition to having a better display, operators and device manufacturers need a secure and modular approach for customizing their phone user interfaces so they can brand and differentiate their handsets. Our acquisition of Trigenix complements our BREW offering by adding Trigenix’s user interface development tools, enhancing the capabilities of our BREW uiOne user interface and accelerating the time-to-market for new user interface features, such as multi-perspective window display technology. In August 2005, we completed the acquisition of ELATA, Ltd. (ELATA), a developer of mobile content delivery and device management software systems, for a total of approximately $57 million in cash. Our acquisition of ELATA will enable us to offer a unified mobile content delivery system to operators who desire an enhanced framework for managing, delivering and marketing rich wireless content. The ELATA single service delivery 44 Table of Contents framework, which leverages open standards interfaces to ensure interoperability and retain backward compatibility, is platform-agnostic and will allow operators to consolidate the delivery of all of their content services without having to change their device portfolio. This acquisition will also expand our presence in Europe by enabling us to offer European operators a content delivery system that can be easily integrated with their existing core network and business systems. The ELATA single service delivery framework has become part of our family of BREW product offerings and is being marketed under the brand name deliveryOne. In August 2005, we announced our intention to acquire Flarion Technologies, Inc. (Flarion), a developer of OFDMA technology. Upon completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated in the first half of fiscal 2006, pending regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, we estimate that we will pay approximately $545 million in consideration, consisting of approximately $272 million in shares of QUALCOMM stock, $235 million in cash, and the exchange of Flarion’s existing vested options and warrants with a fair value of approximately $38 million. Upon achievement of certain agreed upon milestones on or prior to the eighth anniversary of the close of this transaction, we may issue additional aggregate consideration of $205 million, consisting of approximately $173 million payable in cash to Flarion stockholders and $32 million in shares of QUALCOMM stock, which will be issued to Flarion option holders and warrant holders upon or following the exercise of such options and warrants. Our acquisition of Flarion is intended to broaden our ability to effectively support operators who may prefer an OFDMA or a hybrid OFDM/CDMA/WCDMA network alternative for differentiating their services. The addition of Flarion’s intellectual property and engineering resources will also supplement the resources that we have already dedicated over the years towards the development of OFDM/OFDMA technologies. Strategic Investments in our QSI Segment Our QSI segment makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services. QSI segment assets totaled $442 million at September 25, 2005, compared to $400 million at September 26, 2004. Our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, a wireless multimedia operator, is expected to begin commercial operations in latter 2006. We also enter into strategic relationships with CDMA wireless operators and developers of innovative technologies or products for the wireless communications industry. Due to financial and competitive challenges facing wireless operators, we cannot assure you that our investments in or loans to these operators will generate financial returns or that they will result in increased adoption or continued use of CDMA technologies. CDMA wireless operators to whom we have provided funding have limited operating histories, are faced with significant capital requirements and are highly leveraged and/or have limited financial resources. If these CDMA wireless operators are not successful, we may have to write down our investments in or loans to these operators. Our QSI segment maintains strategic investments in marketable equity securities classified as available-for-sale. We strategically invest in companies in the high-technology industry and typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to market risks in these investments. The fair values of these strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market price volatility. Our strategic investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time, and changes in concentrations may affect price volatility. Downward fluctuations and market trends could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the realizable value of these securities and derivative instruments is subject to market and other conditions. QSI also makes strategic investments in privately held companies, including early stage companies and venture funds. These investments are comprised of equity investments, recorded at cost or under the equity method, and warrants that are recorded at fair value or at cost. The recorded values of these investments may be written down due to changes in the companies’ conditions or prospects. These strategic investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products the investees are developing may never materialize. As a result, we could lose all or a portion of our investments in these companies, which could negatively affect our financial position and operating results. Most of these strategic investments will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment, if at all. To the extent such investments become liquid and meet strategic and price objectives, we may sell the investments and recognize the realized gain (loss) in investment income (expense). We regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our investments in both marketable and private securities. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other than temporary, we will record a charge to investment income (expense). In some cases, we make strategic investments that require us to consolidate or record our equity in the losses of early stage companies. The consolidation of these losses can adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to the investments. 45 Table of Contents Key developments in our strategic investments during fiscal 2005 included our ongoing investment in our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, a slow down in the rate of strategic investment, including our investment in Inquam, and realized gains on certain strategic investments. Investment in Inquam Limited. Since October 2000, we and another investor (the Other Investor) have provided equity and debt funding to Inquam Limited (Inquam). Inquam owns, develops and manages wireless CDMA-based communications systems, either directly or indirectly, primarily in Romania and Portugal. We recorded $33 million, $59 million and $99 million in equity in losses of Inquam during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. At September 25, 2005, our equity and debt investments in Inquam totaled $26 million, net of equity in losses, and we had no remaining funding commitment under our bridge loan agreement. During fiscal 2005, Inquam secured new long-term financing (the new facilities). We and the Other Investor each guaranteed 50% of a portion of the amounts owed under certain of the new facilities, up to a combined maximum of $54 million. Amounts outstanding under the new facilities subject to the guarantee totaled $49 million as of September 25, 2005. The guarantee expires and the new facilities mature on December 25, 2011. In October 2005, we and the Other Investor agreed to restructure Inquam. Upon close of the restructuring, which is expected to occur in the first half of fiscal 2006, the Portugal companies will be spun-off through the exchange of portions of our and the Other Investor’s debt investments for direct equity interests in the Portugal companies. Inquam, which will continue to own the Romania companies, will repurchase certain minority equity interests. Immediately after the restructuring, we will hold an approximate 49.7% equity interest in Inquam and a 23% equity interest in the Portugal companies, which is expected to be reduced over time as the Other Investor makes the further investments in the Portugal companies contemplated by the restructuring agreements. In addition, we and the Other Investor will have a put-call option arrangement. Under this arrangement, the Other Investor will have the right to buy our equity and debt investments in Inquam, subject to certain conditions, by exercising its call option, which will expire no later than May 14, 2008. The minimum purchase price will be approximately $66 million. In the event that the Other Investor’s call option expires, or in certain other circumstances prior to that date, we will have the right to sell our equity and debt investments in Inquam to the Other Investor at a minimum sales price of $66 million. Such right will expire after six months. We do not anticipate providing any further funding to Inquam or to the Portugal companies. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2005 were $5.67 billion, compared to $4.88 billion for fiscal 2004. Revenues from LG Electronics, Samsung and Motorola, customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI segments, comprised an aggregate of 15%, 13% and 11% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2005, compared to 15%, 15% and 10% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2004. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2005 were $3.74 billion, compared to $3.51 billion for fiscal 2004. Revenues from sales of integrated circuits increased $165 million, resulting primarily from an increase of $396 million related to higher unit shipments of MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, partially offset by a decrease of $241 million related to the effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Revenues from the sale of satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging systems and related messaging services increased $25 million and revenues from the sale of satellite portable phones that operate on the Globalstar low-Earth-orbit satellite communications system increased $19 million. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2005 were $1.93 billion, compared to $1.37 billion for fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the QTL segment recorded royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the year, as compared to the method used during the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 of recording royalty revenues from certain licensees based on estimates of royalty revenues earned by those licensees during the quarter. The increase in royalty revenue year to year resulted primarily from a $350 million increase in royalties reported to us by our external licensees and the effect of changing the timing of recognizing royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalty revenues recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151 million of royalties that were reported by external licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to us by external licensees in fiscal 2005 were $1.64 billion, as compared to $1.29 billion in fiscal 2004. The increase in royalties reported to us by external licensees was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA products by licensees, resulting from higher worldwide demand for CDMA products at higher average selling prices due primarily to the growth in sales of high-end WCDMA products and shifts in the geographic distribution of sales of CDMA products. 46 Table of Contents Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2005 was $1.65 billion, compared to $1.48 billion for fiscal 2004. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 44% for fiscal 2005, compared to 42% for fiscal 2004. The margin percentage decline in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to a 1.3% decrease in QCT margin percentage. Increases in product support costs and the reserves for excess and obsolete inventory contributed 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively, to the total decrease in QCT margin percentage. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues may fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold and services provided, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2005, research and development expenses were $1.01 billion or 18% of revenues, compared to $720 million or 15% of revenues for fiscal 2004. The dollar and percentage increases in research and development expenses primarily resulted from a $275 million increase in costs related to integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support lower cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA, GSM/GPRS/EDGE and OFDMA, and the development of our FLO technology, MediaFLO MDS and iMoD display products using MEMS technology. We expect that research and development costs will increase in fiscal 2006 as we continue our active support of CDMA-based technologies, products and network operations and other product initiatives. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses were $631 million or 11% of revenues, compared to $547 million or 11% of revenues for fiscal 2004. The dollar increase was primarily due to a $38 million increase in professional fees, primarily patent administration and outside consultants, a $33 million increase in employee-related expenses, and a $13 million decrease in other income. Net Investment Income. Net investment income was $423 million for fiscal 2005, compared to $184 million for fiscal 2004. The change was primarily comprised as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 25, September 26, 2005 2004 Change Interest and dividend income: QSI $ 4 $ 14 $ (10 ) Corporate and other segments 252 161 91 Interest expense (3 ) (2 ) (1 ) Net realized gains on investments: QSI 101 56 45 Corporate 78 32 46 Other-than-temporary losses on investments (14 ) (12 ) (2 ) Gains on derivative instruments 33 7 26 Equity in losses of investees (28 ) (72 ) 44 $ 423 $ 184 $ 239 The increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates earned on interest-bearing securities. Net realized gains on corporate investments increased primarily as a result of an increase in the positive performance of marketable equity securities as a percentage of total corporate investments in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004. The increase in net realized gains on strategic investments in QSI resulted primarily from a $48 million gain on our minority investment in a wireless publisher and a $41 million gain on the sale of our investment in NextWave Telecom Inc. Gains and losses on derivative instruments in both fiscal 2005 and 2004 related primarily to changes in the fair values of put options sold in connection with our stock repurchase program. Equity in losses of investees decreased primarily due to a decrease in losses incurred by Inquam, of which our share was $33 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to $59 million for fiscal 2004. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $666 million for fiscal 2005, compared to $588 million for fiscal 2004. The annual effective tax rate for continuing operations was approximately 24% for fiscal 2005, compared to 25% for fiscal 2004. The annual effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 was lower than the annual effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate. 47 Table of Contents The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was 11% lower than the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 10% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, 3% related to an increase in tax benefits resulting from our increased ability to use our capital loss carryforwards and 2% related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by state taxes of approximately 4%. As of September 25, 2005, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $62 million on previously incurred capital losses due to uncertainty as to our ability to generate sufficient capital gains to utilize all capital losses. We will continue to assess the realizability of capital losses. The amount of the valuation allowance on capital losses may be adjusted in the future as our ability to utilize capital losses changes. A change in the valuation allowance may impact the provision for income taxes in the period the change occurs. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2004 were $4.88 billion, compared to $3.85 billion for fiscal 2003. Revenues from Samsung, LG Electronics and Motorola, customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI segments, comprised an aggregate of 15%, 15% and 10% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2004, compared to 17%, 13% and 13% of total consolidated revenues, respectively, in fiscal 2003. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2004 were $3.51 billion, compared to $2.86 billion for fiscal 2003. Revenues from sales of integrated circuits increased $652 million, resulting primarily from an increase of $994 million related to higher unit shipments of MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, partially offset by a decrease of $331 million related to the effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2004 were $1.37 billion, compared to $985 million for fiscal 2003. The increase resulted primarily from higher QTL segment royalties, resulting primarily from an increase in phone and infrastructure equipment sales by our licensees at higher average selling prices, partially offset by the effect of the change in timing of recognizing royalties to an “as reported” method during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalty revenues recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151 million of royalties that were reported by licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to us by licensees in fiscal 2004 were $1.29 billion as compared to $837 million in fiscal 2003. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2004 was $1.48 billion, compared to $1.27 billion for fiscal 2003. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 42% for fiscal 2004, compared to 44% for fiscal 2003. The margin percentage improvement in fiscal 2004 compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily due to the increase in QCT revenues as a percentage of total equipment and services revenues, resulting in increased QCT margin relative to the total. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2004, research and development expenses were $720 million or 15% of revenues, compared to $523 million or 14% of revenues for fiscal 2003. The dollar and percentage increases in research and development expenses primarily resulted from a $187 million increase in costs related to integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA and GSM/GPRS/EDGE, and the development of our FLO technology and MediaFLO MDS. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2004, selling, general and administrative expenses were $547 million or 11% of revenues, compared to $483 million or 13% of revenues for fiscal 2003. The dollar increase was primarily due to a $61 million increase in employee-related expenses, a $21 million increase in professional fees, primarily patent administration and outside consultants, and a $12 million increase related to a charitable grant to an educational institution for the primary purpose of furthering the study of engineering and math, partially offset by the effect of a $34 million impairment loss recorded in fiscal 2003 on our wireless licenses in Australia due to developments that affected potential strategic alternatives for using the spectrum. The impairment loss recognized was the difference between the assets’ carrying values and their estimated fair values. 48 Table of Contents Net Investment Income (Expense). Net investment income was $184 million for fiscal 2004, compared to net investment expense of $8 million for fiscal 2003. The change was primarily comprised as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 26, September 28, 2004 2003 Change Interest and dividend income: QSI $ 14 $ 45 $ (31 ) Corporate and other segments 161 113 48 Interest expense (2 ) (2 ) — Net realized gains on investments: QSI 56 63 (7 ) Corporate 32 17 15 Other-than-temporary losses on investments (12 ) (128 ) 116 Gains (losses) on derivative instruments 7 (3 ) 10 Equity in losses of investees (72 ) (113 ) 41 $ 184 $ (8 ) $ 192 The increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates earned on interest-bearing securities, and $6 million in interest income recorded as a result of a refund from the United States Internal Revenue Service. The decrease in QSI interest income was primarily the result of the prepayment on the Pegaso debt facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. The other-than-temporary losses on investments during fiscal 2003 primarily related to an $81 million impairment of our investment in a wireless operator in South Korea and a $16 million impairment of our investment in a provider of semiconductor packaging, test and distribution services. Equity in losses of investees decreased primarily due to a decrease in losses incurred by Inquam, of which our share was $59 million for fiscal 2004 as compared to $99 million for fiscal 2003. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $588 million for fiscal 2004, compared to $536 million for fiscal 2003. The annual effective tax rate for continuing operations was approximately 25% for fiscal 2004, compared to 34% for fiscal 2003. The annual effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2004 was lower than the 2003 effective tax rate for continuing operations primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate, an increase in tax benefits recorded arising from our increased ability to use capital loss carryforwards and the reduction of QTL earnings, which are taxed at a rate that is lower than our effective tax rate, as a percentage of total earnings due to the change in the timing of recognizing QTL royalties. Foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate were higher in fiscal 2004 primarily due to the adjustment of an intercompany royalty agreement and an increase in foreign earnings. The annual effective tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal 2004 was 10% lower than the United States federal statutory rate due primarily to a benefit of approximately 14% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, research and development tax credits and our increased ability to use capital loss carryforwards, partially offset by state taxes of 4%. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results of fiscal 2005 and 2004 for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 10 — Segment Information.” QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2005 were $3.29 billion, compared to $3.11 billion for fiscal 2004. Equipment and services revenues, primarily from MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, were $3.20 billion for fiscal 2005, compared to $3.04 billion for fiscal 2004. The increase in integrated circuits revenue was comprised of $396 million related to higher unit shipments, partially offset by a decrease of $241 million related to the effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Approximately 151 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2005, compared to approximately 137 million for fiscal 2004. 49 Table of Contents QCT’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2005 were $852 million, compared to $1.05 billion for fiscal 2004. QCT’s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage) was 26% in fiscal 2005, compared to 34% in fiscal 2004. The decline in operating margin percentage in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of a 45% increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004, mainly related to increased investment in new integrated circuit products and technology research and development initiatives to support lower cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA and GSM/GPRS/EDGE. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2005 were $1.84 billion, compared to $1.33 billion for fiscal 2004. QTL’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2005 were $1.66 billion, compared to $1.20 billion for fiscal 2004. QTL’s operating margin percentage was 90% during both fiscal 2005 and 2004. The increase in both revenues and earnings before taxes primarily resulted from a $350 million increase in royalties reported to us by our external licensees and the effect of changing the timing of recognizing royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalty revenues recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151 million of royalties that were reported by external licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to us by external licensees in fiscal 2005 were $1.64 billion, as compared to $1.29 billion in fiscal 2004. The increase in royalties reported to us by external licensees was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA products by licensees, resulting from higher worldwide demand for CDMA products at higher average selling prices due primarily to the growth of higher priced WCDMA sales and shifts in the geographic distribution of sales of CDMA products. Revenues from license fees were $69 million in fiscal 2005, as compared to $59 million in fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, we recognized $4 million in revenue related to equity received as license fees, compared to $5 million in fiscal 2004. Other revenues were comprised of intersegment royalties. During the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the quarter in which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made. Not all royalties earned were recorded based on estimates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we determined that, due to escalating and changing business trends, we no longer had the ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from the Estimated Licensees. These escalating and changing trends included the commercial launches and global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market share among licensees due to increased global competition, and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we began recognizing royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Accordingly, we did not estimate royalty revenues earned in fiscal 2005. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2005 were $644 million, compared to $571 million for fiscal 2004. Revenues increased primarily due to a $37 million increase in QIS revenue and a $27 million increase in QWBS revenue. The increase in QIS revenue was primarily attributable to a $41 million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products. The increase in QWBS revenue was primarily attributable to a $16 million increase in equipment revenue, net of a $24 million decrease in amortization of deferred revenues related to historical equipment sales, and a $10 million increase in related messaging services revenue. QWBS shipped approximately 46,800 satellite-based systems and 62,500 terrestrial-based systems during fiscal 2005, compared to approximately 43,400 satellite-based systems and 10,000 terrestrial-based systems in fiscal 2004. QWI’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2005 were $57 million, compared to $19 million for fiscal 2004. QWI’s operating margin percentage was 9% in fiscal 2005, compared to 3% in fiscal 2004. The increases in QWI earnings before taxes and operating percentage were primarily due to a $39 million increase in QIS gross margin largely resulting from the increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products. During fiscal 2005, QWBS completed the process of moving high volume, standard product manufacturing to Mexico to reduce manufacturing costs. The low volume, prototype and new product manufacturing activities remains in San Diego. We continue to evaluate other low cost manufacturing opportunities. QSI Segment. QSI’s earnings before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 were $10 million, compared to losses before taxes from continuing operations of $31 million for fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, QSI recorded $101 million in realized gains on marketable securities and other investments, compared to $56 million in fiscal 2004. Equity in losses of investees decreased by $43 million primarily due to a decrease in losses incurred by 50 Table of Contents Inquam during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004, of which our share was $33 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to $59 million for fiscal 2004. These improvements in QSI’s earnings before taxes from continuing operations were partially offset by a $42 million increase in MediaFLO USA operating expenses. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results of fiscal 2004 and 2003 for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 10 — Segment Information.” QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2004 were $3.11 billion, compared to $2.43 billion for fiscal 2003. Equipment and services revenues, primarily from MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, were $3.04 billion for fiscal 2004, compared to $2.39 billion for fiscal 2003. The increase in integrated circuits revenue was comprised of $994 million related to higher unit shipments, partially offset by a decrease of $331 million related to the effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Approximately 137 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2004, compared to approximately 99 million for fiscal 2003. QCT’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2004 were $1.05 billion, compared to $805 million for fiscal 2003. QCT’s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage) was 34% in fiscal 2004, compared to 33% in fiscal 2003. The operating margin percentage in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 increased slightly primarily as a result of the increase in gross margin percentage, partially offset by a 40% increase in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. Research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses were $153 million higher and $55 million higher, respectively, for fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily associated with increased investment in new integrated circuit products and technology research, development and marketing initiatives to support multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA and GSM/GPRS/EDGE. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2004 were $1.33 billion, compared to $1.00 billion for fiscal 2003. Royalty revenues from external licensees were $1.14 billion in fiscal 2004, compared to $838 million in fiscal 2003. QTL’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2004 were $1.20 billion, compared to $897 million for fiscal 2003. QTL’s operating margin percentage was 90% in fiscal 2004, compared to 89% in fiscal 2003. The increase in both revenues and earnings before taxes primarily resulted from a $455 million increase in royalties reported to us by our external licensees, partially offset by the change in our ability to estimate royalties. Royalty revenues recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151 million of royalties that were reported by external licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to us by external licensees in fiscal 2004 were $1.29 billion, as compared to $837 million in fiscal 2003. The increase in royalties reported to us by external licensees was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA products by licensees, resulting from higher demand for CDMA products across all major regions of CDMA deployment at higher average selling prices. Revenues from license fees were $59 million in both fiscal 2004 and 2003. During each of fiscal 2004 and 2003, we recognized $5 million in revenue related to equity received as license fees. Other revenues were comprised of intersegment royalties. During the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the quarter in which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made. Not all royalties earned were recorded based on estimates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we determined that, due to escalating and changing business trends, we no longer had the ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from the Estimated Licensees. These escalating and changing trends included the commercial launches and global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market share among licensees due to increased global competition, and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we began recognizing royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2004 were $571 million, compared to $484 million for fiscal 2003. Revenues increased primarily due to a $58 million increase in QWBS revenue and a $37 million increase in QIS revenue. The increase in QWBS revenue was primarily attributable to a $14 million increase in messaging revenue as a result of a larger installed base and a $44 million increase in equipment revenue, net of an $19 million decrease in amortization of deferred revenues related to historical equipment sales. QWBS shipped approximately 43,400 51 Table of Contents satellite-based systems and 10,000 terrestrial-based systems during fiscal 2004, compared to approximately 32,200 satellite-based systems and 5,300 terrestrial-based systems in fiscal 2003. The increase in QIS revenue is primarily attributable to a $53 million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products, partially offset by a $19 million decrease in QChat revenue resulting from the wind down of development efforts under the licensing agreement with Nextel. QWI’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2004 were $19 million, compared to $15 million for fiscal 2003. QWI’s operating margin percentage was 3% in both fiscal 2004 and 2003. The increase in QWI’s earnings before taxes was primarily due to a $31 million increase in QIS gross margin largely resulting from the increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products, offset by a $29 million increase in QWI research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. QWI’s operating margin percentage remained flat in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 primarily due to a decline in QWBS gross margin percentage, offset by an improvement in QIS gross margin percentage. The decline in QWBS gross margin percentage in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003 was primarily attributable to a decline in the gross margin percentage on equipment sales, which are lower than the margins on messaging services, combined with an increase in equipment sales as a percentage of total QWBS revenue. The improvement in QIS gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to the increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products. QSI Segment. QSI’s losses before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 were $31 million, compared to $168 million for fiscal 2003. Equity in losses of investees decreased by $42 million primarily due to a decrease in losses incurred by Inquam during fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003, of which our share was $59 million for fiscal 2004 as compared to $99 million for fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2004, we recorded $12 million in other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities and other investments as compared to $127 million for fiscal 2003. During fiscal 2003, we also recorded a $34 million impairment loss on our wireless licenses in Australia due to developments that affected strategic alternatives for using the spectrum. These improvements in QSI’s losses before taxes were partially offset by a $31 million decrease in interest income resulting from the prepayment of the Pegaso debt facility in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and $28 million in MediaFLO USA operating expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $8.7 billion at September 25, 2005, an increase of $1.0 billion from September 26, 2004. The increase was primarily the result of $2.7 billion in cash provided by operating activities and $386 million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans, partially offset by $953 million in repurchases of our common stock under our stock repurchase program, $576 million in capital expenditures, $524 million in dividends paid and $249 million invested in other entities and acquisitions. On March 8, 2005, we authorized the repurchase of up to $2 billion of our common stock under a stock repurchase program with no expiration date. Through November 2, 2005, we repurchased and retired approximately 27,083,000 shares of our common stock for $953 million. In connection with this stock repurchase program, we have two put options outstanding, with expiration dates of December 7, 2005 and March 21, 2006, that may require us to repurchase 11,500,000 shares for $411 million (net of the option premiums received). At November 2, 2005, $636 million remained authorized for repurchases under our stock repurchase program. We announced dividends totaling $524 million, $307 million and $135 million, or $0.320, $0.190 and $0.085 per share, during fiscal 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. On October 10, 2005, we announced a cash dividend of $0.09 per share on our common stock, payable on January 4, 2006 to stockholders of record as of December 7, 2005. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. Accounts receivable decreased by 6% during fiscal 2005. Days sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, were 30 days at September 25, 2005, compared to 43 days at September 26, 2004. The change in days sales outstanding is consistent with the increase in revenue and the decrease in accounts receivable resulting from cash collections. We started construction of two facilities in San Diego, California in fiscal 2003, totaling approximately one million additional square feet, to meet the requirements projected in our business plan. The remaining cost of these new facilities is expected to be approximately $149 million through fiscal 2007. In fiscal 2005, we announced our plans to expand our backup Network Management Center in Las Vegas, Nevada, which uses satellite and terrestrial-based technologies to track freight transportation and shipping nationwide. We expect the remaining cost of this expansion will be approximately $35 million through fiscal 2008. In fiscal 2005, our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, a 52 Table of Contents wireless multimedia operator, began the development of a nationwide mediacast network based on our FLO technology and MediaFLO MDS. As part of this development, MediaFLO USA has executed a number of lease agreements at broadcast tower sites and has begun the installation of equipment and leasehold improvements at some of these sites. The remaining costs for our existing tower sites under lease, including equipment and leasehold improvements as well as the costs of installation, are expected to be approximately $18 million through fiscal 2006. On August 11, 2005, we announced our intention to acquire Flarion, a developer of OFDMA technology. Upon completion of the acquisition, which is anticipated in the first half of fiscal 2006, pending regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions, we estimate that we will pay approximately $545 million in consideration, including approximately $235 million in cash. Upon achievement of certain agreed upon milestones on or prior to the eighth anniversary of the close of this transaction, we may issue additional aggregate consideration of $205 million, including approximately $173 million payable in cash, to Flarion stockholders. We intend to continue our strategic investment activities to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and the growth of CDMA-based wireless data and wireless Internet products. As part of these investment activities, we may provide financing or other support to facilitate the marketing and sale of CDMA equipment by authorized suppliers. In the event additional needs for cash arise, we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including potential debt and equity issuance. We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected working and other capital requirements for the foreseeable future based on current business plans, including acquisitions, investments in other companies and other assets to support the growth of our business, financing and other commitments, the payment of dividends and possible additional stock repurchases. Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets or fully disclosed in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in S-K 303(a)(4)(ii). At September 25, 2005, our outstanding contractual obligations included (in millions): Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Beyond No Expiration Total 2006 2007-2008 2009-2010 Fiscal 2010 Date Long-term financing under Ericsson arrangement (1) $ 118 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 118 Purchase obligations 1,042 750 286 6 — — Operating leases 193 67 75 29 22 — Equity investments (1) 13 — — — — 13 Inquam guarantee 27 — — — 27 — Other commitments 1 1 — — — — Total commitments 1,394 818 361 35 49 131 Capital leases (2) 2 — — — 2 — Other long-term liabilities (3) 40 — 40 — — — Total recorded liabilities 42 — 40 — 2 — Total $ 1,436 $ 818 $ 401 $ 35 $ 51 $ 131 (1) These commitments do not have fixed funding dates. Amounts are presented based on the expiration of the commitment, but actual funding may occur earlier or not at all as funding is subject to certain conditions. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed or funded under these arrangements; actual financing or funding may be in lesser amounts. (2) Amounts represent future minimum lease payments not including interest payments. (3) Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenue, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 25, 2005 is provided in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4 — Investments in Other Entities and Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies.” 53 Table of Contents Future Accounting Requirements In December 2004, the FASB revised Statement No. 123 (FAS 123R), “Share-Based Payment,” which requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of employee stock options and similar awards. On April 14, 2005, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a new rule amending the compliance dates for FAS 123R. In accordance with the new rule, the accounting provisions of FAS 123R will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2006. We tentatively expect to adopt the provisions of FAS 123R using a modified prospective application. FAS 123R, which provides certain changes to the method for valuing share-based compensation among other changes, will apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date and are subsequently modified or cancelled. Compensation expense for outstanding awards for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for pro forma disclosure purposes under FAS 123. At September 25, 2005, unamortized compensation expense related to outstanding unvested options, as determined in accordance with FAS 123, that we expect to record during fiscal 2006 was approximately $394 million before income taxes. We will incur additional expense during fiscal 2006 related to new awards granted during fiscal 2006 that cannot yet be quantified. We are in the process of determining how the guidance regarding valuing share-based compensation as prescribed in FAS 123R will be applied to valuing share-based awards granted after the effective date and the impact that the recognition of compensation expense related to such awards will have on our financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Market Risk. We invest most of our cash in a number of diversified investment and non-investment grade fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Changes in the general level of United States interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed income investments. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed income investments could lose value. If the general economy were to weaken significantly, the credit profile of issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios could deteriorate, and our investments could lose value. We may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs that do not perform well. The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our interest bearing securities, the table presents principal cash flows, weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes. 54 Table of Contents Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal Amount by Expected Maturity Average Interest Rates (Dollars in millions) No Single Fair 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Maturity Total Value Fixed interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 608 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 608 $ 608 Interest rate 3.6 % Held-to-maturity securities $ 60 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 60 $ 60 Interest rate 2.1 % Available-for-sale securities: Investment grade $ 2,266 $ 336 $ 221 $ 9 $ 20 $ 9 $ 213 $ 3,074 $ 3,074 Interest rate 3.4 % 3.7 % 4.1 % 4.4 % 4.1 % 6.7 % 4.5 % Non-investment grade $ 2 $ 5 $ 24 $ 48 $ 38 $ 573 $ — $ 690 $ 690 Interest rate 6.5 % 7.5 % 7.3 % 7.3 % 8.2 % 7.9 % Floating interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,364 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,364 $ 1,364 Interest rate 3.7 % Held-to-maturity securities $ 70 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 70 $ 70 Interest rate 1.4 % Available-for-sale securities: Investment grade $ 174 $ 289 $ 131 $ 26 $ 13 $ 49 $ 552 $ 1,234 $ 1,234 Interest rate 3.6 % 3.7 % 3.6 % 3.5 % 4.0 % 4.3 % 4.1 % Non-investment grade $ — $ 6 $ — $ 3 $ 2 $ 17 $ — $ 28 $ 28 Interest rate 4.9 % 6.4 % 7.1 % 8.5 % Equity Price Market Risk. We invest in a number of diversified marketable securities and mutual fund shares subject to equity price risk. The recorded values of marketable equity securities increased to $1.16 billion at September 25, 2005 from $765 million at September 26, 2004. The recorded value of equity mutual fund shares decreased to $293 million at September 25, 2005 from $296 million at September 26, 2004. Our diversified investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time, and changes in the concentrations of these investments may affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund shares at September 25, 2005 would cause a corresponding 10% decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities, or $145 million. Our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of investments in private early stage companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods. Accordingly, we believe that our exposure to market risk from these investments is not material. Additionally, we do not anticipate any near-term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management’s objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures. The recorded values of these strategic investments totaled $121 million at September 25, 2005, as compared to $162 million at September 26, 2004. We hold warrants to acquire equity interests in certain strategic investees that are subject to equity price risk. Substantially all of these warrants are recorded at fair value in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities.” The recorded values of warrants held at September 25, 2005 totaled $1 million, as compared to $4 million at September 26, 2004. In connection with our stock repurchase program, we sell put options that may require us to repurchase shares of our common stock at fixed prices. These written put options subject us to equity price risk. At September 25, 2005, two put options were outstanding, which expire on December 7, 2005 and March 21, 2006, that may require us to repurchase 11,500,000 shares of our common stock upon exercise for $411 million (net of the option premiums received). The put option liabilities, with a fair value of $7 million at September 25, 2005, were included in other current liabilities. If the fair value of our common stock at September 25, 2005 decreased by 10%, the put options would expire unexercised resulting in $7 million in investment income. If the fair value of our common stock at September 25, 2005 decreased by 25%, the amount required to physically settle the put options would exceed the fair value of the shares repurchased by approximately $25 million, net of the $23 million in premiums received. Additional information regarding our strategic investments is provided in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operating Results in this Annual Report. 55 Table of Contents Foreign Exchange Market Risk. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, consisting primarily of foreign currency forward and option contracts. Such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. At September 25, 2005, we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. At September 25, 2005, the recorded values of our foreign currency option contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of CDMA and WCDMA products were $16 million. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in each of our hedged foreign currencies, we would incur a loss of approximately $6 million resulting from a decrease in fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective. See “Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements - The Company and its Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies. Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investees which are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies. Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks.",2023-12-30 18:21:45.112674
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Recent Highlights Revenues for fiscal 2006 were $7.53 billion, with net income of $2.47 billion. The following recent developments occurred with respect to key elements of our business or our industry: During fiscal 2006: • Worldwide wireless subscribers grew by more than 24% to reach approximately 2.5 billion. (1) • CDMA subscribers, including both 2G (cdmaOne) and 3G (CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO and WCDMA), grew to 17% of total worldwide wireless subscribers to date. (1) • 3G subscribers (all CDMA-based) grew to approximately 402 million worldwide through September 2006, including approximately 272 million CDMA2000 1X subscribers, approximately 85 million WCDMA subscribers and approximately 45 million 1xEV-DO subscribers. (1) • CDMA-based handset shipments totaled approximately 255 million units, an increase of 40% over the 182 million units shipped in fiscal 2005. (2) • CDMA-based handset shipments grew faster than total worldwide handsets and represent an estimated 28% of the total (916 million) worldwide handset shipments, compared to 25% of the total (726 million) shipments in fiscal 2005. (3) • Average selling prices of CDMA-based handsets were approximately $215, same as the prior year. (2) • We shipped approximately 207 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) integrated circuits for CDMA-based phones and data modules (all of which were 3G, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO and WCDMA), an increase of 37%, compared to approximately 151 million MSM integrated circuits in the prior fiscal year. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2006: • We estimate the ratio of WCDMA reported royalties to total reported royalties was 49%, up from 41% reported in the year ago quarter. • We estimate that, in Western Europe, WCDMA handset sales represented approximately 41% of all manufacturer handset sales during the period from April 2006 through June 2006, up from 14% in the year ago quarter. (4) (1) According to Wireless Intelligence, an independent source of wireless operator data. (2) Unit shipments and average selling prices are for the period from July through June based on reports provided during the fiscal year by our licensees/manufacturers. (3) Based on reports by Strategy Analytics, a global research and consulting firm in their Global Handset Market Share Updates. (4) Based on estimates derived from our licensee reports and estimates from the Yankee Group, a global market intelligence and advisory firm in the technology and telecommunications industry. Our Business and Operating Segments We design, manufacture, have manufactured on our behalf and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our CDMA technology and other technologies. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, from license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property, from services and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related services. Operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. 45 Table of Contents We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments. These segments are: QUALCOMM CDMA Technologies, or QCT; QUALCOMM Technology Licensing, or QTL; QUALCOMM Wireless & Internet, or QWI; and QUALCOMM Strategic Initiatives, or QSI. QCT is a leading developer and supplier of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning system products. QCT’s integrated circuit products and system software are used in wireless devices, particularly mobile phones, data cards and infrastructure equipment. The integrated circuits for wireless phones include the Mobile Station Modem (MSM), Radio Frequency (RF) and Power Management (PM) devices. These integrated circuits for wireless phones and system software perform voice and data communication, multimedia and global positioning functions, radio conversion between RF and baseband signals and power management. The infrastructure equipment integrated circuits and system software perform the core baseband CDMA modem functionality in the wireless operator’s equipment providing wireless standards-compliant processing of voice and data signals to and from wireless phones. QCT’s system software enables the other phone components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling phone manufacturers to develop handsets utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. In addition to the key components in a wireless system, QCT provides system reference designs and development tools to assist in customizing wireless phones and user interfaces, to integrate our products with components developed by others, and to test interoperability with existing and planned networks. QCT revenues comprised 58%, 58% and 64% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Integrated circuits are die, cut from silicon wafers, that have completed the assembly and final test manufacturing processes. Die, cut from silicon wafers, are the essential components of all of our integrated circuits and a significant portion of the total integrated circuit cost. We rely on independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. The majority of our integrated circuits are purchased on a turnkey basis, in which our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. We also employ a two-stage manufacturing business model in which we purchase completed die directly from semiconductor manufacturing foundries, and directly manage and contract with third party manufacturers for back-end assembly and test services. We refer to this two-stage manufacturing business model as Integrated Fabless Manufacturing (IFM). IBM, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Ltd. and United Microelectronics are the primary foundry suppliers for our family of baseband integrated circuits. Atmel, Freescale (formerly Motorola Semiconductor) and IBM are the primary foundry suppliers for our family of analog, radio frequency and power management integrated circuits. Our fabless model provides us the flexibility to select suppliers that offer advanced process technologies to manufacture, assemble and test our integrated circuits at a competitive price. QTL grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives. QTL receives revenue from license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Ongoing royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale selling price of licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g. certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.). QTL revenues comprised 35%, 32% and 27% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues has been generated primarily through our licensees’ sales of cdmaOne, CDMA2000 and WCDMA products. QWI, which includes QUALCOMM Wireless Business Solutions (QWBS), QUALCOMM Internet Services (QIS) and QUALCOMM Government Technologies (QGOV), generates revenues primarily through mobile communication products and services, software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications. QWBS provides satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging, position reporting and wireless application services to transportation companies, private fleets, construction equipment fleets and other enterprise companies. QIS provides BREW-based (Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) products that include user interface and content delivery and management products and services for the wireless industry. QIS also provides QChat and QPoint products and services. QChat enables virtually instantaneous push-to-talk functionality on CDMA-based wireless devices while QPoint enables operators to offer E-911 and location-based applications and 46 Table of Contents services. The QGOV division provides development, hardware and analytical expertise to United States government agencies involving wireless communications technologies. QWI revenues comprised 9%, 11% and 12% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. QSI manages the Company’s strategic investment activities, including MediaFLO USA, Inc. (MediaFLO USA), the Company’s wholly-owned wireless multimedia operator subsidiary. QSI also makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA-based products and services. Our strategy is to invest in CDMA-based operators, licensed device manufacturers and start-up companies that we believe open new markets for CDMA technology, support the design and introduction of new CDMA-based products or possess unique capabilities or technology. Our MediaFLO USA subsidiary expects to offer a nationwide multicasting network based on our MediaFLO MDS and FLO technology. This network is expected to be utilized as a shared resource for wireless operators and their customers in the United States. The commercial availability of the MediaFLO USA network and service will be determined by our wireless operator partners. MediaFLO USA’s network will use the 700 MHz spectrum for which we hold licenses for a nationwide footprint. Additionally, MediaFLO USA plans to procure, aggregate and distribute content in service packages which we will make available on a wholesale basis to our wireless operator customers (whether they operate on CDMA or GSM/WCDMA networks) in the United States. Distribution, marketing, billing and customer relationships are expected to remain services provided by our wireless operator partners. As part of our strategic investment activities, we may consider various corporate structuring and exit strategies at some point in the future, which may include distribution of our ownership interest in MediaFLO USA to our stockholders in a spin-off transaction. Nonreportable segments include: the QUALCOMM Wireless Systems division, which sells products that operate on the Globalstar low-Earth-orbit satellite-based telecommunications system and provides related services; the QUALCOMM MEMS Technologies division, which is developing an iMoD display technology based on micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) structure combined with thin film optics; the QUALCOMM Flarion Technologies division, which is developing OFDM/OFDMA technologies; and other product initiatives. Looking Forward The deployment of 3G networks (CDMA2000 and WCDMA) enables higher voice capacity and data rates, thereby supporting more minutes of use and data intensive applications like multimedia. As a result, we expect continued growth in demand for 3G products and services around the world: • The deployment of CDMA2000 networks is expected to continue. o More than 170 operators have launched CDMA2000 1X; (1) o More than 50 operators have deployed the higher data speeds of 1xEV-DO and several are preparing to deploy EV-DO Revision A. (1) • GSM operators are expected to continue transitioning to WCDMA networks. o More than 122 GSM operators have migrated their networks to WCDMA; (2) o More than 65 operators have launched commercial HSDPA networks and manufacturers are beginning to trial the faster uplink speeds of HSUPA. (2) • We expect WCDMA phone prices to segment into high and low end, with low-end prices decreasing significantly as volumes increase and competition intensifies among WCDMA phone manufacturers and integrated circuit suppliers, as happened with CDMA2000. We expect phone market share will change and competition will increase as WCDMA networks grow and expand beyond Japan and Western Europe into the United States and China. • To meet growing demand for advanced 3G phones and increased multimedia MSM functionality, we intend to continue to invest significant resources toward the development of multimedia products, software and services for the wireless industry. However, we expect that a portion of our research and development initiatives in fiscal 2007 will not reach commercialization until several years in the future. 47 Table of Contents • We expect demand for low-end phones to continue, and we have invested resources to develop single chip products, which integrate the baseband, radio frequency and power management chips into one package, lowering component counts and enabling faster time-to-market. While we are moving aggressively to address the low-end market more effectively with CDMA-based products, we still face significant competition from GSM-based products at the very low end, particularly in Brazil and India. • We will continue to invest in the evolution of CDMA and a broad range of other technologies as part of our vision to enable a range of technologies, each optimized for specific services, including the following products and technologies: o The BREW applications platform, content delivery services and user interfaces; o The MediaFLO Media Distribution System (MDS) and FLO technology for delivery of multimedia content; o The DO Multicarrier Multilink eXtensions (DMMX) and HSDPA Multicarrier Multilink eXtensions (HMMX) platforms to support the long-term roadmaps of 1xEV-DO and HSDPA; o OFDM and OFDMA-based technologies; o Our iMoD display technology. • We will continue to devote resources to working with and educating all participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless market. However, we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay fair royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. We expect that such companies will continue their attacks on our business model in various forums throughout the world. • In addition, our license agreement with Nokia Corp. expires in part on April 9, 2007. If we cannot conclude an extension or a new license agreement beyond that time period, Nokia’s rights to sell subscriber products under most of our patents will expire, as will our rights to sell integrated circuits under Nokia’s patents. While we continue to work with Nokia to see if we can reach an agreement, there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully resolve this matter before April 9, 2007, and little progress has been made to date. If we are unable to reach agreement, we will aggressively pursue all our legal and business remedies and assume that Nokia will do likewise. Nokia has stated publicly that it does not intend to pay us for its use of our patents prior to the resolution of the dispute. As a result, under generally accepted accounting principles, we will be unable to record royalty revenue attributable to Nokia’s sales until a court awards damages or agreement is reached, potentially resulting in a negative impact on future royalty revenues reported by our QTL segment. (1) According to public reports made available at www.cdg.org. (2) As reported by the Global mobile Suppliers Association, an international organization of WCDMA and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) suppliers in their September and October 2006 reports. Further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the Risk Factors included in this Annual Report. Revenue Concentrations Revenues from customers in South Korea, Japan, China and the United States comprised 32%, 21%, 17% and 13%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 as compared to 37%, 21%, 11% and 18%, respectively, in fiscal 2005, and 43%, 18%, 7% and 21%, respectively, in fiscal 2004. We distinguish revenue from external customers by geographic areas based on customer location. Revenues from customers in China increased as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal 2006 and in fiscal 2005, as compared to the prior years, primarily due to the maturing of CDMA-based manufacturers in China that are experiencing wider adoption of their products in international markets for low priced CDMA2000 phones and WCDMA phones. Combined revenues from customers in South Korea, Japan and the United States decreased as a percentage of total revenues, from 82% in fiscal 2004 to 76% in fiscal 2005 and 66% in fiscal 2006, primarily due to increases in the percentage of revenues from WCDMA manufacturers in Western Europe and increased activity by manufacturers in China. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets and investments, share-based payments, income taxes, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that 48 Table of Contents differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others. Revenue Recognition. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, from royalties and license fees for our intellectual property, from messaging and other services and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related services. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but it is possible that actual results may differ from our estimates. We record reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special pricing agreements and other volume-related rebate programs. Such reductions to revenue are estimates, which are based on a number of factors, including our assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes and the contractual provisions of our customer agreements. We license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD and/or the OFDMA standards and their derivatives. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee, typically five to seven years. We earn royalties on such licensed CDMA products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees’ sales occur. Our licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter, and, in some instances, although royalties are reported quarterly, payment is on a semi-annual basis. During the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the quarter in which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made. Not all royalties earned were recorded based on estimates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we determined that, due to escalating and changing business trends, we no longer had the ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from the Estimated Licensees. These escalating and changing trends included the commercial launches and global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market share among licensees due to increased global competition, and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we began recognizing royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. As of September 24, 2006, our goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $1.2 billion and $450 million, respectively. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. We assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We hold minority investments in publicly-traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile. These investments, which are recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally recorded through stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income or loss, totaled $1.3 billion at September 24, 2006. We record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination 49 Table of Contents that a decline is other-than-temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future. When assessing a publicly-traded investment for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost, the performance of the investee’s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations. We also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties. In the event our judgments change as to other-than-temporary declines in value, we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, we recorded $15 million, $12 million and $12 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary losses on our minority investments in publicly-traded companies. We hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values are difficult to determine. These investments totaled $94 million at September 24, 2006. We record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other-than-temporary. The determination that a decline is other-than-temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future. When assessing investments in private companies for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the share price from the investee’s latest financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan, the investee’s revenue and cost trends, the investee’s liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn rate, and market acceptance of the investee’s products and services. From time to time, we may consider third party evaluations, valuation reports or advice from investment banks. We also consider new products/services that the investee may have forthcoming, any significant news that has been released specific to the investee or the investee’s competitors and/or industry and the outlook of the overall industry in which the investee operates. In the event our judgments change as to other-than temporary declines in value, we may record an impairment loss which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2006 and 2005, we recorded $4 million and $1 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary losses on our investments in private companies. Such losses were not significant in fiscal 2004. Share-Based Payments. We grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our stock option plans. Eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six-month offering period under our employee stock purchase plans. The benefits provided under these plans are share-based payments subject to the provisions of revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (FAS 123R), “Share-Based Payment.” Effective September 26, 2005, we use the fair value method to apply the provisions of FAS 123R with a modified prospective application which provides for certain changes to the method for estimating the value of share-based compensation. The valuation provisions of FAS 123R apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the effective date, which are subsequently modified or cancelled. Under the modified prospective application method, prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Share-based compensation expense recognized under FAS 123R for fiscal 2006 was $495 million. At September 24, 2006, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non-vested stock options granted prior to that date was $1.2 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.7 years. Net stock options, after forfeitures and cancellations, granted during fiscal 2006 represented 1.9% of outstanding shares as of the beginning of the fiscal period. Total stock options granted during fiscal 2006 represented 2.1% of outstanding shares as of the end of the fiscal period. Upon adoption of FAS 123R, we began estimating the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a lattice binomial option-pricing model (binomial model). Prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, the value of all share-based awards was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (Black-Scholes model) for the pro forma information required to be disclosed under FAS 123. The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. 50 Table of Contents If factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of FAS 123R in future periods, the compensation expense that we record under FAS 123R may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period. Therefore, we believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option-pricing models to estimate share-based compensation under FAS 123R. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions, are fully transferable and do not cause dilution. Because our share-based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values, in our opinion, existing valuation models, including the Black-Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share-based compensation awards. Consequently, there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share-based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise, expiration, early termination or forfeiture of those share-based payments in the future. Certain share-based payments, such as employee stock options, may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements. Alternatively, value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements. There is not currently a market-based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models, nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values. Although the fair value of employee share-based awards is determined in accordance with FAS 123R and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107), using an option-pricing model, that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction. Estimates of share-based compensation expenses are significant to our consolidated financial statements, but these expenses are based on option valuation models and will never result in the payment of cash by us. For this reason, and because we do not view share-based compensation as related to our operational performance, we exclude estimated share-based compensation expense when evaluating the business performance of our operating segments. The guidance in FAS 123R and SAB 107 is relatively new, and best practices are not well established. The application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time. There are significant differences among valuation models, and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future. This may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of share-based payments. It may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models, methods and assumptions. Theoretical valuation models and market-based methods are evolving and may result in lower or higher fair value estimates for share-based compensation. The timing, readiness, adoption, general acceptance, reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain. Sophisticated mathematical models may require voluminous historical information, modeling expertise, financial analyses, correlation analyses, integrated software and databases, consulting fees, customization and testing for adequacy of internal controls. Market-based methods are emerging that, if employed by us, may dilute our earnings per share and involve significant transaction fees and ongoing administrative expenses. The uncertainties and costs of these extensive valuation efforts may outweigh the benefits to investors. For purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2006 using the binomial model, we used the implied volatility of market-traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the binomial model, consistent with the guidance in FAS 123R and SAB 107. We utilized the term structure of volatility up to approximately two years, and the implied volatility of the option with the longest time to maturity was used for the expected volatility estimates for periods beyond two years. The weighted-average volatility assumption was 30.7% for fiscal 2006, which if increased to 37%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2006 by $1.66 per share, or 11%. The volatility percentage assumed for fiscal 2006 was based on the implied volatility of traded options, as compared to the blend of implied and historical volatility data used in prior years. FAS 123R includes implied volatility in its list of factors that should be considered in estimating expected volatility. We believe implied volatility is more useful than historical volatility in estimating expected volatility because it is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury strip securities for a period consistent with the contractual life of the option in effect at the time of grant. The weighted-average risk-free interest rate 51 Table of Contents assumption was 4.6% for fiscal 2006, which if increased to 6.5%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2006 by $1.19 per share, or 8%. We do not target a specific dividend yield for our dividend payments, but we are required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the binomial model. The dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts. The dividend yield assumption was 1.0% for fiscal 2006, which if decreased to 0.4%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2006 by $0.89 per share, or 6%. Dividends and/or increases or decreases in dividend payments are subject to board approval as well as to future cash inflows and outflows resulting from operating performance, stock repurchase programs, mergers and acquisitions, and other sources and uses of cash. While our historical dividend rate is assumed to continue in the future, it may be subject to substantial change, and investors should not depend upon this forecast as a reliable indication of future cash distributions that will be made to investors. The post-vesting forfeiture rate is estimated using historical option cancellation information. The weighted-average post-vesting forfeiture rate assumption was 6.0% for fiscal 2006, which if decreased to 1.5%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2006 by $0.88 per share, or 6%. The suboptimal exercise factor is estimated using historical option exercise information. The weighted-average suboptimal exercise factor assumption was 1.7 for fiscal 2006, which if increased to 2.0, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2006 by $1.06 per share, or 7%. Income Taxes. Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. As part of our assessment of potential adjustments to our tax returns, we increase our current tax liability to the extent an adjustment would result in a cash tax payment or decrease our deferred tax assets to the extent an adjustment would not result in a cash tax payment. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. As of September 24, 2006, gross deferred tax assets were $914 million. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results. As of September 24, 2006, we had gross deferred tax assets of $267 million related to capital loss carryforwards. We can only use capital losses to offset capital gains. Based upon our assessments of projected future capital gains and losses and related tax planning strategies, we expect that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all the capital losses that we have incurred through fiscal 2006. Therefore, we have provided a $16 million valuation allowance for the portion of capital losses we do not expect to utilize. Significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future capital gains and the timing of realization of capital losses. Adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses and capital gains are reflected in the period the change is made. We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. No provision has been made for United States federal and state, or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of which is approximately $2.7 billion as of September 24, 2006. Should we repatriate foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is made. 52 Table of Contents Beginning September 26, 2005, we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders’ equity only when realized. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from September 26, 2005 onward. A windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee’s disposition of a share-based award exceeds the deferred tax asset, if any, associated with the award that we had recorded. When assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share-based compensation has been realized, we follow the tax law ordering method, under which current year share-based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. Litigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions. We estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. We have not recorded any accrual for contingent liability associated with our legal proceedings based on our belief that a liability, while possible, is not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations. Acquisitions On January 18, 2006, we completed our acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Flarion Technologies, Inc. (Flarion), a privately held developer of Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA) technology for approximately $613 million in consideration, consisting of approximately $349 million in shares of QUALCOMM stock, $229 million in cash, and the exchange of Flarion’s existing vested options and warrants with an estimated aggregate fair value of approximately $35 million. In addition, we assumed Flarion’s existing unvested options with an estimated aggregate fair value of $63 million, which is recorded as share-based compensation over the requisite service period pursuant to FAS 123R. Upon achievement of certain agreed upon milestones during the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we incurred additional aggregate consideration of $197 million, consisting of approximately $185 million in cash (of which $75 million will be payable in July 2007), $8 million in shares of QUALCOMM stock (of which $3 million is issuable in March 2007), and the modification of Flarion’s existing vested options and warrants with an estimated incremental fair value of approximately $4 million. The additional amounts payable in cash and shares on the milestone date were treated as additional consideration and recorded as goodwill. In addition, the modification of Flarion’s existing unvested options resulted in an estimated incremental fair value of $7 million, which will be recorded as share-based compensation over the requisite service period pursuant to FAS 123R. The acquisition of Flarion is intended to broaden our ability to effectively support operators who may prefer an OFDMA or a hybrid OFDM/CDMA/WCDMA network alternative. The addition of Flarion’s intellectual property and engineering resources also supplements the resources that we have already dedicated over the years towards the development of OFDM/OFDMA technologies. Strategic Investments in Our QSI Segment Our QSI segment makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and services. QSI segment assets totaled $660 million at September 24, 2006, compared to $442 million at September 25, 2005. Our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, a wireless multimedia operator, is expected to begin commercial operations in 2007. QSI’s assets related to MediaFLO USA totaled $329 million and $98 million at September 24, 2006 and September 25, 2005, respectively. We also enter into strategic relationships with CDMA wireless operators and developers of innovative technologies or products for the wireless communications industry. Due to financial and competitive challenges facing wireless operators, we cannot assure you that our investments in or loans to these operators will generate financial returns or that they will result in increased adoption or continued use of CDMA technologies. CDMA wireless operators to whom we have provided funding have limited operating histories, are faced with significant capital requirements and are highly leveraged and/or have limited financial resources. If these CDMA wireless operators are not successful, we may have to write down our investments in or loans to these operators. Our QSI segment maintains strategic investments in marketable equity securities classified as available-for-sale. We strategically invest in companies in the high-technology industry and typically do not attempt to reduce or 53 Table of Contents eliminate our exposure to market risks in these investments. The fair values of these strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market price volatility. Our strategic investments in specific companies and industry segments may vary over time, and changes in concentrations may affect price volatility. Downward fluctuations and market trends could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the realizable value of these securities and derivative instruments is subject to market and other conditions. QSI also makes strategic investments in privately held companies, including early-stage companies and venture funds. These investments are comprised of equity investments, recorded at cost or under the equity method, and warrants that are recorded at fair value or at cost. The recorded values of these investments may be written down due to changes in the companies’ conditions or prospects. These strategic investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products the investees are developing may never materialize. As a result, we could lose all or a portion of our investments in these companies, which could negatively affect our financial position and operating results. Most of these strategic investments will not become liquid until more than one year from the date of investment, if at all. To the extent such investments become liquid and meet strategic and price objectives, we may sell the investments and recognize the realized gain (loss) in investment income (expense). We regularly monitor and evaluate the realizable value of our investments in both marketable and private securities. If events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the value of these assets has occurred and is other-than-temporary, we will record a charge to investment income (expense). In some cases, we make strategic investments that require us to consolidate or record our equity in the losses of early-stage companies. The consolidation of these losses can adversely affect our financial results until we exit from or reduce our exposure to the investments. Key developments in our strategic investments during fiscal 2006 included our ongoing investment in our MediaFLO USA subsidiary, a slow down in the rate of strategic investment, including our investment in Inquam, and realized gains on certain strategic investments. Investment in Inquam Limited. We and another investor (the Other Investor) own minority interests in Inquam Limited (Inquam), a wireless CDMA-based operator in Romania, and in Inquam’s former subsidiaries in Portugal (the Portugal Companies). We recorded $20 million, $33 million and $59 million in equity in losses of Inquam during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, including a $12 million loss resulting from Inquam’s restructuring during fiscal 2006. At September 24, 2006, our equity and debt investments in Inquam and the Portugal Companies totaled $5 million, net of equity in losses. We and the Other Investor have each guaranteed 50% of a portion of amounts owed under certain of Inquam’s long-term financing arrangements, up to a combined maximum of $53 million. The guarantee expires and the facilities mature on December 25, 2011. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2006 were $7.53 billion, compared to $5.67 billion for fiscal 2005. Revenues from three customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI segments comprised an aggregate of 39% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2005. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2006 were $4.78 billion, compared to $3.74 billion for fiscal 2005. Revenues from sales of integrated circuits increased $1.00 billion, resulting primarily from an increase of $1.34 billion related primarily to higher unit shipments of MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, partially offset by a decrease of $349 million related to the net effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2006 were $2.75 billion, compared to $1.93 billion for fiscal 2005. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees increased primarily as a result of a $774 million increase in royalty revenue, consisting primarily of royalties reported to QTL by our external licensees, resulting from an increase in sales of CDMA-based products by licensees and the impact of the expiration of one of our royalty sharing obligations. Worldwide demand for CDMA-based products has increased primarily as a result of the growth in sales of WCDMA products into markets formerly dominated by GSM products. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2006 was $2.18 billion, compared to $1.65 billion for fiscal 2005. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 46% for fiscal 2006, compared to 44% for fiscal 2005. The decline in margin percentage in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the effect of $41 million in share-based compensation during fiscal 2006 as a result of the adoption of FAS123R during fiscal 2006 and a decrease in QCT margin 54 Table of Contents percentage resulting primarily from an increase in product support costs. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues may fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold and services provided, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2006, research and development expenses were $1.54 billion or 20% of revenues, compared to $1.01 billion or 18% of revenues for fiscal 2005. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2006 included share-based compensation of $216 million as a result of the adoption of FAS 123R during fiscal 2006 and in-process research and development of $22 million resulting from acquisitions, both of which caused the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues. The dollar increase in research and development expenses also included a $272 million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support lower cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO Revision B, WCDMA (including GSM/GPRS/EDGE), HSDPA, HSUPA and OFDMA, and the development of our FLO technology, MediaFLO MDS and iMoD display products using MEMS technology. We expect that research and development costs will increase in fiscal 2007 as we continue our active support of CDMA-based technologies, products and network operations and other product initiatives. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2006, selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.12 billion or 15% of revenues, compared to $631 million or 11% of revenues for fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2006 included share-based compensation of $238 million as a result of the adoption of FAS 123R during fiscal 2006. The percentage increase was primarily attributable to the share-based compensation. The dollar increase was also attributable to a $107 million increase in professional fees, primarily related to legal activities, a $90 million increase in employee-related expenses, a $14 million increase in selling and marketing expenses and a $14 million decrease in other income. Net Investment Income. Net investment income was $466 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $423 million for fiscal 2005. The change was primarily comprised as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 24, 2006 September 25, 2005 Change Interest and dividend income: QSI $ 6 $ 4 $ 2 Corporate and other segments 410 252 158 Interest expense (4 ) (3 ) (1 ) Net realized gains on investments: QSI 30 101 (71 ) Corporate 106 78 28 Other-than-temporary losses on investments (24 ) (14 ) (10 ) (Losses) gains on derivative instruments (29 ) 33 (62 ) Equity in losses of investees (29 ) (28 ) (1 ) $ 466 $ 423 $ 43 The increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates earned on interest-bearing securities. Net realized gains on QSI investments in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from a $48 million gain on our minority investment in a wireless publisher and a $41 million gain on the sale of our investment in a wireless telecommunications company. Losses and gains on derivative instruments in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, related primarily to changes in the fair values of put options sold in connection with our stock repurchase program. The change in equity in losses of investees resulted primarily from the decrease in losses recognized by Inquam, of which our share was $20 million and $33 million in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, partially offset by the effect of investment gains recognized by a venture fund investee in 2005, of which our share was $8 million. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $686 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $666 million for fiscal 2005. The annual effective tax rate for continuing operations was approximately 22% for fiscal 2006, compared to 24% for fiscal 2005. The annual effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 was lower than the annual effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate. 55 Table of Contents The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was 13% lower than the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 17% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, 1% related to an increase in tax benefits resulting from our increased ability to use our capital loss carryforwards and 1% related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by state taxes of approximately 5% and other permanent differences of 1%. As of September 24, 2006, we had a valuation allowance of $16 million on previously incurred capital losses due to uncertainty as to our ability to generate sufficient capital gains to utilize all capital losses. We will continue to assess the realizability of capital losses. The amount of the valuation allowance on capital losses may be adjusted in the future as our ability to utilize capital losses changes. A change in the valuation allowance may impact the provision for income taxes in the period the change occurs. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2005 were $5.67 billion, compared to $4.88 billion for fiscal 2004. Revenues from three customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI segments comprised an aggregate of 39% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2005, compared to 40% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2004. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2005 were $3.74 billion, compared to $3.51 billion for fiscal 2004. Revenues from sales of integrated circuits increased $165 million, resulting primarily from an increase of $396 million related to higher unit shipments of MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, partially offset by a decrease of $241 million related to the effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Revenues from the sale of satellite and terrestrial-based two-way data messaging systems and related messaging services increased $25 million and revenues from the sale of satellite portable phones that operate on the Globalstar low-Earth-orbit satellite communications system increased $19 million. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2005 were $1.93 billion, compared to $1.37 billion for fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, the QTL segment recorded royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the year, as compared to the method used during the first three quarters of fiscal 2004 of recording royalty revenues from certain licensees based on estimates of royalty revenues earned by those licensees during the quarter. The increase in royalty revenue year to year resulted primarily from a $350 million increase in royalties reported to us by our external licensees and the effect of changing the timing of recognizing royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalty revenues recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151 million of royalties that were reported by external licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to us by external licensees in fiscal 2005 were $1.64 billion, as compared to $1.29 billion in fiscal 2004. The increase in royalties reported to us by external licensees was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA products by licensees, resulting from higher worldwide demand for CDMA products at higher average selling prices due primarily to the growth in sales of high-end WCDMA products and shifts in the geographic distribution of sales of CDMA products. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2005 was $1.65 billion, compared to $1.48 billion for fiscal 2004. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 44% for fiscal 2005, compared to 42% for fiscal 2004. The margin percentage decline in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily due to a 1.3% decrease in QCT margin percentage. Increases in product support costs and the reserves for excess and obsolete inventory contributed 1.1% and 0.5%, respectively, to the total decrease in QCT margin percentage. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2005, research and development expenses were $1.01 billion or 18% of revenues, compared to $720 million or 15% of revenues for fiscal 2004. The dollar and percentage increases in research and development expenses primarily resulted from a $275 million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support lower cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA, GSM/GPRS/EDGE and OFDMA, and the development of our FLO technology, MediaFLO MDS and iMoD display products using MEMS technology. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses were $631 million or 11% of revenues, compared to $547 million or 11% of revenues for fiscal 2004. The dollar increase was primarily due to a $38 million increase in professional fees, primarily patent administration and outside consultants, a $33 million increase in employee-related expenses, and a $13 million decrease in other income. 56 Table of Contents Net Investment Income. Net investment income was $423 million for fiscal 2005, compared to $184 million for fiscal 2004. The change was primarily comprised as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 25, 2005 September 26, 2004 Change Interest and dividend income: QSI $ 4 $ 14 $ (10 ) Corporate and other segments 252 161 91 Interest expense (3 ) (2 ) (1 ) Net realized gains on investments: QSI 101 56 45 Corporate 78 32 46 Other-than-temporary losses on investments (14 ) (12 ) (2 ) Gains on derivative instruments 33 7 26 Equity in losses of investees (28 ) (72 ) 44 $ 423 $ 184 $ 239 The increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates earned on interest-bearing securities. Net realized gains on corporate investments increased primarily as a result of an increase in the positive performance of marketable equity securities as a percentage of total corporate investments in fiscal 2005, as compared to fiscal 2004. The increase in net realized gains on strategic investments in QSI resulted primarily from a $48 million gain on our minority investment in a wireless publisher and a $41 million gain on the sale of our investment in a wireless telecommunications company. Gains on derivative instruments in fiscal 2005 and 2004 related primarily to changes in the fair values of put options sold in connection with our stock repurchase program. Equity in losses of investees decreased primarily due to a decrease in losses incurred by Inquam, of which our share was $33 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to $59 million for fiscal 2004. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense from continuing operations was $666 million for fiscal 2005, compared to $588 million for fiscal 2004. The annual effective tax rate for continuing operations was approximately 24% for fiscal 2005, compared to 25% for fiscal 2004. The annual effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 was lower than the annual effective tax rate from continuing operations for fiscal 2004 primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 was 11% lower than the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 10% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, 3% related to an increase in tax benefits resulting from our increased ability to use our capital loss carryforwards and 2% related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by state taxes of approximately 4%. As of September 25, 2005, we had a valuation allowance of approximately $62 million on previously incurred capital losses due to uncertainty as to our ability to generate sufficient capital gains to utilize all capital losses. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results of fiscal 2006 and 2005 for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10 – Segment Information.” QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2006 were $4.33 billion, compared to $3.29 billion for fiscal 2005. Equipment and services revenues, primarily from MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, were $4.20 billion for fiscal 2006, compared to $3.20 billion for fiscal 2005. The increase in equipment and services revenue was primarily comprised of an increase of $1.34 billion related to higher unit shipments, partially offset by a decrease of $349 million related to the effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Approximately 207 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2006, compared to approximately 151 million for fiscal 2005. QCT’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2006 were $1.13 billion, compared to $852 million for fiscal 2005. QCT’s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage) was 26% during both fiscal 2006 and 2005. The operating margin percentage remained consistent as the gross margin percentage decrease, resulting 57 Table of Contents primarily from an increase in product support costs, was offset by a decrease in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of QCT revenue. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2006 were $2.63 billion, compared to $1.84 billion for fiscal 2005. QTL’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2006 were $2.40 billion, compared to $1.66 billion for fiscal 2005. QTL’s operating margin percentage was 91% in fiscal 2006 as compared to 90% in fiscal 2005. The increase in both revenues and earnings before taxes primarily resulted from a $774 million increase in royalties reported to us by our licensees which were $2.42 billion in fiscal 2006, compared to $1.64 billion in fiscal 2005. The increase in royalty revenue relates to the increase in sales of CDMA-based products by licensees and the impact of the expiration of one of our royalty sharing obligations. Revenues from amortized license fees were $50 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $69 million in fiscal 2005. Other revenues were comprised of intersegment royalties. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2006 were $670 million, compared to $644 million for fiscal 2005. Revenues increased primarily due to a $41 million increase in QIS revenue, partially offset by a decrease in QWBS revenue of $12 million. The increase in QIS revenue was primarily attributable to a $28 million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products and a $17 million increase in QChat revenue resulting from increased development efforts under the licensing agreement with Sprint. The decrease in QWBS revenue was primarily attributable to a $26 million decrease in equipment revenue, which includes a $19 million decrease in amortization of deferred revenues related to historical equipment sales, partially offset by a $14 million increase in messaging services revenue. QWBS shipped approximately 42,100 satellite-based systems and 39,600 terrestrial-based systems during fiscal 2006, compared to approximately 46,800 satellite-based systems and 62,500 terrestrial-based systems in fiscal 2005. QWI’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2006 were $80 million, compared to $57 million for fiscal 2005. QWI’s operating margin percentage was 12% in fiscal 2006, compared to 9% in fiscal 2005. The increase in QWI earnings before taxes was primarily due to a $39 million increase in QIS gross margin largely resulting from the increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products and QChat development efforts, partially offset by the effect of a $13 million increase in QWI research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in QWI’s operating margin percentage was primarily due to the increase in QIS gross margin. QSI Segment. QSI’s losses before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal 2006 were $133 million, compared to earnings before taxes from continuing operations of $10 million for fiscal 2005. QSI’s losses before taxes from continuing operations included a $55 million increase in our MediaFLO USA subsidiary’s operating expenses. During fiscal 2006, QSI recorded $30 million in realized gains on marketable securities and other investments, compared to $101 million in fiscal 2005. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results of fiscal 2005 and 2004 for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10 – Segment Information.” QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2005 were $3.29 billion, compared to $3.11 billion for fiscal 2004. Equipment and services revenues, primarily from MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, were $3.20 billion for fiscal 2005, compared to $3.04 billion for fiscal 2004. The increase in equipment and services revenue was comprised of $396 million related to higher unit shipments, partially offset by a decrease of $241 million related to the effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Approximately 151 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2005, compared to approximately 137 million for fiscal 2004. QCT’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2005 were $852 million, compared to $1.05 billion for fiscal 2004. QCT’s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage) was 26% in fiscal 2005, compared to 34% in fiscal 2004. The decline in operating margin percentage in fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004 was primarily the result of a 45% increase in research and development expenses for fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004, mainly related to increased investment in new integrated circuit products and technology research and development initiatives to support lower cost phones, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless Internet access and multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSDPA and GSM/GPRS/EDGE. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2005 were $1.84 billion, compared to $1.33 billion for fiscal 2004. QTL’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2005 were $1.66 billion, compared to $1.20 billion for fiscal 2004. QTL’s operating margin percentage was 90% during both fiscal 2005 and 2004. The increase in both revenues and earnings 58 Table of Contents before taxes primarily resulted from a $350 million increase in royalties reported to us by our external licensees and the effect of changing the timing of recognizing royalty revenues in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Royalty revenues recorded in fiscal 2004 excluded $151 million of royalties that were reported by external licensees in the first quarter of fiscal 2004, but estimated and recorded as revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Royalties reported to us by external licensees in fiscal 2005 were $1.64 billion, compared to $1.29 billion in fiscal 2004. The increase in royalties reported to us by external licensees was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA products by licensees, resulting from higher worldwide demand for CDMA products at higher average selling prices due primarily to the growth of higher priced WCDMA sales and shifts in the geographic distribution of sales of CDMA products. Revenues from amortized license fees were $69 million in fiscal 2005, as compared to $59 million in fiscal 2004. Other revenues were comprised of intersegment royalties. During the periods preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we estimated and recorded the royalty revenues earned for sales by certain licensees (the Estimated Licensees) in the quarter in which such sales occurred, but only when reasonable estimates of such amounts could be made. Not all royalties earned were recorded based on estimates. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we determined that, due to escalating and changing business trends, we no longer had the ability to reliably estimate royalty revenues from the Estimated Licensees. These escalating and changing trends included the commercial launches and global expansion of WCDMA networks, changes in market share among licensees due to increased global competition, and increased variability in the integrated circuit and finished product inventories of licensees. Starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, we began recognizing royalty revenues solely based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter. The change in the timing of recognizing royalty revenue was made prospectively and had the initial one-time effect of reducing royalty revenues recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. Accordingly, we did not estimate royalty revenues earned in fiscal 2005. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2005 were $644 million, compared to $571 million for fiscal 2004. Revenues increased primarily due to a $37 million increase in QIS revenue and a $27 million increase in QWBS revenue. The increase in QIS revenue was primarily attributable to a $41 million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products. The increase in QWBS revenue was primarily attributable to a $16 million increase in equipment revenue, net of a $24 million decrease in amortization of deferred revenues related to historical equipment sales, and a $10 million increase in related messaging services revenue. QWBS shipped approximately 46,800 satellite-based systems and 62,500 terrestrial-based systems during fiscal 2005, compared to approximately 43,400 satellite-based systems and 10,000 terrestrial-based systems in fiscal 2004. QWI’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2005 were $57 million, compared to $19 million for fiscal 2004. QWI’s operating margin percentage was 9% in fiscal 2005, compared to 3% in fiscal 2004. The increases in QWI earnings before taxes and operating margin percentage were primarily due to a $39 million increase in QIS gross margin largely resulting from the increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products. During fiscal 2005, QWBS completed the process of moving high-volume, standard product manufacturing to Mexico to reduce manufacturing costs. The low-volume, prototype and new product manufacturing activities remain in San Diego. QSI Segment. QSI’s earnings before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 were $10 million, compared to losses before taxes from continuing operations of $31 million for fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2005, QSI recorded $101 million in realized gains on marketable securities and other investments, compared to $56 million in fiscal 2004. Equity in losses of investees decreased by $43 million primarily due to a decrease in losses incurred by Inquam during fiscal 2005 as compared to fiscal 2004, of which our share was $33 million for fiscal 2005 as compared to $59 million for fiscal 2004. QSI’s earnings before taxes from continuing operations also included a $42 million increase in MediaFLO USA operating expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $9.9 billion at September 24, 2006, an increase of $1.3 billion from September 25, 2005. Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 24, 2006 consisted of $3.8 billion held by foreign subsidiaries with the remaining balance of $6.1 billion held domestically. Due to income tax considerations, we derive liquidity for operations primarily from investments held domestically. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.3 billion during fiscal 2006, compared to $2.7 billion during fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily attributable to higher net income (net of non-cash share-based 59 Table of Contents compensation expense) in fiscal 2006. Net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans was $692 million during fiscal 2006, compared to $386 million during fiscal 2005. On November 7, 2005, we authorized the repurchase of up to $2.5 billion of our common stock under a stock repurchase program with no expiration date. During fiscal 2006, we repurchased and retired 34,000,000 shares of common stock for $1.5 billion. At September 24, 2006, approximately $0.9 billion remained authorized for repurchases under our stock repurchase program, net of put options outstanding. We will continue to actively evaluate repurchases under this program. We declared and paid dividends totaling $698 million, $524 million and $307 million, or $0.42, $0.32 and $0.19 per share, during fiscal 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. On October 5, 2006, we announced a cash dividend of $0.12 per share on our common stock, payable on January 4, 2007 to stockholders of record as of December 7, 2006. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. Accounts receivable increased by 29% during fiscal 2006. Days sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, were 29 days at September 24, 2006, compared to 30 days at September 25, 2005. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increase in revenue in fiscal 2006 as compared to fiscal 2005 and the timing of cash receipts for royalty receivables. The change in days sales outstanding is consistent with the increases in revenue and accounts receivable. On January 18, 2006, we completed our acquisition of Flarion, a developer of OFDMA technology, for approximately $613 million in consideration, including approximately $229 million in cash. Upon achievement of certain agreed upon milestones during the third quarter of fiscal 2006, we incurred additional aggregate consideration of $197 million, including approximately $185 million in cash (of which $75 million will be payable in July 2007). We intend to continue our strategic investment activities to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA products and the growth of CDMA-based wireless data and wireless Internet products. As part of these investment activities, we may provide financing or other support to facilitate the marketing and sale of CDMA equipment by authorized suppliers. In the event additional needs for cash arise, we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including potential debt and equity issuance. We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected working and other capital requirements for the foreseeable future based on current business plans, including acquisitions, investments in other companies and other assets to support the growth of our business, financing and other commitments, the payment of dividends and possible additional stock repurchases. Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in S-K 303(a)(4)(ii). At September 24, 2006, our outstanding contractual obligations included (in millions): Contractual Obligations Payments Due By Period No Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Beyond Expiration Total 2007 2008-2009 2010-2011 Fiscal 2011 Date Purchase obligations (1) $ 829 $ 663 $ 110 $ 38 $ 18 $ — Operating leases 291 71 74 49 97 — Other commitments (2) 42 — — — 26 16 Total commitments 1,162 734 184 87 141 16 Capital leases (3) 125 3 6 8 108 — Other long-term liabilities (4) 47 — 45 — 2 — Total recorded liabilities 172 3 51 8 110 — Total $ 1,334 $ 737 $ 235 $ 95 $ 251 $ 16 (1) Total purchase obligations include $593 million in commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories. 60 Table of Contents (2) Certain of these commitments do not have fixed funding dates. Amounts are presented based on the expiration of the commitment, but actual funding may occur earlier or not at all as funding is subject to certain conditions. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed or funded under these arrangements; actual financing or funding may be in lesser amounts. (3) Amounts represent future minimum lease payments including interest payments. Capital lease obligations are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at September 24, 2006. (4) Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenue, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 24, 2006 is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4 – Investments in Other Entities and Note 9 – Commitments and Contingencies.” Future Accounting Requirements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on the derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. The accounting provisions of FIN 48 will be effective for us beginning October 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of initially adopting FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption and will be presented separately. Only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. We are in the process of determining the effect, if any, the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. We invest our cash in a number of diversified investment and non-investment grade fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Changes in the general level of United States interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed income investments. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed income investments could lose value. If the general economy were to weaken significantly, the credit profile of issuers of securities held in our investment portfolios could deteriorate, and our investments could lose value. We may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs that do not perform well. The following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For our interest-bearing securities, the table presents principal cash flows, weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes. 61 Table of Contents Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal Amount by Expected Maturity Average Interest Rates (Dollars in millions) No Single Fair 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Maturity Total Value Fixed interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 482 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 482 $ 482 Interest rate 5.3 % Available-for-sale securities: Investment grade $ 2,138 $ 436 $ 238 $ 39 $ 12 $ 10 $ 267 $ 3,140 $ 3,140 Interest rate 4.1 % 4.6 % 5.2 % 5.0 % 5.2 % 7.3 % 4.9 % Non-investment grade $ 2 $ 13 $ 37 $ 30 $ 61 $ 352 $ — $ 495 $ 495 Interest rate 7.2 % 5.8 % 6.8 % 7.7 % 7.5 % 8.0 % Floating interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 999 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 999 $ 999 Interest rate 5.3 % Available-for-sale securities: Investment grade $ 157 $ 116 $ 192 $ 52 $ 3 $ 87 $ 348 $ 955 $ 955 Interest rate 5.0 % 5.3 % 5.6 % 5.6 % 5.8 % 5.8 % 5.5 % Non-investment grade $ 10 $ 14 $ 12 $ 26 $ 65 $ 258 $ 512 $ 897 $ 897 Interest rate 6.4 % 6.7 % 6.6 % 6.5 % 7.1 % 7.1 % 7.2 % Equity Price Risk. We invest in a number of diversified marketable securities and mutual fund shares subject to equity price risk. The recorded values of marketable equity securities increased to $1.34 billion at September 24, 2006 from $1.16 billion at September 25, 2005. The recorded value of equity mutual fund shares increased to $1.52 billion at September 24, 2006 from $293 million at September 25, 2005. Our diversified investments in companies and industry segments may vary over time, and changes in the concentrations of these investments may affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund shares at September 24, 2006 would cause a corresponding 10% decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities, or $285 million. Our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of investments in private early-stage companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods. Accordingly, we believe that our exposure to market risk from these investments is not material. Additionally, we do not anticipate any near-term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management’s objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures. The recorded values of these strategic investments totaled $93 million at September 24, 2006, compared to $121 million at September 25, 2005. In connection with our stock repurchase program, we sell put options that may require us to repurchase shares of our common stock at fixed prices. These written put options subject us to equity price risk. At September 24, 2006, we had two outstanding put options, enabling holders to purchase 2,000,000 shares of our common stock upon exercise for approximately $89 million (net of the option premiums received). The put option liabilities, with a fair value of $19 million at September 24, 2006, were included in other current liabilities. If the fair value of our common stock at September 24, 2006 decreased by 10%, the amount required to physically settle the put options would exceed the fair value of the shares by $21 million, net of the $6 million in premiums received. Additional information regarding our strategic investments is provided in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report. Foreign Exchange Risk. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, consisting primarily of foreign currency forward and option contracts. Such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. At September 24, 2006, we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. At September 24, 2006, the net recorded value of our foreign currency option contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of CDMA and WCDMA products was a liability of $2 million. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates 62 Table of Contents were to change unfavorably by 20% in each of our hedged foreign currencies, we would incur a loss of approximately $3 million resulting from a decrease in fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 – The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies. Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries and equity method investees which are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies. Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks.",2023-12-30 18:21:51.727357
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Recent Developments Revenues for fiscal 2007 were $8.87 billion, with net income of $3.30 billion. The following recent developments occurred with respect to key elements of our business or our industry during fiscal 2007: • Worldwide wireless subscribers grew by more than 21% to reach approximately 3.1 billion.(1) • CDMA subscribers, including both 2G (cdmaOne) and 3G (CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO and WCDMA), grew to approximately 17% of total worldwide wireless subscribers to date. (1) • 3G subscribers (all CDMA-based) grew to approximately 530 million worldwide by September 30, 2007, including approximately 370 million CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO subscribers and approximately 160 million WCDMA/HSPA subscribers. (1) • CDMA-based handset shipments totaled approximately 338 million units, an increase of 34% over the 253 million units shipped in fiscal 2006. (2) (4) • CDMA-based handset shipments grew faster than total worldwide handsets and represent an estimated 32% of the total (1.1 billion) worldwide handset shipments, compared to 28% of the total (911 million) shipments in fiscal 2006. (3) • The average selling price of CDMA-based handsets was estimated to be approximately $214, same as the prior year. (2) (4) • We shipped approximately 253 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) integrated circuits for CDMA-based wireless devices and data modules, an increase of 22%, compared to approximately 207 million MSM integrated circuits in fiscal 2006. • We are engaged in multiple disputes with Nokia Corp., including arbitration over Nokia’s obligation to pay royalties for the use of certain of our patents. As a result, under generally accepted accounting principles, we are not recording royalty revenue attributable to Nokia’s sales after April 9, 2007 until an arbitrator (or court) awards damages or the disputes are otherwise resolved by agreement with Nokia, resulting in a negative impact on royalty revenues reported by our QTL segment. We expect activity in this area to remain high and anticipate some decisions and/or rulings in 2008. (1) According to Wireless Intelligence, an independent source of wireless operator data. (2) Fiscal 2007 information was derived from reports provided by our licensees/manufacturers during the year and our own estimates of unreported activity. Fiscal 2006 information was derived from reports provided by our licensees/manufacturers during the year. (3) Based on current reports by Strategy Analytics, a global research and consulting firm, in their Global Handset Market Share Updates. (4) We perform periodic audits of the royalties payable by our licensees. As a result of our audit process, we determined during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007 that total CDMA-based handset unit shipments and average selling prices (ASPs) should be adjusted for certain periods. The adjustments related only to handset shipments and ASPs and did not impact the amount or timing of our revenue. Our Business and Operating Segments We design, manufacture, have manufactured on our behalf and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our CDMA technology and other technologies. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, from license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property, from services and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related services. Operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. 43 Table of Contents We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments. These segments are: Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, or QCT; Qualcomm Technology Licensing, or QTL; Qualcomm Wireless & Internet, or QWI; and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives, or QSI. QCT is a leading developer and supplier of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning system products. QCT’s integrated circuit products and system software are used in wireless devices, particularly mobile phones, data cards and infrastructure equipment. The integrated circuits for wireless devices include the MSM, RF and PM devices. These integrated circuits for wireless devices and system software perform voice and data communication, multimedia and global positioning functions, radio conversion between RF and baseband signals and power management. QCT’s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling phone manufacturers to develop handsets utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. The infrastructure equipment integrated circuits and system software perform the core baseband CDMA modem functionality in the wireless operator’s base station equipment. In addition to the key components in a wireless system, QCT provides system reference designs and development tools to assist in customizing wireless devices and user interfaces, to integrate our products with components developed by others, and to test interoperability with existing and planned networks. QCT revenues comprised 59%, 58% and 58% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. We rely on independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing business models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing business model, we purchase completed die directly from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract directly with third party manufacturers for back-end assembly and test services. We refer to this two-stage manufacturing business model as Integrated Fabless Manufacturing (IFM). QTL grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD, GPRS/EDGE and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives. QTL receives revenue from license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Ongoing royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale selling price of licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g. certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.). QTL revenues comprised 31%, 33% and 30% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues have been generated primarily through our licensees’ sales of cdmaOne, CDMA2000 and WCDMA products. QWI, which includes Qualcomm Enterprise Services (QES) (formerly Qualcomm Wireless Business Solutions, or QWBS), Qualcomm Internet Services (QIS) and Qualcomm Government Technologies (QGOV), generates revenues primarily through mobile communication products and services, software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications. QES sells equipment, software and services used by transportation and other companies to connect wirelessly with their assets, products and workforce. QES also sells products that operate on the Globalstar low-Earth-orbit satellite-based telecommunications system and provides related services. Through September 2007, QES has shipped approximately 1,192,000 terrestrial-based and satellite-based communications systems. QIS provides BREW-based (Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) products that include user interface and content delivery and management products and services for the wireless industry. QIS also provides QChat, which enables virtually instantaneous push-to-talk functionality on CDMA-based wireless devices. The QGOV division provides development, hardware and analytical expertise involving wireless communications technologies to United States government agencies. QWI revenues comprised 9%, 10% and 12% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. QSI manages the Company’s strategic investment activities, including MediaFLO USA, Inc. (MediaFLO USA), the Company’s wholly-owned wireless multimedia operator subsidiary. QSI also makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA-based products and services. Our strategy is to invest in CDMA-based 44 Table of Contents operators, licensed device manufacturers and start-up companies that we believe open new markets for CDMA technology, support the design and introduction of new CDMA-based products or possess unique capabilities or technology. Our MediaFLO USA subsidiary offers services over our nationwide multicasting network based on our MediaFLO MDS and FLO technology. This network is utilized as a shared resource for wireless operators and their customers in the United States. The commercial availability of the MediaFLO USA network and service will continue to be determined by our wireless operator partners. MediaFLO USA’s network uses the 700 MHz spectrum for which we hold licenses nationwide. Additionally, MediaFLO USA has and will continue to procure, aggregate and distribute content in service packages which we will make available on a wholesale basis to our wireless operator customers (whether they operate on CDMA or GSM/WCDMA networks) in the United States. Distribution, marketing, billing and customer relationships remain services provided by our wireless operator partners. As part of our strategic investment activities, we intend to pursue various exit strategies at some point in the future, which may include distribution of our ownership interest in MediaFLO USA to our stockholders in a spin-off transaction. Nonreportable segments include: the Qualcomm MEMS Technologies division, which is developing an IMOD display technology based on micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) structure combined with thin film optics; the Qualcomm Flarion Technologies division, which is developing OFDM/OFDMA technologies; the MediaFLO Technologies division, which is developing our MediaFLO MDS and FLO technology and markets MediaFLO for deployment outside of the United States; and other product initiatives. Looking Forward The deployment of 3G networks (CDMA2000 and WCDMA) enables higher voice capacity and data rates, thereby supporting more minutes of use and data intensive applications like multimedia. As a result, we expect continued growth in demand for 3G products and services around the world. As we look forward to the next several months, the following items are likely to have an impact on our business: • The deployment of CDMA2000 networks is expected to continue. • More than 230 operators have launched CDMA2000 1X; (1) • More than 75 operators have deployed the higher data speeds of 1xEV-DO and 10 operators have deployed, and several more are preparing to deploy EV-DO Revision A. (1) • GSM operators are expected to continue transitioning to WCDMA networks. • More than 180 GSM operators have migrated their networks to WCDMA; (2) • More than 140 operators have launched commercial HSDPA networks and manufacturers are beginning to test and deploy the faster uplink speeds of HSUPA. (2) • We expect WCDMA device prices will continue to segment into high and low end due to high volumes and vibrant competition in marketplaces around the world. As more operators deploy the higher data speeds of HSPA, we expect consumer demand for advanced 3G devices to accelerate. • To meet growing demand for advanced 3G wireless devices and increased multimedia MSM functionality, we intend to continue to invest significant resources toward the development of multimedia products, software and services for the wireless industry. However, we expect that a portion of our research and development initiatives in fiscal 2008 will not reach commercialization until several years in the future. • We expect demand for low-end wireless devices to continue and have developed a family of Qualcomm Single Chip (QSC) products, which integrate the baseband, radio frequency and power management functions into one chip, lowering component counts and enabling faster time-to-market for our customers. While we continue to invest resources aggressively to expand our QSC product family to address the low-end market more effectively with CDMA-based products, we still face significant competition from GSM-based products, particularly in emerging markets. 45 Table of Contents • We will continue to invest in the evolution of CDMA and a broad range of other technologies as part of our vision to enable a range of technologies, each optimized for specific services, including the following products and technologies: • The continued evolution of CDMA-based technologies, including the long-term roadmaps of 1xEV-DO and High Speed Packet Access (HSPA); • OFDM and OFDMA-based technologies; • Our BREW applications platform, content delivery services and user interfaces; • Our MediaFLO MDS and FLO technology for delivery of multimedia content; and • Our IMOD display technology. In addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, the following items are likely to have an impact on our business and results of operations over the next several months: • We expect that we will continue to be involved in litigation, including our ongoing disputes with Broadcom and Nokia, and to appear in front of administrative and regulatory bodies, including the European Commission, the Korea Fair Trade Commission and the Japan Fair Trade Commission to defend our business model and, in some cases, to thwart efforts by companies to gain competitive advantage or negotiating leverage. • We have been and continue to consider reasonable ways that we can be of assistance to our customers, including in some cases certain levels of financial support to minimize the impact of the litigation in which we are involved. • We will continue to devote resources to working with and educating all participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless market. However, we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. We expect that such companies will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world. (1) According to public reports made available at www.cdg.org.

Further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the Risk Factors included in this Annual Report. Revenue Concentrations Revenues from customers in South Korea, China, Japan and the United States comprised 31%, 21%, 17% and 13%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2007, as compared to 32%, 17%, 21% and 13%, respectively, for fiscal 2006, and 37%, 11%, 21% and 18%, respectively, in fiscal 2005. We distinguish revenues from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to which our products, software or services are delivered and, for QTL’s licensing and royalty revenues, the domicile of our licensees. The increase in revenues from customers in China from 11% and 17% of total revenues in fiscal 2005 and 2006, respectively, to 21% in fiscal 2007 is primarily attributable to increased shipments of integrated circuits to CDMA device manufacturers with locations in China. The increasing trend in revenues from customers in China is expected to continue. Combined revenues from customers in South Korea, Japan and the United States decreased as a percentage of total revenues, from 76% in fiscal 2005 to 66% in fiscal 2006 and 61% in fiscal 2007, primarily due to increases in the percentage of revenues from WCDMA manufacturers in Western Europe and increased activity by manufacturers with locations in China. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and 46 Table of Contents judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets and investments, share-based payments, income taxes, and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others. Revenue Recognition. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, from royalties and license fees for our intellectual property, from messaging and other services and related hardware sales and from software development and licensing and related services. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but actual results may differ from our estimates. We record reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special pricing agreements and other volume-related rebate programs. Such reductions to revenue are estimates, based on a number of factors, including our assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes and the contractual provisions of our customer agreements. We license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD and/or the OFDMA standards and their derivatives. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of future benefit to the average licensee, typically five to seven years. We earn royalties on such licensed CDMA products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees’ sales occur. Our licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter, and, in some instances, although royalties are reported quarterly, payment is on a semi-annual basis. We recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter. From time to time, licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal disputes, and when this occurs, the timing and comparability of royalty revenue could be affected. Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. As of September 30, 2007, our goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $1.3 billion and $664 million, respectively. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. We assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We hold minority investments in publicly-traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile. We also hold investments in other marketable securities, including non-investment grade debt securities, equity and debt mutual funds, corporate bonds/notes and mortgage/asset-backed securities. These investments, which are recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally recorded through stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income or loss, totaled $9.4 billion at September 30, 2007. We record impairment charges through the statement of 47 Table of Contents operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. In addition, the fair values of our strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring impairment charges in the future. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been less than its original cost, the performance of the investee’s stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry, the market in general and analyst recommendations, as applicable. We also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties. In the event our judgments change as to other-than-temporary declines in value, we may record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded $16 million, $20 million and $13 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary losses on our investments in marketable securities. We hold minority strategic investments in private companies whose values are difficult to determine. These investments totaled $114 million at September 30, 2007. We record impairment charges when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other-than-temporary. The determination that a decline is other-than-temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future. When assessing investments in private companies for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the share price from the investee’s latest financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets and its business plan, the investee’s revenue and cost trends, the investee’s liquidity and cash position, including its cash burn rate, and market acceptance of the investee’s products and services. From time to time, we may consider third party evaluations, valuation reports or advice from investment banks. We also consider new products/services that the investee may have forthcoming, any significant news specific to the investee or the investee’s competitors and/or industry and the outlook of the overall industry in which the investee operates. In the event our judgments change as to other-than temporary declines in value, we may record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, we recorded $11 million, $4 million and $1 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary losses on our investments in private companies. Due to financial and competitive challenges facing our investees, we cannot assure you that our investments will generate financial returns or that we will not have to write down our investments. Share-Based Payments. We grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our equity compensation plans. Eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six-month offering period under our employee stock purchase plans. The benefits provided under these plans are share-based payments subject to the provisions of revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (FAS 123R), “Share-Based Payment.” We use the fair value method to apply the provisions of FAS 123R with a modified prospective application. Under the modified prospective application method, prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. Share-based compensation expense recognized under FAS 123R for fiscal 2007 and 2006 was $493 million and $495 million, respectively. At September 30, 2007, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non-vested stock options granted prior to that date was $1.3 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.4 years. Net stock options, after forfeitures and cancellations, granted during fiscal 2007 represented 2.0% of outstanding shares as of the beginning of the fiscal period. Total stock options granted during fiscal 2007 represented 2.3% of outstanding shares as of the end of the fiscal period. We estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a lattice binomial option-pricing model (binomial model). The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option-pricing models to estimate share-based compensation under FAS 123R. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions, are fully transferable and do not cause dilution. Because our share-based payments have characteristics significantly different 48 Table of Contents from those of freely traded options, and because valuation model assumptions are subjective, in our opinion, existing valuation models, including the Black-Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share-based compensation awards. There is not currently a generally accepted market-based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models. Although we estimate the fair value of employee share-based awards in accordance with FAS 123R and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107), the option-pricing model we use may not produce a value that is indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction. For purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2007, we used the implied volatility of market-traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the binomial model. We utilized the term structure of volatility up to approximately two years, and we used the implied volatility of the option with the longest time to maturity for the expected volatility estimates for periods beyond two years. The weighted-average volatility assumption was 33.4% for fiscal 2007, which if increased to 37%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2007 by $0.80 per share, or 5%. The volatility percentage assumed for fiscal 2007 and 2006 was based on the implied volatility of traded options, as compared to the blend of implied and historical volatility data used in prior years. FAS 123R includes implied volatility in its list of factors that should be considered in estimating expected volatility. We believe implied volatility is more useful than historical volatility in estimating expected volatility because it is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury strip securities for a period consistent with the contractual life of the option in effect at the time of grant. The weighted-average risk-free interest rate assumption was 4.6% for fiscal 2007, which if increased to 6.5%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2007 by $0.95 per share, or 7%. We do not target a specific dividend yield for our policy on dividend payments, but we are required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the binomial model. The dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts. The dividend yield assumption was 1.3% for fiscal 2007, which if decreased to 0.4%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2007 by $0.96 per share, or 7%. Dividends and/or increases or decreases in dividend payments are subject to board approval as well as to future cash inflows and outflows resulting from operating performance, stock repurchase programs, mergers and acquisitions, and other sources and uses of cash. While our historical dividend rate is assumed to continue in the future, it may be subject to substantial change, and investors should not depend upon this forecast as a reliable indication of future cash distributions that will be made to investors. The post-vesting forfeiture rate is estimated using historical option cancellation information. The weighted-average post-vesting forfeiture rate assumption was 6.5% for fiscal 2007, which if decreased to 1.5%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2007 by $0.73 per share, or 5%. The suboptimal exercise factor is estimated using historical option exercise information. The weighted-average suboptimal exercise factor assumption was 1.8 for fiscal 2007, which if increased to 2.1, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2007 by $0.66 per share, or 5%. Income Taxes. Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. As part of our assessment of potential adjustments to our tax returns, we increase our current tax liability to the extent an adjustment would result in a cash tax payment or decrease our deferred tax assets to the extent an adjustment would not result in a cash tax payment. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. For example, during fiscal 2007, we recorded an income tax benefit of $331 million resulting from the completion of audits of our fiscal 2003 and 2004 federal tax returns. 49 Table of Contents We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. As of September 30, 2007, gross deferred tax assets were $1.08 billion. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results. As of September 30, 2007, we had gross deferred tax assets of $192 million related to realized and unrealized capital losses and $14 million related to foreign net operating losses. We can only use capital losses to offset capital gains. Based upon our assessments of projected future capital gains and losses and related tax planning strategies, we expect that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all the capital losses that we have incurred through fiscal 2007. Therefore, we have provided a $6 million valuation allowance for the portion of capital losses we do not expect to utilize. We can only use foreign net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in certain foreign tax jurisdictions. Based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities, we expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the foreign net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal 2007. Therefore, we have provided a full valuation allowance for these net operating losses. Significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future capital gains, the timing of realization of capital losses and the amount of future taxable income in certain foreign jurisdictions. Adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses, capital gains and foreign taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made. We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. No provision has been made for United States federal and state, or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of which is approximately $4.7 billion as of September 30, 2007. Should we repatriate foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is made. With the adoption of FAS 123R in fiscal 2006, we recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders’ equity only when realized. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits occurring from September 26, 2005 onward. A windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee’s disposition of a share-based award exceeds the deferred tax asset, if any, associated with the award that we had recorded. When assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share-based compensation has been realized, we follow the tax law ordering method, under which current year share-based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. Litigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions. We estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Other than amounts relating to the Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM Incorporated and QUALCOMM Incorporated v. Broadcom Corporation matters, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with any other legal proceedings based on our belief that additional liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations. 50 Table of Contents Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2007 were $8.87 billion, compared to $7.53 billion for fiscal 2006. Revenues from three customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI segments (each of whom accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the period) comprised approximately 41% and 39% in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2007 were $5.77 billion, compared to $4.78 billion for fiscal 2006. Revenues from sales of integrated circuit products increased $922 million, resulting primarily from an increase of $761 million related to higher unit shipments, mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, and an increase of $144 million related to the net effects of changes in product mix and the average sales prices of such products. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2007 were $3.11 billion, compared to $2.75 billion for fiscal 2006. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees increased primarily as a result of a $306 million increase in royalties reported to QTL by our external licensees resulting from an increase in sales of CDMA-based products by licensees and a $30 million increase in QIS revenues primarily related to our expanded BREW customer base and products and a licensing agreement with Sprint. Worldwide demand for CDMA-based products has increased primarily as a result of the growth in sales of high-end WCDMA products and shifts in the geographic distribution of sales of CDMA2000 products. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2007 was $2.68 billion, compared to $2.18 billion for fiscal 2006. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 47% for fiscal 2007, compared to 46% for fiscal 2006. Cost of equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2007 included $39 million in share-based compensation, compared to $41 million in fiscal 2006. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2007, research and development expenses were $1.83 billion or 21% of revenues, compared to $1.54 billion or 20% of revenues for fiscal 2006. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $283 million increase in costs related to integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower cost devices, the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third party operating systems and services platforms. The technologies supporting these initiatives may include CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO Revision B, WCDMA (including GSM/GPRS/EDGE), HSDPA, HSUPA and OFDMA. The increase in research and development expenses incurred also related to the development of our FLO technology, MediaFLO MDS and IMOD display products using MEMS technology. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2007 included share-based compensation and in-process research and development of $221 million and $10 million, respectively, compared to $216 million and $22 million, respectively, in fiscal 2006. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2007, selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.48 billion or 17% of revenues, compared to $1.12 billion or 15% of revenues for fiscal 2006. The dollar and percentage increases were primarily attributable to a $152 million increase in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, a $98 million increase in employee related expenses, a $40 million increase in other professional fees, a $39 million increase in bad debt expense, a $32 million increase in cooperative and other marketing expenses and a $28 million increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a $44 million gain on the sale of a building. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 included share-based compensation of $233 million, compared to $238 million in fiscal 2006. 51 Table of Contents Net Investment Income. Net investment income was $743 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $466 million for fiscal 2006. The net increase was primarily comprised as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 30, September 24, 2007 2006 Change Interest and dividend income: Corporate and other segments $ 551 $ 410 $ 141 QSI 7 6 1 Interest expense (11 ) (4 ) (7 ) Net realized gains on investments: Corporate and other segments 201 106 95 QSI 21 30 (9 ) Other-than-temporary losses on investments (27 ) (24 ) (3 ) Gains (losses) on derivative instruments 2 (29 ) 31 Equity in losses of investees (1 ) (29 ) 28 $ 743 $ 466 $ 277 The increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates on interest-bearing securities. Net realized gains on corporate investments increased primarily due to strength in the equity markets and reallocation of certain portfolio assets. Losses on derivative instruments in fiscal 2006 related primarily to changes in the fair values of put options sold in connection with our stock repurchase program. Equity in losses of investees in fiscal 2006 resulted primarily from the effect of investment losses recognized by Inquam and a venture fund investee in fiscal 2006, of which our share was $20 million and $11 million, respectively. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $323 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $686 million for fiscal 2006. The annual effective tax rate was 9% for fiscal 2007, compared to 22% for fiscal 2006. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 is lower than the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 primarily due to the impact of prior year audits completed during fiscal 2007 and additional foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal statutory tax rate. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 is 26% lower than the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 20% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, 9% related to the impact of the tax audits completed during the year and 2% related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by state taxes of approximately 5%. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2006 were $7.53 billion, compared to $5.67 billion for fiscal 2005. Revenues from three customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI segments comprised an aggregate of 39% of total consolidated revenues in both fiscal 2006 and 2005. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2006 were $4.78 billion, compared to $3.74 billion for fiscal 2005. Revenues from sales of integrated circuits increased $1.00 billion, resulting primarily from an increase of $1.34 billion related primarily to higher unit shipments of MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, partially offset by a decrease of $349 million related to the net effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2006 were $2.75 billion, compared to $1.93 billion for fiscal 2005. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees increased primarily as a result of a $774 million increase in royalty revenue, consisting primarily of royalties reported to QTL by our external licensees, resulting from an increase in sales of CDMA-based products by licensees and the impact of the expiration of one of our royalty sharing obligations. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2006 was $2.18 billion, compared to $1.65 billion for fiscal 2005. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 46% for fiscal 2006, compared to 44% for fiscal 2005. The decline in margin percentage in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 was primarily due to the effect of $41 million in share-based compensation during fiscal 2006 as a result of the adoption of FAS123R during fiscal 2006 and a decrease in QCT margin percentage resulting primarily from an increase in product support costs. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2006, research and development expenses were $1.54 billion or 20% of revenues, compared to $1.01 billion or 18% of revenues for fiscal 2005. Research and development 52 Table of Contents expenses for fiscal 2006 included share-based compensation of $216 million as a result of the adoption of FAS 123R during fiscal 2006 and in-process research and development of $22 million resulting from acquisitions, both of which caused the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of revenues. The dollar increase in research and development expenses also included a $272 million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products and other initiatives to support lower cost devices, multimedia applications, high-speed wireless internet access and multimode, multiband, multinetwork products and technologies, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO Revision B, WCDMA (including GSM/GPRS/EDGE), HSDPA, HSUPA and OFDMA, and the development of our FLO technology, MediaFLO MDS and iMoD display products using MEMS technology. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2006, selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.12 billion or 15% of revenues, compared to $631 million or 11% of revenues for fiscal 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2006 included share-based compensation of $238 million as a result of the adoption of FAS 123R during fiscal 2006. The percentage increase was primarily attributable to the share-based compensation. The dollar increase was also attributable to a $107 million increase in professional fees, primarily related to legal activities, a $90 million increase in employee-related expenses, a $14 million increase in selling and marketing expenses and a $14 million decrease in other income. Net Investment Income. Net investment income was $466 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $423 million for fiscal 2005. The change was primarily comprised as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 24, 2006 September 25, 2005 Change Interest and dividend income: Corporate and other segments $ 410 $ 252 $ 158 QSI 6 4 2 Interest expense (4 ) (3 ) (1 ) Net realized gains on investments: Corporate and other segments 106 78 28 QSI 30 101 (71 ) Other-than-temporary losses on investments (24 ) (14 ) (10 ) (Losses) gains on derivative instruments (29 ) 33 (62 ) Equity in losses of investees (29 ) (28 ) (1 ) $ 466 $ 423 $ 43 The increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates earned on interest-bearing securities. Net realized gains on QSI investments in fiscal 2005 resulted primarily from a $48 million gain on our minority investment in a wireless publisher and a $41 million gain on the sale of our investment in a wireless telecommunications company. Losses and gains on derivative instruments in fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively, related primarily to changes in the fair values of put options sold in connection with our stock repurchase program. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $686 million for fiscal 2006, compared to $666 million for fiscal 2005. The annual effective tax rate was approximately 22% for fiscal 2006, compared to 24% for fiscal 2005. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was lower than the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2005 primarily due to an increase in foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal tax rate. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 was 13% lower than the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 15% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, 2% related to the impact of prior year tax audits completed during the year, 1% related to an increase in tax benefits resulting from our increased ability to use our capital loss carryforwards and 1% related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by state taxes of approximately 5% and other permanent differences of 1%. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 The following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2007 and 2006 financial results for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 10 — Segment Information.” 53 Table of Contents QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2007 were $5.28 billion, compared to $4.33 billion for fiscal 2006. Equipment and services revenues, mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, were $5.12 billion for fiscal 2007, compared to $4.20 billion for fiscal 2006. The increase in equipment and services revenue resulted primarily from an increase of $761 million related to higher unit shipments and an increase of $144 million related to the net effects of changes in product mix and the average sales prices of such products. Approximately 253 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2007, compared to approximately 207 million for fiscal 2006. QCT’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2007 were $1.55 billion, compared to $1.30 billion for fiscal 2006. QCT’s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage) was 29% in fiscal 2007, compared to 30% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in operating margin percentage was primarily due to increases in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in the gross margin percentage. QCT inventories increased by 116% in fiscal 2007 from $179 million to $387 million due to increased purchases of completed die directly from foundry suppliers for use in QCT’s CDMA-based integrated circuit products in connection with the shift in our manufacturing business model from turnkey to IFM. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2007 were $2.77 billion, compared to $2.47 billion for fiscal 2006. QTL’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2007 were $2.34 billion, compared to $2.23 billion for fiscal 2006. QTL’s operating margin percentage was 84% in fiscal 2007, compared to 90% in fiscal 2006. The increase in revenues primarily resulted from a $306 million increase in royalties reported to us by our external licensees, which were $2.72 billion in fiscal 2007, compared to $2.42 billion in fiscal 2006. Revenues from amortized license fees were $49 million in fiscal 2007, compared to $50 million in fiscal 2006. The increase in earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in legal and bad debt expenses, which resulted in a corresponding decline in operating margin percentage. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2007 were $828 million, compared to $731 million for fiscal 2006. Revenues increased primarily due to increases of $78 million and $11 million in QIS and QES revenues, respectively. The increase in QIS revenues is primarily attributable to a $61 million increase in QChat revenues resulting from increased development efforts under a licensing agreement with Sprint and an $18 million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products. The increase in QES revenues is primarily attributable to a $26 million increase in equipment and messaging revenues, partially offset by a $15 million decrease in amortization of deferred revenues related to historical equipment sales. QES shipped approximately 190,300 terrestrial-based and satellite-based systems during fiscal 2007, compared to approximately 140,300 terrestrial-based and satellite-based systems in fiscal 2006. QWI’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2007 were $88 million, compared to $78 million for fiscal 2006. QWI’s operating margin percentage was 11% in fiscal 2007, compared to 10% in fiscal 2006. The increase in QWI’s earnings before taxes was primarily due to a $54 million increase in QIS gross margin, largely resulting from our expanded BREW customer base and products and QChat development efforts, partially offset by a $29 million increase in QWI selling, general and administrative expenses and an $18 million decrease in QES gross margin. The increase in QWI’s operating margin percentage was primarily attributable to the increase in QIS gross margin, partially offset by the decrease in QES gross margin. QSI Segment. QSI’s loss before taxes for fiscal 2007 was $240 million, compared to $133 million for fiscal 2006. QSI’s loss before taxes included a $118 million increase in our MediaFLO USA subsidiary’s loss before taxes comprised primarily of $70 million in cost of services revenues related to the commencement of our MediaFLO services in March 2007 and a $42 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, including $20 million related to cooperative marketing expenses. During fiscal 2006, QSI recorded $30 million in equity in losses of investees resulting primarily from the effect of investment losses recognized by Inquam and a venture fund investee in fiscal 2006, of which our share was $20 million and $11 million, respectively. Equity in losses of investees was nominal during fiscal 2007. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results of fiscal 2006 and 2005 for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10 — Segment Information.” 54 Table of Contents QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2006 were $4.33 billion, compared to $3.29 billion for fiscal 2005. Equipment and services revenues, primarily from MSM and accompanying RF integrated circuits, were $4.20 billion for fiscal 2006, compared to $3.20 billion for fiscal 2005. The increase in equipment and services revenue was primarily comprised of an increase of $1.34 billion related to higher unit shipments, partially offset by a decrease of $349 million related to the effects of reductions in average sales prices and changes in product mix. Approximately 207 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2006, compared to approximately 151 million for fiscal 2005. QCT’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2006 were $1.30 billion, compared to $980 million for fiscal 2005. QCT’s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage) was 30% during both fiscal 2006 and 2005. The operating margin percentage remained consistent as the gross margin percentage decrease, resulting primarily from an increase in product support costs, was offset by a decrease in research and development expenses as a percentage of QCT revenue. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2006 were $2.47 billion, compared to $1.71 billion for fiscal 2005. QTL’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2006 were $2.23 billion, compared to $1.54 billion for fiscal 2005. QTL’s operating margin percentage was 90% in fiscal 2006 as compared to 89% in fiscal 2005. The increase in both revenues and earnings before taxes primarily resulted from a $774 million increase in royalties reported to us by our licensees, which were $2.42 billion in fiscal 2006, compared to $1.64 billion in fiscal 2005. The increase in royalty revenue relates to the increase in sales of CDMA-based products by licensees and the impact of the expiration of one of our royalty sharing obligations. Revenues from amortized license fees were $50 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $69 million in fiscal 2005. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2006 were $731 million, compared to $682 million for fiscal 2005. Revenues increased primarily due to increases of $41 million and $11 million in QIS and QES revenues, respectively. The increase in QIS revenues was primarily attributable to a $28 million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products and a $17 million increase in QChat revenues resulting from increased development efforts under the licensing agreement with Sprint. The increase in QES revenues was primarily attributable to a $16 million increase in equipment revenue and a $14 million increase in messaging services revenue, partially offset by a $19 million decrease in amortization of deferred revenues related to historical equipment sales. QES shipped approximately 140,300 satellite-based and terrestrial-based systems during fiscal 2006, compared to approximately 156,700 satellite-based and terrestrial-based systems in fiscal 2005. QWI’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2006 were $78 million, compared to $62 million for fiscal 2005. QWI’s operating margin percentage was 10% in fiscal 2006, compared to 9% in fiscal 2005. The increase in QWI earnings before taxes was primarily due to a $39 million increase in QIS gross margin largely resulting from the increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products and QChat development efforts, partially offset by the effect of a $23 million increase in QWI research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. The increase in QWI’s operating margin percentage was primarily due to the increase in QIS gross margin. QSI Segment. QSI’s loss before taxes for fiscal 2006 was $133 million, compared to earnings before taxes of $10 million for fiscal 2005. QSI’s loss before taxes included a $55 million increase in our MediaFLO USA subsidiary’s operating expenses. During fiscal 2006, QSI recorded $30 million in realized gains on marketable securities and other investments, compared to $101 million in fiscal 2005. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $11.8 billion at September 30, 2007, an increase of $1.9 billion from September 24, 2006. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2007 consisted of $5.5 billion held by foreign subsidiaries with the remaining balance of $6.3 billion held domestically. Due to tax considerations, we derive liquidity for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and investments held domestically. Cash provided by operating activities was $3.8 billion during fiscal 2007, compared to $3.3 billion during fiscal 2006. Net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans was $556 million during fiscal 2007, compared to $692 million during fiscal 2006. 55 Table of Contents On May 22, 2007, we announced we had been authorized to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of our common stock. The $3.0 billion stock repurchase program replaced a $2.5 billion stock repurchase program, of which approximately $0.9 billion remained authorized for repurchases. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. During fiscal 2007, we repurchased and retired 37,263,000 shares of our common stock for $1.5 billion. In connection with the stock repurchase program, we have put options outstanding, with expiration dates ranging from December 2007 through March 2008, that may require us to repurchase an aggregate of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock upon exercise for $189 million (net of the option premiums received). Any shares repurchased upon exercise of put options will be retired. At September 30, 2007, $1.5 billion remains authorized for repurchases under our stock repurchase program, net of put options outstanding. In the period from October 1, 2007 through November 7, 2007 we repurchased and retired 12,720,000 shares of our own common stock for approximately $525 million. We will continue our active evaluation of repurchases under this program. We declared and paid dividends totaling $862 million, $698 million and $524 million, or $0.52, $0.42 and $0.32 per common share, during fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. On October 11, 2007, we announced a cash dividend of $0.14 per share on our common stock, payable on January 4, 2008 to stockholders of record as of December 7, 2007. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. Accounts receivable increased by 2% during fiscal 2007. Days sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, were 27 days at September 30, 2007 compared to 29 days at September 24, 2006. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the increase in revenue in fiscal 2007 as compared to fiscal 2006 and the contractual timing of cash receipts for royalty receivables, some of which are paid semi-annually. The change in days sales outstanding was a result of the increase in revenue, partially offset by the effect of the increase in accounts receivable. We intend to continue our strategic investment activities to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA-based products and the growth of CDMA-based wireless data and wireless internet products. As part of these investment activities, we may provide financing to facilitate the marketing and sale of CDMA equipment by authorized suppliers. In the event additional needs or uses for cash arise, we may raise additional funds from a combination of sources including potential debt and equity issuance. We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and cash generated from operations will satisfy our expected working and other capital requirements for the foreseeable future based on current business plans, including acquisitions, investments in other companies and other assets to support the growth of our business, financing and other commitments, the payment of dividends and possible additional stock repurchases. Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in S-K 303(a)(4)(ii). At September 30, 2007, our outstanding contractual obligations included (in millions): Contractual Obligations Payments Due By Fiscal Period No Expiration Total 2008 2009-2010 2011-2012 Beyond 2012 Date Purchase obligations (1) $ 1,052 $ 760 $ 193 $ 91 $ 8 $ — Operating leases 390 75 113 63 139 — Other commitments (2) 50 — — 40 3 7 Total commitments 1,492 835 306 194 150 7 Capital leases (3) 200 6 12 12 170 — Other long-term liabilities (4) 15 — 10 1 4 — Total recorded liabilities 215 6 22 13 174 — Total $ 1,707 $ 841 $ 328 $ 207 $ 324 $ 7 (1) Total purchase obligations include $615 million in commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories. (2) Certain of these commitments do not have fixed funding dates. Amounts are presented based on the expiration of the commitment, but actual funding may occur earlier or not at all as funding is subject to certain conditions. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed or funded under these arrangements; actual financing or funding may be in lesser amounts. (3) Amounts represent future minimum lease payments including interest payments. Capital lease obligations are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2007. (4) Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenue, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. 56 Table of Contents Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 30, 2007 is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 4 — Investments in Other Entities” and “Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies.” Future Accounting Requirements In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48) “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. Additionally, FIN 48 provides guidance on the derecognition, classification, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions. The accounting provisions of FIN 48 are effective for us beginning October 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of initially adopting FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption and will be presented separately. Only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of FIN 48. We are in the process of finalizing the impact the adoption of FIN 48 will have on our consolidated financial statements but expect the adjustment to opening retained earnings to be immaterial. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. We invest our cash in a number of diversified investment and non-investment grade fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and debt mutual funds. Changes in the general level of United States interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed interest-bearing securities. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed interest-bearing securities could lose value. If the general economy were to weaken significantly, the credit profile, financial strength and growth prospects of issuers of interest-bearing securities held in our investment portfolios could deteriorate, and our interest-bearing securities could lose value. We may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs that do not perform well. The following table provides information about our interest-bearing securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows, weighted average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes. 57 Table of Contents Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal Amount by Expected Maturity Average Interest Rates (Dollars in millions) No Single 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Maturity Total Fixed interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 543 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 543 Interest rate 5.4 % Available-for-sale securities: Investment grade $ 1,851 $ 289 $ 163 $ 57 $ 20 $ 10 $ 405 $ 2,795 Interest rate 5.1 % 5.2 % 4.8 % 5.5 % 5.4 % 7.4 % 5.4 % Non-investment grade $ 12 $ 16 $ 13 $ 44 $ 41 $ 368 $ — $ 494 Interest rate 5.3 % 7.0 % 8.9 % 8.3 % 8.0 % 8.5 % Floating interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 1,719 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,719 Interest rate 5.4 % Available-for-sale securities: Investment grade $ 213 $ 214 $ 202 $ 56 $ 78 $ 94 $ 531 $ 1,388 Interest rate 5.5 % 5.7 % 5.8 % 5.7 % 5.9 % 5.8 % 5.8 % Non-investment grade $ 12 $ 11 $ 28 $ 65 $ 118 $ 391 $ 712 $ 1,337 Interest rate 6.7 % 7.0 % 7.3 % 7.4 % 7.1 % 7.4 % 7.1 % Cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Mortgage Risk. A small portion of our diversified investment program includes investment-grade mortgage- and asset-backed securities. In fiscal 2007, following a multi-year housing industry expansion, mortgage industry excesses became apparent and caused concern among investors in pools of residential mortgages or other assets securitized by them. We have no direct investments in the lowest credit quality, or subprime, mortgages nor investments collateralized by assets that include subprime mortgages. We have indirect exposure to subprime mortgages to the extent of our investments in large, diversified financial companies, commercial banks, insurance companies and public/private investment funds that participate or invest in subprime mortgage loans, mortgage insurance, or loan servicing, which could impact the fair values of our securities. Equity Price Risk. We have a diversified marketable securities portfolio, including mutual fund and exchange traded fund shares, that is subject to equity price risk. The recorded values of marketable equity securities increased to $1.52 billion at September 30, 2007 from $1.34 billion at September 24, 2006. The recorded values of equity mutual fund and exchange traded fund shares increased to $1.87 billion at September 30, 2007 from $1.52 billion at September 24, 2006. We make equity investments in companies of varying size, style, industry and geography, and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund and exchange traded fund shares at September 30, 2007 would cause a corresponding 10% decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of $339 million. Our strategic investments in other entities consist substantially of investments in private early-stage companies accounted for under the equity and cost methods. Accordingly, we believe that our exposure to market risk from these investments is not material. Additionally, we do not anticipate any near-term changes in the nature of our market risk exposures or in management’s objectives and strategies with respect to managing such exposures. The recorded values of these strategic investments totaled $114 million at September 30, 2007, compared to $93 million at September 24, 2006. In connection with our stock repurchase program, we sell put options that may require us to repurchase shares of our common stock at fixed prices. These written put options subject us to equity price risk. At September 30, 2007, we had two outstanding put options, enabling holders to sell 5,000,000 shares of our common stock upon exercise for approximately $189 million (net of the option premiums received). The put option liabilities, with a fair value of $10 million at September 30, 2007, were included in other current liabilities. If the fair value of our common stock at September 30, 2007 decreased by 15%, the amount required to physically settle the put options would exceed the fair value of the shares by $9 million, net of the $14 million in premiums received. 58 Table of Contents Additional information regarding our strategic investments is provided in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Annual Report. Foreign Exchange Risk. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, consisting primarily of foreign currency forward and option contracts. Such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. At September 30, 2007, we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. At September 30, 2007, we had a net liability of $1 million related to our foreign currency option contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of CDMA and WCDMA products. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by 30% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 30% in each of our hedged foreign currencies, we would incur a loss of approximately $6 million resulting from a decrease in fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 — The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies. Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies. Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks.",2023-12-30 18:21:46.602241
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Recent Developments Revenues for fiscal 2008 were $11.1 billion, with net income of $3.2 billion. The following recent developments occurred with respect to key elements of our business or our industry during fiscal 2008: During fiscal 2008: • Worldwide wireless subscribers grew by approximately 21% to reach approximately 3.8 billion.(1) • CDMA subscribers, including both 2G (cdmaOne) and 3G (CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA and HSPA), are approximately 19% of total worldwide wireless subscribers to date. (1) • 3G subscribers (all CDMA-based) grew to approximately 705 million worldwide by September 28, 2008, up approximately 33% year-over-year, including approximately 410 million CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO subscribers and approximately 295 million WCDMA/HSPA subscribers. (1) • CDMA-based device shipments totaled approximately 433 million units, an increase of 28% over the 338 million units shipped in fiscal 2007. (2) • In the handset market, CDMA-based unit shipments grew an estimated 27% year-over-year, compared to an estimated 14% year-over-year growth across all technologies. (3) • The average selling price of CDMA-based devices was estimated to be approximately $219, up 2% from the prior year. (2) • We shipped approximately 336 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) integrated circuits for CDMA-based wireless devices, an increase of 33%, compared to approximately 253 million MSM integrated circuits in fiscal 2007. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008: • We entered into new license and settlement agreements with Nokia Corporation/Nokia Inc. (Nokia) that cover GSM/GPRS/EDGE, CDMA2000, WCDMA (including HSPA), TD-SCDMA, OFDMA (including LTE, UMB and WiMax) and other products and resolve all pending litigation between the parties. Also, as a result, Nokia withdrew its complaint with the European Commission as to our licensing and other business practices. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, we recognized $560 million in revenues as a result of the execution of the agreements. Consideration provided to us under the new license agreement with Nokia included, among other things, a non-refundable up-front payment of $2.5 billion, ongoing royalties and the assignment of patents that we recorded in intangible assets in the amount of $1.8 billion.

(3) Based on current reports by Strategy Analytics, a global research and consulting firm, in their Global Handset Market Share Updates. Our Business and Operating Segments We design, manufacture, have manufactured on our behalf and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our CDMA technology and other technologies. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products, license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property, messaging and other services and related hardware sales, software development and licensing and related services, software hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content. Operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments. These segments are: Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, or QCT; Qualcomm Technology Licensing, or QTL; Qualcomm Wireless & Internet, or QWI; and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives, or QSI. 43 Table of Contents QCT is a leading developer and supplier of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning system products. QCT’s integrated circuit products and system software are used in wireless devices, particularly mobile phones, data cards and infrastructure equipment. The integrated circuits for wireless devices include the Mobile Station Modem (MSM), Radio Frequency (RF) and Power Management (PM) devices. These integrated circuits for wireless devices and system software perform voice and data communication, multimedia and global positioning functions, radio conversion between RF and baseband signals and power management. QCT’s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling phone manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. The infrastructure equipment integrated circuits and system software perform the core baseband CDMA modem functionality in the wireless operator’s base station equipment. QCT revenues comprised 60%, 59% and 58% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the assembly and final test manufacturing processes. We rely on independent third party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing business models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing business model, we purchase die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party manufacturers for back-end assembly and test services. We refer to this two-stage manufacturing business model as Integrated Fabless Manufacturing (IFM). QTL grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD, GSM/GPRS/EDGE and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives. QTL receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Ongoing royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale selling price of licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g. certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.), and/or based on a fixed per unit amount. QTL revenues comprised 33%, 31% and 33% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues have been generated through our licensees’ sales of cdmaOne, CDMA2000 and WCDMA products. QWI, which includes Qualcomm Enterprise Services (QES), Qualcomm Internet Services (QIS), Qualcomm Government Technologies (QGOV) and Firethorn, generates revenues primarily through mobile communication products and services, software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications. QES sells equipment, software and services used by transportation and other companies to connect wirelessly with their assets, products and workforce. QES also sells products that operate on the Globalstar low-Earth-orbit satellite-based telecommunications system and provides related services. Through September 2008, QES has shipped approximately 1,302,000 terrestrial-based and satellite-based communications systems. QIS provides BREW-based (Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless) products that include user interface and content delivery and management products and services for the wireless industry. QIS also provides QChat, which enables virtually instantaneous push-to-talk functionality on CDMA-based wireless devices. The QGOV division provides development, hardware and analytical expertise involving wireless communications technologies to United States government agencies. Firethorn builds and manages software applications that enable financial institutions and wireless operators to offer mobile commerce services. QWI revenues comprised 7%, 9% and 10% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. QSI manages the Company’s strategic investment activities, including MediaFLO USA, Inc. (MediaFLO USA), the Company’s wholly-owned wireless multimedia operator subsidiary. QSI also makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA-based products and services. Our strategy is to invest in CDMA-based operators, licensed device manufacturers and early-stage companies that we believe open new markets for CDMA technology, support the design and introduction of new CDMA-based products or possess unique capabilities or technology. Our MediaFLO USA subsidiary offers its service over our nationwide multicasting network based on our MediaFLO Media Distribution System (MDS) and FLO technology. This network is utilized as a shared resource for wireless operators and their customers in the United States. The commercial availability of the MediaFLO USA service to retail wireless consumers continues to be determined by our wireless operator partners. MediaFLO USA’s network uses the 700 MHz spectrum for which we hold licenses nationwide. Additionally, MediaFLO USA has and will continue to procure, aggregate and distribute content in service packages which we will make available on a wholesale basis to our wireless operator customers (regardless of whether they operate CDMA or GSM/WCDMA networks) in the United States. Distribution, marketing, billing and customer relationships remain functions that are provided primarily by our wireless operator partners. As part of our strategic investment activities, we intend to pursue various exit strategies at some point in the future, which may include distribution of our ownership interest in MediaFLO USA to our stockholders in a spin-off transaction. 44 Table of Contents Nonreportable segments include: the Qualcomm MEMS Technologies division, which is developing an interferometric modulator (IMOD) display technology based on micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) structure combined with thin film optics; the Qualcomm Flarion Technologies division, which is developing OFDM/OFDMA technologies; the MediaFLO Technologies division, which is developing our MediaFLO technology and markets MediaFLO for deployment outside of the United States; and other product initiatives. Looking Forward The deployment of 3G networks (CDMA2000 and WCDMA) enables higher voice capacity and data rates, thereby supporting more minutes of use and data intensive applications like multimedia. As a result, we expect continued growth in demand for 3G products and services around the world. As we look forward to the next several months, the following items are likely to have an impact on our business: • We believe the recent global financial crisis and the resulting slowdown in global economies is causing current contraction in the channel inventory and will likely result in lower consumer demand and prices for CDMA-based devices, among other things, adversely affecting our revenues and operating results. In addition, the financial crisis has, and may continue to have, an impact on the value of our marketable securities portfolio and net investment income. • The deployment and upgrading of CDMA2000 networks is expected to continue. o More than 275 wireless operators have launched CDMA2000 1X; (1) and o More than 100 wireless operators have deployed the higher data speeds of 1xEV-DO and more than 40 wireless operators have deployed commercial EV-DO Revision A networks. (1) • GSM operators are expected to continue transitioning to WCDMA networks. o More than 235 GSM operators have migrated their networks to WCDMA; (2) and o More than 220 wireless operators have upgraded and launched commercial HSDPA networks, and more than 50 wireless operators have upgraded and launched commercial HSUPA networks. (2) • We expect that CDMA-based device prices will continue to segment into high and low end due to high volumes and vibrant competition in marketplaces around the world. As more operators deploy the higher data speeds of HSPA and EV-DO Revision A and as manufacturers introduce additional highly-featured, converged devices, we expect consumer demand for advanced 3G devices to accelerate. • To meet growing demand for advanced 3G wireless devices and increased multimedia MSM functionality, we intend to continue to invest significant resources toward the development of multimedia products, software and services for the wireless industry. However, we expect that a portion of our research and development initiatives in fiscal 2009 will not reach commercialization until several years in the future. • We expect demand for low-end wireless devices to continue to grow and have developed a family of Qualcomm Single Chip (QSC) products, which integrate the baseband, radio frequency and power management functions into one chip, lowering component counts and enabling faster time-to-market for our customers. While we continue to invest resources aggressively to expand our QSC product family to address the low-end market more effectively with CDMA-based products, we still face significant competition from GSM-based products, particularly in emerging markets. • We will continue to invest in the evolution of CDMA and a broad range of other technologies as part of our vision to enable a range of technologies, each optimized for specific services, including the following products and technologies: o The continued evolution of CDMA-based technologies, including the long-term roadmaps of 1xEV-DO and High Speed Packet Access (HSPA); o OFDM and OFDMA-based technologies; o Our service applications platform, content delivery services and user interfaces; o Our MediaFLO MDS and FLO technology for delivery of multimedia content; and o Our IMOD display technology. 45 Table of Contents In addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, the following items are likely to have an impact on our business and results of operations over the next several months: • We will continue to devote resources to working with and educating all participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless market. However, we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. We expect that such companies will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world. For example, we expect that we will continue to be involved in litigation, including our ongoing disputes with Broadcom, and to appear in front of administrative and regulatory bodies, including the European Commission, the Korea Fair Trade Commission and the Japan Fair Trade Commission to defend our business model and to rebuff efforts by companies seeking to gain competitive advantage or negotiating leverage. • We have been and will continue evaluating and providing reasonable assistance to our customers. This includes, in some cases, certain levels of financial support to minimize the impact of the litigation in which we are involved. (1) According to public reports made available at www.cdg.org.

Further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the Risk Factors included in this Annual Report. Revenue Concentrations Revenues from customers in South Korea, China, Japan and the United States comprised 35%, 21%, 14% and 9%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2008, as compared to 31%, 21%, 17% and 13%, respectively, for fiscal 2007, and 32%, 17%, 21% and 13%, respectively, for fiscal 2006. We distinguish revenues from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to which our products, software or services are delivered and, for QTL’s licensing and royalty revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees. The increase in revenues from customers in South Korea from 32% and 31% of total revenues in fiscal 2006 and 2007, respectively, to 35% in fiscal 2008 is primarily attributable to increased shipments of integrated circuits to CDMA device manufacturers with locations in South Korea and royalty revenues from customers in South Korea. Combined revenues from customers in Japan and the United States decreased as a percentage of total revenues, from 34% in fiscal 2006 to 30% in fiscal 2007 and 23% in fiscal 2008, primarily due to the increased activity by manufacturers with locations in South Korea. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets and investments, share-based payments, income taxes and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others. 46 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, royalties and license fees for our intellectual property, messaging and other services and related hardware sales, software development and licensing and related services, software hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but actual results may differ from our estimates. We record reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special pricing agreements and other volume-related rebate programs. Such reductions to revenue are estimates, based on a number of factors, including our assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes and the contractual provisions of our customer agreements. We license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit to the licensee, typically five to fifteen years. We earn royalties on such licensed products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees’ sales occur. Our licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter. We recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met. From time to time, licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal disputes, and when this occurs, the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected. Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. We also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions. As of September 28, 2008, our goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $1.5 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. For intangible assets purchased in a business combination or received in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets received (or, for non-monetary exchanges, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values, except when neither the values of the assets received or the assets transferred in non-monetary exchanges are determinable within reasonable limits. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. An estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions which require significant judgment. For example, the income approach generally requires assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows, total addressable market, pricing and share forecasts, competition, technology obsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of certain assets may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models. New information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recovered. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We hold minority investments in publicly-traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile. We also hold investments in other marketable securities, including non-investment grade debt securities, equity and debt mutual and exchange traded funds, corporate bonds and notes, auction rate securities and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. These investments, which are recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally recorded through stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income or loss, totaled $9.4 billion at September 28, 2008. We record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. In addition, the fair values of our strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring impairment charges. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been below its original cost, the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default or recovery rates of securities in an asset class, negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others, the performance and pricing of the investee’s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations, as applicable. We also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, we may record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, we recorded $502 million, $16 million and $20 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary losses on our investments in marketable securities. 47 Table of Contents Share-Based Payments. We grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our equity compensation plans. Eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six-month offering period under our employee stock purchase plans. The benefits provided under these plans are share-based payments subject to the provisions of revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (FAS 123R), “Share-Based Payment.” We use the fair value method to apply the provisions of FAS 123R. Share-based compensation expense recognized under FAS 123R for fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006 was $543 million, $493 million and $495 million, respectively. At September 28, 2008, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non-vested stock options granted prior to that date was $1.6 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.5 years. Net stock options, after forfeitures and cancellations, granted during fiscal 2008 represented 2.7% of outstanding shares as of the beginning of the fiscal period. Total stock options granted during fiscal 2008 represented 3.2% of outstanding shares as of the end of the fiscal period. We estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a lattice binomial option-pricing model (binomial model). The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option-pricing models to estimate share-based compensation under FAS 123R. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions, are fully transferable and do not cause dilution. Because our share-based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because valuation model assumptions are subjective, in our opinion, existing valuation models, including the Black-Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share-based compensation awards. There is not currently a generally accepted market-based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models. Although we estimate the fair value of employee share-based awards in accordance with FAS 123R and the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107), the option-pricing model we use may not produce a value that is indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction. For purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2008, we used the implied volatility of market-traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the binomial model. We utilized the term structure of volatility up to approximately two years, and we used the implied volatility of the option with the longest time to maturity for the expected volatility estimates for periods beyond two years. The weighted-average volatility assumption was 41.1% for fiscal 2008, which if increased to 45%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2008 by $0.89 per share, or 5%. FAS 123R includes implied volatility in its list of factors that should be considered in estimating expected volatility. We believe implied volatility is more useful than historical volatility in estimating expected volatility because it is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury strip securities for a period consistent with the contractual life of the option in effect at the time of grant. The weighted-average risk-free interest rate assumption was 3.8% for fiscal 2008, which if increased to 6.5% would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2008 by $1.17 per share, or 7%. We do not target a specific dividend yield for our policy on dividend payments, but we are required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the binomial model. The dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts. The dividend yield assumption was 1.3% for fiscal 2008, which if decreased to 0.4% would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2008 by $0.92 per share, or 6%. Dividends and/or increases or decreases in dividend payments are subject to approval by our Board of Directors as well as to future cash inflows and outflows resulting from operating performance, stock repurchase programs, mergers and acquisitions, and other sources and uses of cash. While our historical dividend rate is assumed to continue in the future, it may be subject to substantial change, and investors should not depend upon this forecast as a reliable indication of future cash distributions that will be made to investors. 48 Table of Contents The post-vesting forfeiture rate is estimated using historical option cancellation information. The weighted-average post-vesting forfeiture rate assumption was 8.0% for fiscal 2008, which if decreased to 1.5%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2008 by $0.91 per share, or 6%. The suboptimal exercise factor is estimated using historical option exercise information. The weighted-average suboptimal exercise factor assumption was 1.9 for fiscal 2008, which if increased to 2.3, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2008 by $1.01 per share or 6%. Income Taxes. On October 1, 2007, we adopted the accounting provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48 (FIN 48), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes.” As a result of the adoption, we increased our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions by $2 million and accounted for the cumulative effect of this change as a decrease to retained earnings. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5 – Income Taxes” for additional information. As of September 28, 2008, our liability for net unrecognized tax benefits was $227 million. Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. As a result of the implementation of FIN 48, we recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on the two-step process prescribed in the interpretation. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. For example, during fiscal 2007, we recorded an income tax benefit of $331 million resulting from the completion of audits of our fiscal 2003 and 2004 federal tax returns. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. As of September 28, 2008, gross deferred tax assets were $1.4 billion. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results. As of September 28, 2008, we had gross deferred tax assets of $430 million related to capital losses and $21 million related to foreign and state net operating losses. We can only use realized capital losses to offset realized capital gains. Based upon our assessments of when capital gains and losses will be realized, we estimate that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all of the temporary and other-than-temporary capital losses that were recorded through fiscal 2008. Therefore, we have provided a $134 million valuation allowance for the portion of capital losses we do not expect to utilize, of which $81 million was recorded as an increase in other comprehensive loss in fiscal 2008. We can only use net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in certain tax jurisdictions. Based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities, we expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal 2008. Therefore, we have provided a $15 million valuation allowance for these net operating losses. Significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future capital gains, the timing of realization of capital losses and the amount of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses, capital gains and taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made. We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be invested indefinitely outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. No provision has been made for United States federal and state, or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries, the cumulative amount of which is approximately $6.8 billion as of September 28, 2008. Should we repatriate foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period in which the decision to repatriate earnings of foreign subsidiaries is made. 49 Table of Contents We recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders’ equity only when realized. Accordingly, deferred tax assets are not recognized for net operating loss carryforwards resulting from windfall tax benefits. A windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee’s disposition of a share-based award exceeds the deferred tax asset, if any, associated with the award that we had recorded. When assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share-based compensation has been realized, we follow the tax law ordering method, under which current year share-based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. Litigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions. We estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Other than amounts relating to the Broadcom Corporation v. QUALCOMM Incorporated matters, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with any other legal proceedings based on our belief that additional liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be estimated at this time. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2008 were $11.14 billion, compared to $8.87 billion for fiscal 2007. Revenues from two customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI segments (each of whom accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the period) comprised approximately 30% and 27% in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2008 were $7.16 billion, compared to $5.77 billion for fiscal 2007. Revenues from sales of integrated circuit products increased $1.41 billion, resulting primarily from an increase of $1.23 billion related to higher unit shipments, mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, and an increase of $219 million related to the net effects of changes in product mix and the average sales prices of such products. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2008 were $3.98 billion, compared to $3.11 billion for fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues from licensing and royalty fees primarily related to an increase in sales of CDMA-based products reported by QTL’s licensees other than Nokia, driven by the continued adoption of WCDMA at higher average selling prices than CDMA and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal 2008 included $560 million (attributable to both fiscal 2008 and 2007) related to the new agreements with Nokia. Revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal 2007 included royalty payments from Nokia only for sales of Nokia products through April 9, 2007. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2008 was $3.41 billion compared to $2.68 billion for fiscal 2007. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 48% for fiscal 2008, compared to 47% for fiscal 2007. Cost of equipment and services revenues included $39 million in share-based compensation in both fiscal 2008 and 2007. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2008, research and development expenses were $2.28 billion or 20% of revenues, compared to $1.83 billion or 21% of revenues for fiscal 2007. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $358 million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower cost devices, the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third party operating systems and services platforms. The technologies supporting these initiatives may include CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO Revision B, WCDMA, HSDPA, HSUPA, HSPA+ and OFDMA. Research and development expenses related to the development of our FLO technology, MediaFLO MDS, IMOD display products using MEMS technology, BREW products and mobile commerce applications increased by $63 million. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2008 included share-based compensation and in-process research and development of $250 million and $14 million, respectively, compared to $221 million and $10 million, respectively, in fiscal 2007. 50 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2008, selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.71 billion or 15% of revenues, compared to $1.48 billion or 17% of revenues for fiscal 2007. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $137 million increase in employee-related expenses and a $72 million increase in certain professional fees, primarily related to patent activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 included share-based compensation of $254 million, compared to $233 million in fiscal 2007. Net Investment Income. Net investment income was $96 million for fiscal 2008, compared to $743 million for fiscal 2007. The net decrease was primarily comprised as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 28,2008 September 30,2007 Change Interest and dividend income: Corporate and other segments $ 487 $ 551 $ (64 ) QSI 4 7 (3 ) Interest expense (22 ) (11 ) (11 ) Net realized gains on investments: Corporate and other segments 104 201 (97 ) QSI 51 21 30 Other-than-temporary losses on investments: Corporate and other segments (502 ) (16 ) (486 ) QSI (33 ) (11 ) (22 ) Gains on derivative instruments 6 2 4 Equity in earnings (losses) of investees 1 (1 ) 2 $ 96 $ 743 $ (647 ) The decrease in interest and dividend income on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by corporate and other segments was primarily a result of lower interest rates earned on interest-bearing securities. Other-than-temporary losses in fiscal 2008 included $327 million recognized in the fourth quarter on marketable securities held by corporate and other segments. Both other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities and the decrease in net realized gains on corporate investments were generally related to depressed securities values caused by a major disruption in U.S. and foreign credit and financial markets affecting consumers and the banking, finance and housing industries. This disruption is evidenced by a deterioration of confidence in financial markets and a severe decline in the availability of capital and demand for debt and equity securities. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $666 million for fiscal 2008, compared to $323 million for fiscal 2007. The annual effective tax rate was 17% for fiscal 2008, compared to 9% for fiscal 2007. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is higher than the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 primarily due to the impact of prior year audits completed during fiscal 2007. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is 18% lower than the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 22% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, and 1% related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by state taxes of approximately 4% and 1% related to an increase in the valuation allowance. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2007 were $8.87 billion, compared to $7.53 billion for fiscal 2006. Revenues from three customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI segments (each of whom accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the period) comprised approximately 41% and 39% in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2007 and 2006, respectively. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2007 were $5.77 billion, compared to $4.78 billion for fiscal 2006. Revenues from sales of integrated circuit products increased $922 million, resulting primarily from an increase of $761 million related to higher unit shipments, mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, and an increase of $144 million related to the net effects of changes in product mix and the average sales prices of such products. 51 Table of Contents Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2007 were $3.11 billion, compared to $2.75 billion for fiscal 2006. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees increased primarily as a result of a $306 million increase in QTL royalties related to an increase in our licensee’s sales of CDMA-based products driven by the continued adoption of WCDMA at higher average selling prices than CDMA, and a $30 million increase in QIS revenues primarily related to our expanded BREW customer base and products and a licensing agreement with Sprint. Worldwide demand for CDMA-based products has increased primarily as a result of the growth in sales of high-end WCDMA products and shifts in the geographic distribution of sales of CDMA2000 products. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2007 was $2.68 billion, compared to $2.18 billion for fiscal 2006. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 47% for fiscal 2007, compared to 46% for fiscal 2006. Cost of equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2007 included $39 million in share-based compensation, compared to $41 million in fiscal 2006. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2007, research and development expenses were $1.83 billion or 21% of revenues, compared to $1.54 billion or 20% of revenues for fiscal 2006. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $283 million increase in costs related to integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower cost devices, the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third party operating systems and services platforms. The technologies supporting these initiatives may include CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO Revision B, WCDMA, HSDPA, HSUPA and OFDMA. The increase in research and development expenses incurred also related to the development of our FLO technology, MediaFLO MDS and IMOD display products using MEMS technology. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2007 included share-based compensation and in-process research and development of $221 million and $10 million, respectively, compared to $216 million and $22 million, respectively, in fiscal 2006. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2007, selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.48 billion or 17% of revenues, compared to $1.12 billion or 15% of revenues for fiscal 2006. The dollar and percentage increases were primarily attributable to a $152 million increase in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, a $98 million increase in employee related expenses, a $40 million increase in other professional fees, a $39 million increase in bad debt expense, a $32 million increase in cooperative and other marketing expenses and a $28 million increase in depreciation and amortization, partially offset by a $44 million gain on the sale of a building. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2007 included share-based compensation of $233 million, compared to $238 million in fiscal 2006. Net Investment Income. Net investment income was $743 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $466 million for fiscal 2006. The net increase was primarily comprised as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 30,2007 September 24,2006 Change Interest and dividend income: Corporate and other segments $ 551 $ 410 $ 141 QSI 7 6 1 Interest expense (11 ) (4 ) (7 ) Net realized gains on investments: Corporate and other segments 201 106 95 QSI 21 30 (9 ) Other-than-temporary losses on investments (27 ) (24 ) (3 ) Gains (losses) on derivative instruments 2 (29 ) 31 Equity in losses of investees (1 ) (29 ) 28 $ 743 $ 466 $ 277 The increase in interest and dividend income on cash and marketable securities held by corporate and other segments was a result of higher average cash and marketable securities balances and higher interest rates on interest-bearing securities. Net realized gains on corporate investments increased primarily due to strength in the equity markets and reallocation of certain portfolio assets. 52 Table of Contents Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $323 million for fiscal 2007, compared to $686 million for fiscal 2006. The annual effective tax rate was 9% for fiscal 2007, compared to 22% for fiscal 2006. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 is lower than the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 primarily due to the impact of prior year audits completed during fiscal 2007 and additional foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal statutory tax rate. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 is 26% lower than the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 20% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, 9% related to the impact of the tax audits completed during the year and 2% related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by state taxes of approximately 5%. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 The following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2008 and 2007 financial results for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 9 – Segment Information.” QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2008 were $6.72 billion, compared to $5.28 billion for fiscal 2007. Equipment and services revenues, mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, were $6.53 billion for fiscal 2008, compared to $5.12 billion for fiscal 2007. The increase in equipment and services revenues resulted primarily from an increase of $1.23 billion related to higher unit shipments and an increase of $219 million related to the net effects of changes in product mix and the average sales prices of such products. Approximately 336 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2008, compared to approximately 253 million for fiscal 2007. QCT’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2008 were $1.83 billion, compared to $1.55 billion for fiscal 2007. QCT’s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage) was 27% in fiscal 2008, compared to 29% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in operating margin percentage was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin percentage related to an increase in reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and product support costs. QCT inventories increased by 17% in fiscal 2008 from $387 million to $453 million primarily due to the shift in our manufacturing business model from turnkey to IFM and the related work-in process which includes purchased die and related back-end assembly and test manufacturing services needed to complete QCT’s integrated circuit products. The increase is also attributable to an increase in finished goods associated with growth in sales volume. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2008 were $3.62 billion, compared to $2.77 billion for fiscal 2007. QTL’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2008 were $3.14 billion, compared to $2.34 billion for fiscal 2007. QTL’s operating margin percentage was 87% in fiscal 2008, compared to 84% in fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues from licensing and royalty fees primarily related to an increase in sales of CDMA-based products reported by QTL’s licensees other than Nokia, driven by the continued adoption of WCDMA at higher average selling prices than CDMA and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, QTL revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal 2008 included $560 million (attributable to both fiscal 2008 and 2007) related to the new agreement with Nokia. Revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal 2007 included royalty payments from Nokia only for sales of Nokia products through April 9, 2007. The increase in earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues and the effect of bad debt expenses recognized in fiscal 2007, partially offset by increases in research and development expenses and patent costs, which resulted in a corresponding increase in operating margin percentage. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2008 were $785 million, compared to $828 million for fiscal 2007. Revenues decreased primarily due to a $78 million decrease in QES revenues, partially offset by a $27 million increase in QIS revenues. The decrease in QES revenues was primarily attributable to an $88 million decrease in revenues from product sales, partially offset by an $11 million increase in messaging revenues. QES shipped approximately 91,200 terrestrial-based and satellite-based systems during fiscal 2008, compared to approximately 190,300 terrestrial-based and satellite-based systems in fiscal 2007. The increase in QIS revenues was primarily attributable to increases in QChat revenues resulting from increased development efforts under a licensing agreement with Sprint and our expanded BREW customer base and products. QWI’s loss before taxes for fiscal 2008 was $1 million, compared to earnings before taxes of $88 million for fiscal 2007. QWI’s operating margin percentage was zero percent in fiscal 2008, compared to 11% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in QWI’s earnings before taxes was primarily due to the decrease in revenues, a $30 million increase in QIS research and development expenses related to our BREW products and a $34 million increase in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of Firethorn during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, all of which contributed to a corresponding decline in operating margin percentage. 53 Table of Contents QSI Segment. QSI revenues for fiscal 2008 were $12 million, compared to $1 million for fiscal 2007, related to the commencement of our MediaFLO service in March 2007. QSI’s loss before taxes for fiscal 2008 was $304 million, compared to $240 million for fiscal 2007. QSI’s loss before taxes also included a $71 million increase in our MediaFLO USA subsidiary’s loss before taxes comprised primarily of an increase of $50 million in cost of equipment and services revenues and a $22 million increase in research and development expenses. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results of fiscal 2007 and 2006 for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9 – Segment Information.” QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2007 were $5.28 billion, compared to $4.33 billion for fiscal 2006. Equipment and services revenues, mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, were $5.12 billion for fiscal 2007, compared to $4.20 billion for fiscal 2006. The increase in equipment and services revenue resulted primarily from an increase of $761 million related to higher unit shipments and an increase of $144 million related to the net effects of changes in product mix and the average sales prices of such products. Approximately 253 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2007, compared to approximately 207 million for fiscal 2006. QCT’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2007 were $1.55 billion, compared to $1.30 billion for fiscal 2006. QCT’s operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage) was 29% in fiscal 2007, compared to 30% in fiscal 2006. The decrease in operating margin percentage was primarily due to increases in research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in the gross margin percentage. QCT inventories increased by 116% in fiscal 2007 from $179 million to $387 million due to increased purchases of completed die directly from foundry suppliers for use in QCT’s CDMA-based integrated circuit products in connection with the shift in our manufacturing business model from turnkey to IFM. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2007 were $2.77 billion, compared to $2.47 billion for fiscal 2006. QTL’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2007 were $2.34 billion, compared to $2.23 billion for fiscal 2006. QTL’s operating margin percentage was 84% in fiscal 2007, compared to 90% in fiscal 2006. The increase in revenues primarily resulted from a $306 million increase in royalties, driven by an increase in sales of CDMA-based products by licensees. The increase in earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues, partially offset by increases in legal and bad debt expenses, which resulted in a corresponding decline in operating margin percentage. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2007 were $828 million, compared to $731 million for fiscal 2006. Revenues increased primarily due to increases of $78 million and $11 million in QIS and QES revenues, respectively. The increase in QIS revenues is primarily attributable to a $61 million increase in QChat revenues resulting from increased development efforts under a licensing agreement with Sprint and an $18 million increase in fees related to our expanded BREW customer base and products. The increase in QES revenues is primarily attributable to a $26 million increase in equipment and messaging revenues, partially offset by a $15 million decrease in amortization of deferred revenues related to historical equipment sales. QES shipped approximately 190,300 terrestrial-based and satellite-based systems during fiscal 2007, compared to approximately 140,300 terrestrial-based and satellite-based systems in fiscal 2006. QWI’s earnings before taxes for fiscal 2007 were $88 million, compared to $78 million for fiscal 2006. QWI’s operating margin percentage was 11% in fiscal 2007, compared to 10% in fiscal 2006. The increase in QWI’s earnings before taxes was primarily due to a $54 million increase in QIS gross margin, largely resulting from our expanded BREW customer base and products and QChat development efforts, partially offset by a $29 million increase in QWI selling, general and administrative expenses and an $18 million decrease in QES gross margin. The increase in QWI’s operating margin percentage was primarily attributable to the increase in QIS gross margin, partially offset by the decrease in QES gross margin. QSI Segment. QSI’s loss before taxes for fiscal 2007 was $240 million, compared to $133 million for fiscal 2006. QSI’s loss before taxes included a $118 million increase in our MediaFLO USA subsidiary’s loss before taxes comprised primarily of $70 million in cost of services revenues related to the commencement of our MediaFLO service in March 2007 and a $42 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses, including $20 million related to cooperative marketing expenses. During fiscal 2006, QSI recorded $30 million in equity in losses of investees resulting primarily from the effect of investment losses recognized by Inquam and a venture fund investee in fiscal 2006, of which our share was $20 million and $11 million, respectively. Equity in losses of investees was negligible during fiscal 2007. 54 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $11.3 billion at September 28, 2008, a decrease of $546 million from September 30, 2007. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 28, 2008 consisted of $6.8 billion held by foreign subsidiaries with the remaining balance of $4.5 billion held domestically. Due to tax considerations, we derive liquidity for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and investments held domestically. Total cash provided by operating activities was $3.6 billion during fiscal 2008, compared to $3.8 billion during fiscal 2007. Net proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans was $1.2 billion during fiscal 2008, compared to $556 million during fiscal 2007. On March 11, 2008, we announced that we had been authorized to repurchase up to $2.0 billion of our common stock. The $2.0 billion stock repurchase program replaced a $3.0 billion stock repurchase program, of which approximately $2 million remained authorized for repurchases. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. During fiscal 2008, we repurchased and retired 42,616,000 shares of our common stock for $1.7 billion. At September 28, 2008, we had not repurchased any of our shares under the $2.0 billion stock repurchase program. We declared and paid dividends totaling $982 million, $862 million and $698 million, or $0.60, $0.52 and $0.42 per common share, during fiscal 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. On October 22, 2008, we announced a cash dividend of $0.16 per share on our common stock, payable on January 7, 2009 to stockholders of record as of December 11, 2008. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. Since September 2007, there has been a major disruption in U.S. and foreign credit and financial markets affecting consumers and the banking, finance and housing industries. This disruption was evidenced by a deterioration of confidence in financial markets and a severe decline in the availability of capital and demand for debt and equity securities. At September 28, 2008 and October 31, 2008, gross unrealized gains on marketable securities were $102 million and approximately $75 million, respectively, and gross unrealized losses were $449 million and approximately $1.3 billion, respectively. Our analyses of the severity and duration of price declines, market research, industry reports, economic forecasts and the specific circumstances of issuers indicate that it is reasonable to expect marketable securities with unrealized losses to recover within a reasonable period of time. Further, we have the ability and the intent to hold such securities until they recover. As a result, we do not believe the decline in the fair value of our marketable securities portfolio will materially affect our liquidity. At September 28, 2008, we classified our auction rate securities with recorded values of $186 million as noncurrent assets due to a disruption in credit markets that caused the auction mechanism to fail to set market-clearing rates and provide liquidity for sellers. However, a failed auction does not represent a default by the issuer of the underlying security. Our auction rate securities are predominantly rated AAA/Aaa, are collateralized by student loans substantially guaranteed by the U.S. government and continue to pay interest in accordance with their contractual terms. The cash values of our auction rate securities, which are held by a foreign subsidiary, may not be accessible until a successful auction occurs, a buyer is found outside of the auction process, the securities are called by the issuer or the underlying securities have been prepaid or have matured. Due to the combined strength of our significant cash, short-term investments and operating cash flows, we do not anticipate the current illiquidity of auction rate securities to affect our operating plans. Accounts receivable increased greater than 100% during fiscal 2008 primarily due to a $2.5 billion trade receivable for which we received payment in October 2008 related to the new agreements with Nokia, an increase of $423 million in other trade accounts receivable and an increase of $400 million related to amounts receivable for redemptions of money market funds for which we received partial payment in October 2008. Days sales outstanding related to other trade accounts receivable were 30 days at September 28, 2008 compared to 27 days at September 30, 2007. The increase in other trade accounts receivable and the related days sales outstanding were primarily due to increased revenues for integrated circuits and the timing of cash receipts for related receivables. 55 Table of Contents We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and our expected cash flow generated from operations will provide us with flexibility and satisfy our working and other capital requirements over the next fiscal year and beyond based on our current business plans. Our total research and development expenditures were $2.28 billion in fiscal 2008 and $1.83 billion in fiscal 2007, and we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development for new technologies, applications and services for the wireless industry. Our purchase obligations for fiscal 2009, some of which relate to research and development activities, totaled $868 million, at September 28, 2008. Cash used for strategic investments and acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $298 million in fiscal 2008 and $249 million in fiscal 2007, and we expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions to open new markets for our technology, expand our technology, obtain development resources, grow our patent portfolio or pursue new business opportunities. Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in S-K 303(a)(4)(ii). At September 28, 2008, our outstanding contractual obligations included (in millions): Contractual Obligations Payments Due By Fiscal Period No Expiration Total 2009 2010-2011 2012-2013 Beyond 2013 Date Purchase obligations (1) $ 1,187 $ 868 $ 179 $ 85 $ 55 $ — Operating leases 453 85 116 51 201 — Equity funding commitments (2) 9 — — — — 9 Total commitments 1,649 953 295 136 256 9 Capital leases (3) 322 10 20 20 272 — Other long-term liabilities (4)(5) 46 — 38 1 6 1 Total recorded liabilities 368 10 58 21 278 1 Total $ 2,017 $ 963 $ 353 $ 157 $ 534 $ 10 (1) Total purchase obligations include $678 million in commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories. (2) These commitments do not have fixed funding dates and are subject to certain conditions. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed or funded under these arrangements; actual financing or funding may be in lesser amounts or not at all. (3) Amounts represent future minimum lease payments including interest payments. Capital lease obligations are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at September 28, 2008. (4) Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenues and the obligation under securities lending, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. (5) Our consolidated balance sheet at September 28, 2008 included a $227 million noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions, of which $138 million may result in cash payment. The future payments related to uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities. Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 28, 2008 is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8 – Commitments and Contingencies.” Future Accounting Requirements In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement No. 157 (FAS 157), “Fair Value Measurements,” which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements. FAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements, but applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-2 (FSP 157-2) which delays the effective date of FAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal 2010. In October 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157-3 (FSP 157-3) which clarifies the application of FAS 157 in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. The accounting provisions of FAS 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities will be effective for our fiscal 2009 beginning September 29, 2008. The adoption of FAS 157 for financial assets and financial liabilities is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, and we are in the process of determining the effect such adoption will have on our financial statement disclosures. We are also in the process of assessing the effects, if any, the adoption of FAS 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities will have on our consolidated financial statements. 56 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement No. 159 (FAS 159), “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities—Including an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 115,” which provides companies the irrevocable option to measure many financial assets and liabilities at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in earnings (the fair value option) resulting in an opportunity to mitigate volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. The accounting provisions of FAS 159 will be effective for our fiscal 2009 beginning September 29, 2008. We are still in the process of determining whether we will apply the fair value option to any of our financial assets. If we do elect the fair value option, the cumulative effect of initially adoption FAS 159 will be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption and will be presented separately. In December 2007, the FASB revised Statement No. 141 (FAS 141R), “Business Combinations,” which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination (i) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, (ii) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and (iii) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. FAS 141R will be effective for our fiscal 2010 beginning September 28, 2009. We are in the process of determining the effects, if any, the adoption of FAS 141R will have on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued Statement No. 161 (FAS 161), “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133,” which requires additional disclosures about the objectives of using derivative instruments, the method by which the derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under FASB Statement No.133 and its related interpretations, and the effect of derivative instruments and related hedged items on financial position, financial performance and cash flows. FAS 161 also requires disclosure of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format. FAS 161 will be effective for our second quarter of fiscal 2009 beginning December 29, 2008. We are in the process of determining the effects the adoption of FAS 161 will have on our financial statement disclosures. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Credit Risk. Since September 2007, there has been a major disruption in U.S. and foreign credit and financial markets affecting consumers and the banking, finance and housing industries. This disruption is evidenced by a deterioration of confidence in financial markets and a severe decline in the availability of capital and demand for debt and equity securities. The result has been depressed security values and widening credit spreads in most types of investment- and non-investment-grade bonds and debt obligations and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. We have no direct investments in the lowest credit quality, or subprime, mortgages, nor do we have investments collateralized by assets that include subprime mortgages. We have indirect exposure to subprime mortgages to the extent of our investments in large, diversified financial companies, commercial banks, insurance companies and public/private investment funds that participate or invest in subprime mortgage loans, mortgage insurance or loan servicing, which could impact the fair values of our securities. At September 28, 2008, we held a significant portion of our corporate cash in diversified portfolios of fixed- and floating-rate, investment-grade marketable securities, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, non-investment-grade bank loans and bonds, preferred stocks, equities and other securities that have been affected by these credit market concerns and had temporary gross unrealized losses of $449 million. At October 31, 2008, gross unrealized losses of our marketable securities portfolio were approximately $1.3 billion. Although we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary, there is a risk that we may incur other-than-temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these and other similarly affected securities if U.S. credit and equity markets do not stabilize and recover to previous levels in the coming quarters. We engage in transactions in which certain fixed-income and equity securities are loaned to selected broker-dealers. We may incur a loss in the event that a broker does not return our securities, the collateral value is insufficient or cannot be maintained at required values or the lending agent fails to restore or pay us the cash value of our loaned securities. Interest Rate Risk. We invest our cash in a number of diversified investment- and non-investment-grade fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and debt mutual funds. Changes in the general level of United States interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed interest-bearing securities. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed interest-bearing securities could lose value. When the general economy weakens significantly, as it has recently, the credit profile, financial strength and growth prospects of certain issuers of interest-bearing securities held in our investment portfolios may deteriorate, and our interest-bearing securities may lose value either temporarily or other than temporarily. We may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs that do not perform well. 57 Table of Contents The following table provides information about our interest-bearing securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows, weighted-average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes. Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal Amount by Expected Maturity Average Interest Rates (Dollars in millions) No Single 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Maturity Total Fixed interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 758 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 758 Interest rate 3.1 % Available-for-sale securities: Investment grade $ 1,562 $ 314 $ 279 $ 95 $ 39 $ 130 $ 198 $ 2,617 Interest rate 3.4 % 3.9 % 3.9 % 4.0 % 5.2 % 8.7 % 5.0 % Non-investment grade $ 42 $ 13 $ 41 $ 67 $ 84 $ 521 $ — $ 768 Interest rate 8.1 % 7.5 % 9.7 % 7.8 % 8.0 % 9.3 % Floating interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 903 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 903 Interest rate 2.0 % Available-for-sale securities: Investment grade $ 588 $ 711 $ 114 $ 68 $ — $ 87 $ 574 $ 2,142 Interest rate 2.9 % 3.0 % 3.1 % 3.1 % 5.2 % 4.5 % Non-investment grade $ 13 $ 26 $ 57 $ 99 $ 136 $ 270 $ 684 $ 1,285 Interest rate 4.5 % 6.8 % 7.4 % 7.1 % 7.2 % 7.5 % 7.1 % Cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Equity Price Risk. The recent major disruption in U.S. and foreign credit and financial markets caused increased volatility in the fair values of our equity securities and equity mutual and exchange-traded fund shares. We have a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equities held by mutual and exchange-traded fund shares that are subject to equity price risk. The recorded values of marketable equity securities decreased to $1.34 billion at September 28, 2008 from $1.52 billion at September 30, 2007. The recorded values of equity mutual fund and exchange-traded fund shares decreased to $1.28 billion at September 28, 2008 from $1.87 billion at September 30, 2007. The combined recorded values of marketable equity securities and equity mutual and exchange-traded fund shares decreased by approximately $725 million due to price declines and by approximately $48 million as a result of actions taken to reduce our exposure to equity investments. We have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size, style, industry and geography, and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund and exchange-traded fund shares at September 28, 2008 would cause a corresponding 10% decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities, or $262 million. At October 31, 2008, gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund and exchange-traded fund shares were approximately $786 million. Foreign Exchange Risk. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, consisting primarily of foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties. Such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. At September 28, 2008, we had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding. At September 28, 2008, we had a net asset of $37 million related to our foreign currency option contracts that hedge the foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of CDMA and WCDMA products. In the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle transactions, which could materially impact our results. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in each of our hedged foreign currencies, we would incur a loss of approximately $8 million resulting from a decrease in fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 – The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies. 58 Table of Contents Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies. Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks.",2023-12-30 18:21:38.996347
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Recent Developments Revenues for fiscal 2009 were $10.4 billion, with net income of $1.6 billion, which were impacted by the following key items: • Both revenues and net income were adversely impacted by lower demand for CDMA-based MSM integrated circuits during the first half of fiscal 2009 as a result of the slowdown in the global economy. We shipped approximately 317 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) integrated circuits for CDMA-based wireless devices, a decrease of 6%, compared to approximately 336 million MSM integrated circuits in fiscal 2008. In addition, net income was adversely impacted by other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities related primarily to the volatility in global financial markets. • CDMA-based device shipments totaled approximately 492 million units, an increase of 14% over the 433 million units shipped in fiscal 2008. (2) • The average selling price of CDMA-based devices was estimated to be approximately $200, a decrease of approximately 9% from the prior year. (2) • We entered into a Settlement and Patent License and Non-Assert Agreement with Broadcom Corporation. As a result of this agreement, we recorded a $783 million charge. • In July 2009, the Korea Fair Trade Commission (KFTC) announced (although a written decision has not yet been issued) that it found us to be in violation of South Korean law by offering certain discounts and rebates for purchases of our CDMA chips and that it would levy a fine, as well as order us to cease the practices at issue. We intend to appeal the written decision once issued. As a result of this announcement, we recorded a $230 million charge. Against this backdrop, the following recent developments occurred during fiscal 2009 with respect to key elements of our business or our industry: • Worldwide wireless subscribers grew by approximately 16% to reach approximately 4.5 billion.(1) • CDMA subscribers, including both 2G (cdmaOne) and 3G (CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, WCDMA, HSPA and TD-SCDMA), are approximately 20% of total worldwide wireless subscribers to date. (1) • 3G subscribers (all CDMA-based) grew to approximately 885 million worldwide including approximately 455 million CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO subscribers and approximately 430 million WCDMA/HSPA/TD-SCDMA subscribers. (1) • In the handset market, CDMA-based unit shipments grew an estimated 7% year-over-year, compared to an estimated decline of 7% year-over-year across all technologies. (3) • In September 2009, the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) issued a Cease and Desist Order (CDO) seeking to require us to modify our existing license agreements with Japanese companies to eliminate certain cross-license non-assertion provisions in our license agreements, while preserving the license of our patents to those companies. We intend to invoke our right under Japanese law to an administrative hearing before the JFTC and to seek a stay of the CDO from the JFTC, and if necessary, from the Japanese courts. (1) According to Wireless Intelligence estimates as of November 2, 2009, for the quarter ending September 30, 2009. Wireless Intelligence estimates for CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO subscribers do not include Wireless Local Loop. (2) Derived from reports provided by our licensees/manufacturers during the year and our own estimates of unreported activity. (3) Based on current reports by Strategy Analytics, a global research and consulting firm, in their Global Handset Market Share Updates. Our Business and Operating Segments We design, manufacture, have manufactured on our behalf and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our CDMA technology and other technologies. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products, license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property, messaging and 42 Table of Contents other services and related hardware sales, software development and licensing and related services, software hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content. Operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments. These segments are: Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, or QCT; Qualcomm Technology Licensing, or QTL; Qualcomm Wireless & Internet, or QWI; and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives, or QSI. QCT is a leading developer and supplier of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning system products. QCT’s integrated circuit products and system software are used in wireless devices, particularly mobile phones, laptops, data modules, handheld wireless computers, data cards and infrastructure equipment. The integrated circuits for wireless devices include the Mobile Station Modem (MSM), Radio Frequency (RF) and Power Management (PM) devices. These integrated circuits for wireless devices and system software perform voice and data communication, multimedia and global positioning functions, radio conversion between RF and baseband signals and power management. QCT’s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling equipment manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. The infrastructure equipment integrated circuits and system software perform the core baseband CDMA modem functionality in the wireless operator’s base station equipment. QCT revenues comprised 59%, 60% and 59% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the assembly and final test manufacturing processes. We rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing business models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing business model, we purchase die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party manufacturers for back-end assembly and test services. We refer to this two-stage manufacturing business model as Integrated Fabless Manufacturing (IFM). QTL grants licenses to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD (including TD-SCDMA), GSM/GPRS/EDGE and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives. QTL receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Ongoing royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale selling price of licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g., certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.). QTL revenues comprised 35%, 33% and 31% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues have been generated through our licensees’ sales of cdmaOne, CDMA2000 and WCDMA products. QWI, which includes Qualcomm Enterprise Services (QES), Qualcomm Internet Services (QIS), Qualcomm Government Technologies (QGOV) and Firethorn, generates revenues primarily through mobile information products and services, software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications. QES sells equipment, software and services used by transportation and other companies to connect wirelessly with their assets and workforce. Through September 2009, QES has shipped approximately 1,344,000 terrestrial-based and satellite-based mobile information units. QIS provides content enablement services for the wireless industry, including BREW (Binary Runtime Environment for Wireless), the Plaza suite and other services. QIS also provides QChat push-to-talk, QPoint and other products for wireless network operators. The QGOV division provides development, hardware and analytical expertise involving wireless communications technologies to United States government agencies. Firethorn builds and manages software applications that enable financial institutions and wireless operators to offer mobile commerce services. QWI revenues comprised 6%, 7% and 9% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. QSI manages the Company’s strategic investment activities, including FLO TV Incorporated (FLO TV), formerly MediaFLO USA, Inc., our wholly-owned wireless multimedia operator subsidiary. QSI also makes strategic investments to promote the worldwide adoption of CDMA-based products and services. Our strategy is to invest in early-stage and other companies, including licensed device manufacturers, that we believe open new markets for CDMA technology, support the design and introduction of new CDMA-based products or possess 43 Table of Contents unique capabilities or technology. Our FLO TV subsidiary offers its service over our nationwide multicasting network based on our MediaFLO Media Distribution System (MDS) and MediaFLO technology. This network is utilized as a shared resource for wireless operators and their customers in the United States. The commercial availability of the FLO TV service to retail wireless consumers continues to be determined, in part, by our wireless operator partners. FLO TV’s network uses the 700 MHz spectrum for which we hold licenses nationwide. Additionally, FLO TV has and will continue to procure, aggregate and distribute content in service packages which we will continue to make available on a wholesale basis to our wireless operator customers (whether they operate on CDMA, WCDMA or GSM networks) in the United States. Distribution, marketing, billing and customer care remain functions that are provided primarily by our wireless operator partners. As part of our strategic investment activities, we intend to pursue various exit strategies at some point in the future, which may include distribution of our ownership interest in FLO TV to our stockholders in a spin-off transaction. Nonreportable segments include: the Qualcomm MEMS Technologies division, which is developing an interferometric modulator (IMOD) display technology based on micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) structure combined with thin film optics; the Qualcomm Flarion Technologies division, which is developing femtocell chipset products and other OFDM/OFDMA technologies; the MediaFLO Technologies division, which is developing our MediaFLO MDS and MediaFLO technology and markets MediaFLO for deployment outside of the United States; and other product initiatives. Looking Forward The deployment of 3G networks enables increased voice capacity and higher data rates, thereby supporting more minutes of use and a range of mobile broadband data applications for handsets, 3G connected computing devices and other consumer electronics. Data applications include broadband connectivity, streaming video, location based services, mobile social networking and multimedia messaging. As a result, we expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for 3G products and services around the world. As we look forward to the next several months, the following items are likely to have an impact on our business: • The network launches and further expansion of 3G in China, including CDMA2000 by China Telecom, WCDMA by China Unicom and TD-SCDMA by China Mobile, is expected to drive competition and growth of 3G products and services in that region. • The transition to 3G CDMA-based networks is expected to continue: o More than 595 operators have commercially launched 3G networks, including 300 CDMA2000 networks and 295 WCDMA networks; (1)(2) o More than 110 CDMA2000 operators have commercially launched the higher data speeds of 1xEV-DO and more than 75 have launched EV-DO Revision A; (1) and o More than 280 WCDMA operators have commercially launched the higher data speeds of HSDPA, while more than 90 have launched HSUPA and 26 have launched HSPA+. (2) • We expect that CDMA-based device prices will continue to segment into high and low end due to high volumes and vibrant competition in marketplaces around the world. As operators deploy the higher data speeds of HSPA, HSPA+, EV-DO Revision A and EV-DO Revision B and as manufacturers introduce additional highly-featured, converged devices, we expect consumer demand for advanced 3G devices to continue at a strong pace. • To meet growing demand for advanced 3G wireless devices and increased multimedia functionality, we intend to continue to invest significant resources toward the development of wireless baseband chips, converged computing/communication chips, multimedia products, software and services for the wireless industry. We expect that a portion of our research and development initiatives in fiscal 2010 will not reach commercialization until several years in the future. • We expect demand for cost-effective wireless devices to continue to grow and have developed a family of Qualcomm Single Chip (QSC) products, which integrate the baseband, radio frequency and power management functions into a single chip or package, lowering component counts and enabling faster time-to-market for our customers. While we continue to invest aggressively to expand our QSC product family to address the low-end market more effectively with CDMA-based products, we still face significant competition from GSM-based products, particularly in emerging markets. • We expect to continue to invest in the evolution of CDMA and a broad range of other technologies as part of our vision to enable a range of technologies, including the following products and technologies: 44 Table of Contents o The continued evolution of CDMA-based technologies, including the long-term roadmaps of 1xEV-DO and High Speed Packet Access (HSPA); o OFDM and OFDMA-based technologies, including LTE; o Our service applications platform, content delivery services and user interfaces; o Our Snapdragon platform to help create new CDMA-based connected computing products and drive connectivity beyond traditional wireless devices; o Our Gobi mobile data modems to provide worldwide CDMA-based embedded connectivity for existing computing platforms; o Our convergence-based chips that include 3G modem and applications processor capabilities (including support for third-party operating systems); o Our FLO TV mobile television service which includes product and distribution expansion beyond wireless operators through direct-to-consumer products such as automotive devices and personal television devices through retail channels; and o Our IMOD display technology. In addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, the following items are likely to have an impact on our business and results of operations over the next several months: • We expect to continue to devote resources to working with and educating all participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless market. However, we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. We expect that such companies will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world. For example, we expect that we will continue to be involved in litigation, and to appear in front of administrative and regulatory bodies, including the European Commission, the Korea Fair Trade Commission and the Japan Fair Trade Commission, to defend our business model and to rebuff efforts by companies seeking to gain competitive advantage or negotiating leverage. • We have been and will continue evaluating and providing reasonable assistance to our customers. This includes, in some cases, certain levels of financial support to minimize the impact of litigation in which we or our customers may become involved. • The volatility in financial markets may continue to have an impact on the value of our marketable securities and net investment income (loss). (1) According to public reports made available at www.cdg.org as of October 27, 2009. (2) As reported by the Global mobile Suppliers Association, an international organization of WCDMA and GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) suppliers, in their October 2009 reports. Further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the Risk Factors included in this Annual Report. Revenue Concentrations Revenues from customers in South Korea, China and Japan comprised 35%, 23% and 11%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2009, as compared to 35%, 21% and 14%, respectively, for fiscal 2008, and 31%, 21% and 17%, respectively, for fiscal 2007. We distinguish revenues from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to which our products, software or services are delivered and, for QTL’s licensing and royalty revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees. The decline in revenues from customers in Japan was primarily due to lower replacement rates in Japan. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets and investments, share-based payments, income taxes and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions 45 Table of Contents that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others. Revenue Recognition. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, royalties and license fees for our intellectual property, messaging and other services and related hardware sales, software development and licensing and related services, software hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but actual results may differ from our estimates. We record reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special pricing agreements and other volume-related rebate programs. Such reductions to revenue are based on estimates, including our assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes, market share and inventory levels. We license rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit to the licensee, typically five to fifteen years. We earn royalties on such licensed products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees’ sales occur. Our licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter. We recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met. From time to time, licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal disputes, and when this occurs, the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected. Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. We also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions. As of September 27, 2009, our goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $1.5 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. For intangible assets purchased in a business combination or received in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets received (or, for non-monetary exchanges, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values, except when neither the values of the assets received or the assets transferred in non-monetary exchanges are determinable within reasonable limits. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. An estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions which require significant judgment. For example, the income approach generally requires assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows, total addressable market, pricing and share forecasts, competition, technology obsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of certain assets, or our conclusion that the value of certain assets is not reliably estimable, may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models. New information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our net investment income (loss). 46 Table of Contents We hold minority investments in publicly-traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile. We also hold investments in other marketable securities, including non-investment-grade debt securities, equity and debt mutual and exchange-traded funds, corporate bonds and notes, auction rate securities and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. These investments, which are recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally recorded through stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income or loss, totaled $15 billion at September 27, 2009. We record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. In addition, the fair values of our strategic investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring impairment charges. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been below its original cost, the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default or recovery rates of securities in an asset class, negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others, the performance and pricing of the investee’s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations, as applicable. We also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, we may record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded $743 million, $502 million and $16 million, respectively, in net other-than-temporary losses on our investments in marketable securities. Share-Based Payments. We grant options to purchase our common stock to our employees and directors under our equity compensation plans. Eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at 85% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each six-month offering period under our employee stock purchase plan. Share-based compensation expense recognized during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007 was $584 million, $543 million and $493 million, respectively. At September 27, 2009, total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non-vested stock options granted prior to that date was $1.4 billion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.3 years. Net stock options, after forfeitures and cancellations, granted during fiscal 2009 represented 2.2% of outstanding shares as of the beginning of the fiscal period. Total stock options granted during fiscal 2009 represented 2.5% of outstanding shares as of the end of the fiscal period. We estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using a lattice binomial option-pricing model (binomial model). The determination of the fair value of share-based payment awards on the date of grant using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rate and expected dividends. We believe it is important for investors to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option-pricing models to estimate share-based compensation. Option-pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions, are fully transferable and do not cause dilution. Because our share-based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options, and because valuation model assumptions are subjective, in our opinion, existing valuation models, including the Black-Scholes and lattice binomial models, may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share-based compensation awards. There is not currently a generally accepted market-based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models. Although we estimate the fair value of employee share-based awards, the option-pricing model we use may not produce a value that is indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer/willing seller market transaction. For purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2009, we used the implied volatility of market-traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the binomial model. We utilized the term structure of volatility up to approximately two years, and we used the implied volatility of the option with the longest time to maturity for the expected volatility estimates for periods beyond two years. The weighted-average volatility assumption was 42.7% for fiscal 2009, which if increased to 50%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2009 by $1.78 per share, or 11%. The authoritative guidance includes implied volatility in its list of factors that should be considered in estimating expected volatility. We believe implied volatility is more useful than historical volatility in estimating expected 47 Table of Contents volatility because it is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility. The risk-free interest rate is based on the yield curve of U.S. Treasury strip securities for a period consistent with the contractual life of the option in effect at the time of grant. The weighted-average risk-free interest rate assumption was 2.6% for fiscal 2009, which if increased to 6.0% would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2009 by $1.42 per share, or 8%. We do not target a specific dividend yield for our policy on dividend payments, but we are required to assume a dividend yield as an input to the binomial model. The dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts. The dividend yield assumption was 1.5% for fiscal 2009, which if decreased to 0.4% would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2009 by $1.14 per share, or 7%. Dividends and/or increases or decreases in dividend payments are subject to approval by our Board of Directors as well as to future cash inflows and outflows resulting from operating performance, stock repurchase programs, mergers and acquisitions, and other sources and uses of cash. While our historical dividend rate is assumed to continue in the future, it may be subject to substantial change, and investors should not depend upon this forecast as a reliable indication of future cash distributions that will be made to investors. The post-vesting forfeiture rate is estimated using historical option cancellation information. The weighted-average post-vesting forfeiture rate assumption was 9.2% for fiscal 2009, which if decreased to 1.5%, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2009 by $1.20 per share, or 7%. The suboptimal exercise factor is estimated using historical option exercise information. The weighted-average suboptimal exercise factor assumption was 1.9 for fiscal 2009, which if increased to 2.5, would increase the weighted-average estimated fair value of stock options granted during fiscal 2009 by $1.21 per share or 7%. Income Taxes. Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. For example, during fiscal 2009, we recorded an income tax benefit of $155 million, adjusting our prior year estimates of uncertain tax positions as a result of various federal, state and foreign tax audits. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. As of September 27, 2009, gross deferred tax assets were $1.5 billion. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results. As of September 27, 2009, we had gross deferred tax assets of $510 million related to capital losses and $23 million related to foreign and state net operating losses. We can only use realized capital losses to offset realized capital gains. Based upon our assessments of when capital gains and losses will be realized, we estimate that our future capital gains will not be sufficient to utilize all of the temporary and other-than-temporary capital losses that were recorded through fiscal 2009. During fiscal 2009, we decreased our valuation allowance for the portion of capital losses we do not expect to utilize by $79 million to $55 million. This decrease was comprised of a $278 million net decrease in valuation allowance as a result of an increase in net unrealized gains on marketable securities, which was recorded as an increase in other comprehensive income, partially offset by a $199 million net increase in valuation allowance related to other-than-temporary impairments on investments, which was recognized 48 Table of Contents in earnings. We can only use net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in certain tax jurisdictions. Based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities, we expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal 2009. Therefore, we have provided a $17 million valuation allowance for these net operating losses. Significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future capital gains, the timing of realization of capital losses and the amount of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of capital losses, capital gains and taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made. We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $3.0 billion related to the United States federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $8.6 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States. We recognize windfall tax benefits associated with the exercise of stock options directly to stockholders’ equity only when realized. A windfall tax benefit occurs when the actual tax benefit realized by us upon an employee’s disposition of a share-based award exceeds the deferred tax asset, if any, associated with the award that we had recorded. When assessing whether a tax benefit relating to share-based compensation has been realized, we follow the tax law ordering method, under which current year share-based compensation deductions are assumed to be utilized before net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes. Litigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions. We estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Other than amounts relating to the Korea Fair Trade Commission Complaint, we have not recorded any accrual for contingent liabilities associated with any other legal proceedings based on our belief that additional liabilities, while possible, are not probable. Further, any possible range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2009 were $10.42 billion, compared to $11.14 billion for fiscal 2008. Revenues from two customers of our QCT and QTL segments (each of whom accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the period) comprised approximately 31% and 30% in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2009 were $6.47 billion, compared to $7.16 billion for fiscal 2008. The decrease in revenues from sales of equipment and services was primarily due to a $597 million reduction in revenues from sales of integrated circuit products, mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, caused by the contraction in CDMA-based channel inventory, and a $79 million decrease in QES revenues. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2009 were $3.95 billion, compared to $3.98 billion for fiscal 2008. The decrease in revenues from licensing and royalty fees was primarily due to a $26 million decrease in BREW licensing revenues resulting from lower consumer demand and lower prices due to the slowdown in global economies and competitive pricing pressures. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2009 was $3.18 billion compared to $3.41 billion for fiscal 2008. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 49% for fiscal 2009, compared to 48% for fiscal 2008. Cost of equipment and services revenues included $41 million in share-based compensation in fiscal 2009, compared to $39 million in fiscal 2008. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues may fluctuate in future quarters depending on the mix of products sold and services provided, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors. 49 Table of Contents Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2009, research and development expenses were $2.44 billion or 23% of revenues, compared to $2.28 billion or 20% of revenues for fiscal 2008. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $129 million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower cost devices, the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third-party operating systems and services platforms. The technologies supporting these initiatives may include CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO Revision B, 1x Advanced, WCDMA, HSDPA, HSUPA, HSPA+ and LTE. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2009 included share-based compensation and in-process research and development of $280 million and $6 million, respectively, compared to $250 million and $14 million, respectively, in fiscal 2008. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2009, selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.56 billion or 15% of revenues, compared to $1.71 billion or 15% of revenues for fiscal 2008. The dollar decrease was primarily attributable to a $110 million decrease in professional fees, of which $72 million related to litigation and other legal matters, a $24 million decrease in selling and marketing expenses and a $19 million decrease in travel expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 included share-based compensation of $263 million, compared to $254 million in fiscal 2008. Net Investment (Loss) Income. Net investment loss was $150 million for fiscal 2009, compared to net investment income of $96 million for fiscal 2008. The net decrease was primarily comprised as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 27, September 28, 2009 2008 Change Interest and dividend income: Corporate and other segments $ 513 $ 487 $ 26 QSI 3 4 (1 ) Interest expense (24 ) (22 ) (2 ) Net realized gains on investments: Corporate and other segments 107 104 3 QSI 30 51 (21 ) Net impairment losses on investments: Corporate and other segments (734 ) (502 ) (232 ) QSI (29 ) (33 ) 4 Gains on derivative instruments 1 6 (5 ) Equity in (losses) earnings of investees (17 ) 1 (18 ) $ (150 ) $ 96 $ (246 ) Net other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities related primarily to depressed securities values caused by the prolonged disruption in global financial markets affecting consumers and the banking, finance and housing industries. This disruption is evidenced by a deterioration of confidence in financial markets and a severe decline in the availability of capital and demand for debt and equity securities. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $484 million for fiscal 2009, compared to $666 million for fiscal 2008. The annual effective tax rate was 23% for fiscal 2009, compared to 17% for fiscal 2008. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 is higher than the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 primarily due to a decrease in foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, an increase in the valuation allowance on capital losses recognized in earnings and the revaluation of net deferred tax assets to reflect changes in California law, partially offset by adjustments to prior year estimates of uncertain tax positions as a result of tax audits during fiscal 2009. 50 Table of Contents The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 of 23% is less than the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 20% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, 7% related to adjustments to prior year estimates of uncertain tax positions as a result of tax audits during the year and 5% related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance related to capital losses of 11%, the revaluation of net deferred items of 4% and state taxes of approximately 5%. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2008 were $11.14 billion, compared to $8.87 billion for fiscal 2007. Revenues from two customers of our QCT, QTL and QWI segments (each of whom accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the period) comprised approximately 30% and 27% in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2008 and 2007, respectively. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2008 were $7.16 billion, compared to $5.77 billion for fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues from sales of equipment and services was primarily due to a $1.41 billion increase in revenues from sales of integrated circuit products, mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2008 were $3.98 billion, compared to $3.11 billion for fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues from licensing and royalty fees primarily related to an increase in sales of CDMA-based products reported by QTL’s licensees other than Nokia, driven by the continued adoption of WCDMA at higher average selling prices than CDMA and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal 2008 included $560 million (attributable to both fiscal 2008 and 2007) related to agreements with Nokia. Revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal 2007 included royalty payments from Nokia only for sales of Nokia products through April 9, 2007. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2008 was $3.41 billion compared to $2.68 billion for fiscal 2007. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 48% for fiscal 2008, compared to 47% for fiscal 2007. Cost of equipment and services revenues included $39 million in share-based compensation in both fiscal 2008 and 2007. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2008, research and development expenses were $2.28 billion or 20% of revenues, compared to $1.83 billion or 21% of revenues for fiscal 2007. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $358 million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower cost devices, the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third-party operating systems and services platforms. The technologies supporting these initiatives may include CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO Revision B, WCDMA, HSDPA, HSUPA, HSPA+ and OFDMA. Research and development expenses related to the development of our MediaFLO technology, MediaFLO MDS, IMOD display products using MEMS technology, BREW products and mobile commerce applications increased by $63 million. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2008 included share-based compensation and in-process research and development of $250 million and $14 million, respectively, compared to $221 million and $10 million, respectively, in fiscal 2007. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2008, selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.71 billion or 15% of revenues, compared to $1.48 billion or 17% of revenues for fiscal 2007. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $137 million increase in employee-related expenses and a $72 million increase in certain professional fees, primarily related to patent activities. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2008 included share-based compensation of $254 million, compared to $233 million in fiscal 2007. Net Investment Income. Net investment income was $96 million for fiscal 2008, compared to $743 million for fiscal 2007. The net decrease was primarily comprised as follows (in millions): 51 Table of Contents Year Ended September 28, September 30, 2008 2007 Change Interest and dividend income: Corporate and other segments $ 487 $ 551 $ (64 ) QSI 4 7 (3 ) Interest expense (22 ) (11 ) (11 ) Net realized gains on investments: Corporate and other segments 104 201 (97 ) QSI 51 21 30 Net impairment losses on investments: Corporate and other segments (502 ) (16 ) (486 ) QSI (33 ) (11 ) (22 ) Gains on derivative instruments 6 2 4 Equity in earnings (losses) of investees 1 (1 ) 2 $ 96 $ 743 $ (647 ) The decrease in interest and dividend income on cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by corporate and other segments was primarily a result of lower interest rates earned on interest-bearing securities. Other-than-temporary losses in fiscal 2008 included $327 million recognized in the fourth quarter on marketable securities held by corporate and other segments. Both other-than-temporary losses on marketable securities and the decrease in net realized gains on corporate investments were generally related to depressed securities values caused by the major disruption in global financial markets. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $666 million for fiscal 2008, compared to $323 million for fiscal 2007. The annual effective tax rate was 17% for fiscal 2008, compared to 9% for fiscal 2007. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is higher than the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 primarily due to the impact of prior year audits completed during fiscal 2007. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is 18% lower than the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 22% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, and 1% related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by state taxes of approximately 4% and 1% related to an increase in the valuation allowance. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 The following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2009 and 2008 financial results for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements — Note 10 — Segment Information.” QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2009 were $6.14 billion, compared to $6.72 billion for fiscal 2008. Equipment and services revenues, mostly related to sales of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, were $5.93 billion for fiscal 2009, compared to $6.53 billion for fiscal 2008. The decrease in equipment and services revenues resulted primarily from a $770 million decrease related to lower unit shipments, caused by the contraction in CDMA-based channel inventory. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $113 million related to the net effects of changes in product mix and the average selling prices of such products. Approximately 317 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2009, compared to approximately 336 million for fiscal 2008. QCT earnings before taxes for fiscal 2009 were $1.44 billion, compared to $1.83 billion for fiscal 2008. QCT operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage) was 23% in fiscal 2009, compared to 27% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating margin percentage was primarily due to increased research and development expenses while revenues declined. QCT inventories decreased by 10% in fiscal 2009 from $453 million to $408 million primarily due to the net effects of changes in integrated circuit product mix and a decrease in average unit costs. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2009 were $3.61 billion, compared to $3.62 billion for fiscal 2008. QTL earnings before taxes for fiscal 2009 were $3.07 billion, compared to $3.14 billion for fiscal 2008. QTL operating margin percentage was 85% in fiscal 2009, compared to 87% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to an increase in amortization related to acquired patents, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees related to litigation and other legal matters, which resulted in a corresponding decline in operating margin percentage. 52 Table of Contents QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2009 were $641 million, compared to $785 million for fiscal 2008. Revenues decreased primarily due to a $79 million decrease in QES revenues and a $71 million decrease in QIS revenues. The decrease in QES revenues was primarily attributable to a $50 million decrease in revenues from hardware product sales, due to a 47,500-unit reduction, or 52%, in the number of units shipped, and a $21 million decrease in messaging revenue. The decrease in QIS revenues was primarily attributable to a $45 million decrease in QChat revenues resulting primarily from decreased development efforts under the licensing agreement with Sprint and a $30 million decrease in BREW revenues resulting from lower consumer demand and lower prices due to the slowdown in global economies and competitive pricing pressures. QWI earnings before taxes for fiscal 2009 was $20 million, compared to a loss before taxes of $1 million for fiscal 2008. QWI operating margin percentage was 3% in fiscal 2009, compared to zero percent in fiscal 2008. The increase in QWI earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses at QIS and QES, partially offset by an increase in the operating loss of Firethorn. The increase in QWI operating margin percentage was primarily attributable to improvements in QIS and QES gross margin percentage, partially offset by an increase in the operating loss of Firethorn. QSI Segment. QSI revenues for fiscal 2009 were $29 million, compared to $12 million for fiscal 2008. QSI loss before taxes for fiscal 2009 was $361 million, compared to $304 million for fiscal 2008. QSI revenues are attributable to our FLO TV subsidiary. QSI loss before taxes increased by $57 million primarily due to a $39 million increase in net investment losses (unrelated to FLO TV) and an $18 million increase in our FLO TV subsidiary’s loss before taxes. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 The following should be read in conjunction with the financial results of fiscal 2008 and 2007 for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10 — Segment Information.” QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2008 were $6.72 billion, compared to $5.28 billion for fiscal 2007. Equipment and services revenues, mostly consisting of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, were $6.53 billion for fiscal 2008, compared to $5.12 billion for fiscal 2007. The increase in equipment and services revenues resulted primarily from an increase of $1.23 billion related to higher unit shipments and an increase of $219 million related to the net effects of changes in product mix and the average sales prices of such products. Approximately 336 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2008, compared to approximately 253 million for fiscal 2007. QCT earnings before taxes for fiscal 2008 were $1.83 billion, compared to $1.55 billion for fiscal 2007. QCT operating income as a percentage of its revenues (operating margin percentage) was 27% in fiscal 2008, compared to 29% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in operating margin percentage was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin percentage related to an increase in reserves for excess and obsolete inventory and product support costs. QCT inventories increased by 17% in fiscal 2008 from $387 million to $453 million primarily due to the shift in our manufacturing business model from turnkey to IFM and the related work-in process which includes purchased die and related back-end assembly and test manufacturing services needed to complete QCT integrated circuit products. The increase is also attributable to an increase in finished goods associated with growth in sales volume. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2008 were $3.62 billion, compared to $2.77 billion for fiscal 2007. QTL earnings before taxes for fiscal 2008 were $3.14 billion, compared to $2.34 billion for fiscal 2007. QTL operating margin percentage was 87% in fiscal 2008, compared to 84% in fiscal 2007. The increase in revenues from licensing and royalty fees primarily related to an increase in sales of CDMA-based products reported by QTL licensees other than Nokia, driven by the continued adoption of WCDMA at higher average selling prices than CDMA and fluctuations in currency exchange rates. In addition, QTL revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal 2008 included $560 million (attributable to both fiscal 2008 and 2007) related to the new agreement with Nokia. Revenues from licensing and royalties in fiscal 2007 included royalty payments from Nokia only for sales of Nokia products through April 9, 2007. The increase in earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues and the effect of bad debt expenses recognized in fiscal 2007, partially offset by increases in research and development expenses and patent costs, which resulted in a corresponding increase in operating margin percentage. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2008 were $785 million, compared to $828 million for fiscal 2007. Revenues decreased primarily due to a $78 million decrease in QES revenues, partially offset by a $27 million increase in QIS revenues. The decrease in QES revenues was primarily attributable to an $88 million decrease in revenues from product sales, partially offset by an $11 million increase in messaging revenues. QES shipped approximately 91,200 terrestrial-based and satellite-based systems during fiscal 2008, compared to approximately 190,300 terrestrial-based and satellite-based systems in fiscal 2007. The increase in QIS revenues was primarily 53 Table of Contents attributable to increases in QChat revenues resulting from increased development efforts under a licensing agreement with Sprint and our expanded BREW customer base and products. QWI loss before taxes for fiscal 2008 was $1 million, compared to earnings before taxes of $88 million for fiscal 2007. QWI operating margin percentage was zero percent in fiscal 2008, compared to 11% in fiscal 2007. The decrease in QWI earnings before taxes was primarily due to the decrease in revenues, a $30 million increase in QIS research and development expenses related to our BREW products and a $34 million increase in operating expenses as a result of the acquisition of Firethorn during the first quarter of fiscal 2008, all of which contributed to a corresponding decline in operating margin percentage. QSI Segment. QSI revenues for fiscal 2008 were $12 million, compared to $1 million for fiscal 2007, related to the commencement of our FLO TV service in March 2007. QSI loss before taxes for fiscal 2008 was $304 million, compared to $240 million for fiscal 2007. QSI loss before taxes also included a $71 million increase in our FLO TV subsidiary’s loss before taxes comprised primarily of an increase of $50 million in cost of equipment and services revenues and a $22 million increase in research and development expenses. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $17.7 billion at September 27, 2009, an increase of $6.5 billion from September 28, 2008. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 27, 2009 consisted of $7.9 billion held domestically with the remaining balance of $9.8 billion held by foreign subsidiaries. Due to tax considerations, we derive liquidity for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and investments held domestically. Total cash provided by operating activities increased to $7.2 billion during fiscal 2009, compared to $3.6 billion during fiscal 2008 primarily due to collection of a $2.5 billion licensing receivable paid in October 2008. During fiscal 2009, we repurchased and retired 8,920,000 shares of our common stock for $284 million. At September 27, 2009, approximately $1.7 billion remained authorized for repurchases under our stock repurchase program. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. We intend to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under this program subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that such repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders. We declared and paid dividends totaling $1.1 billion, $982 million and $862 million, or $0.66, $0.60 and $0.52 per common share, during fiscal 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. On October 2, 2009, we announced a cash dividend of $0.17 per share on our common stock, payable on December 23, 2009 to stockholders of record as of November 25, 2009. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in the best interest of our stockholders. Since September 2007, there has been a prolonged disruption in global financial markets that has contributed to a major crisis in debt and equity capital markets and a global economic recession. This period of economic weakness has impacted the value of our marketable securities. At September 27, 2009, gross unrealized gains on marketable securities were $870 million and gross unrealized losses were $196 million. At September 27, 2009, we concluded that the unrealized losses were temporary. Our relative weighting of these factors is reassessed when market or economic conditions change. Further, for equity securities, equity mutual and exchange-traded funds and debt mutual funds with unrealized losses, we have the ability and the intent to hold such securities until they recover, which is expected to be within a reasonable period of time. For debt securities with unrealized losses, we do not have the intent to sell, nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell, such securities. As a result, we do not believe the decline in the fair value of our marketable securities will materially affect our liquidity. Accounts receivable decreased by 83% during fiscal 2009 primarily due to collection of a $2.5 billion licensing receivable, partial payment of amounts receivable for redemptions of money market funds and reclassification of the remaining net balance of these investment receivables to other assets, and a decrease of approximately $580 million in other accounts receivable. Days sales outstanding related to these other accounts receivable were 23 days at September 27, 2009 compared to 34 days at September 28, 2008. The decrease in other trade accounts receivable and the related days sales outstanding were primarily due to the timing of cash receipts related to sales of integrated circuits. We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and our expected cash flow generated from operations, in addition to our substantial untapped debt capacity, will provide us with flexibility and satisfy our working and other capital requirements over the next fiscal year and beyond based on our current business plans. Our total research and development expenditures were $2.4 billion in fiscal 2009 and $2.3 billion in fiscal 2008, and 54 Table of Contents we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development for new technologies, applications and services for the wireless industry. Capital expenditures were $761 million in fiscal 2009 and $1.4 billion in fiscal 2008. Our purchase obligations for fiscal 2010, some of which relate to research and development activities and capital expenditures, totaled $893 million, at September 27, 2009. Pursuant to the Settlement and Patent License and Non-Assert Agreement with Broadcom, we are obligated to pay a remaining $648 million ratably through April 2013. Cash used for strategic investments and acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $54 million in fiscal 2009 and $298 million in fiscal 2008, and we expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions to open new markets for our technology, expand our technology, obtain development resources, grow our patent portfolio or pursue new business opportunities. Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in S-K 303(a)(4)(ii). At September 27, 2009, our outstanding contractual obligations included (in millions): Contractual Obligations Payments Due By Fiscal Period No Beyond Expiration Total 2010 2011-2012 2013-2014 2014 Date Purchase obligations (1) $ 1,207 $ 893 $ 234 $ 25 $ 55 $ — Operating lease obligations 450 84 99 44 223 — Equity funding commitments (2) 4 — — — — 4 Total commitments 1,661 977 333 69 278 4 Capital lease obligations(3) 446 14 27 28 377 — Other long-term liabilities (4)(5) 660 188 344 118 9 1 Total recorded liabilities 1,106 202 371 146 386 1 Total $ 2,767 $ 1,179 $ 704 $ 215 $ 664 $ 5 (1) Total purchase obligations include $683 million in commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories. (2) These commitments do not have fixed funding dates and are subject to certain conditions. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed or funded under these arrangements; actual financing or funding may be in lesser amounts or not at all. (3) Amounts represent future minimum lease payments including interest payments. Capital lease obligations are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at September 27, 2009. (4) Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenues, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. Other long-term liabilities as presented in this table include the related current portions. (5) Our consolidated balance sheet at September 27, 2009 included a $47 million noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions, all of which may result in cash payment. The future payments related to uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities. Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 27, 2009 is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies.” Future Accounting Requirements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) revised the authoritative guidance for business combinations, which establishes principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination (i) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, (ii) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase and (iii) determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination. The guidance will be effective for our fiscal 2010 beginning September 28, 2009 and will change our accounting treatment for business combinations on a prospective basis. The FASB issued authoritative guidance for fair value measurements in September 2006, which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about assets and liabilities measured at fair value in the financial statements. We adopted the provisions of the guidance for financial assets and liabilities effective September 29, 2008 but elected a partial deferral under the provisions related to nonfinancial 55 Table of Contents assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including goodwill, wireless licenses, other intangible and long-lived assets, guarantees and asset retirement obligations. The adoption of this guidance in fiscal 2010 on such nonfinancial assets and liabilities is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2009, the FASB ratified the final consensus reached by the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) that revised the authoritative guidance for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables. The guidance addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting. The guidance will be effective for our fiscal 2011 beginning September 27, 2010 with early adoption permitted. The guidance may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements. We are in the process of evaluating early prospective adoption and determining the effects, if any, the adoption of the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2009, the FASB also ratified the final consensus reached by the EITF that modifies the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude (a) non-software components of tangible products and (b) software components of tangible products that are sold, licensed or leased with tangible products when the software components and non-software components of the tangible product function together to deliver the tangible product’s essential functionality. The guidance will be effective for our fiscal 2011 beginning September 27, 2010 with early adoption permitted. The guidance may be applied retrospectively or prospectively for new or materially modified arrangements. We are in the process of evaluating early prospective adoption and determining the effects, if any, the adoption of the guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Credit Market Risk. Since September 2007, there has been a prolonged disruption in global financial markets that has led to a major crisis in debt and equity capital markets and a global economic recession. This period of economic weakness has impacted the value of most types of investment- and non-investment-grade bonds and debt obligations and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. At September 27, 2009, we held a significant portion of our corporate cash in diversified portfolios of fixed- and floating-rate, investment-grade marketable securities, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, non-investment-grade bank loans and bonds, preferred stocks and other securities that have been affected by these credit market concerns and had temporary gross unrealized losses of $39 million. Although we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary, there is a risk that we may incur net other-than-temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these and other similarly affected securities if U.S. credit and equity markets do not stabilize and recover to previous levels in the coming quarters. Interest Rate Risk. We invest our cash in a number of diversified investment- and non-investment-grade fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and debt mutual funds. We deposit our cash primarily with one major institution. Changes in the general level of United States interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed interest-bearing securities. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed interest-bearing securities could lose value. As interest rates in the general economy have dropped significantly over the past several months, our floating interest-bearing securities are earning less interest income. When the general economy weakens significantly, as it has recently, the credit profile, financial strength and growth prospects of certain issuers of interest-bearing securities held in our investment portfolios may deteriorate, and our interest-bearing securities may lose value either temporarily or other than temporarily. We may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs that do not perform well. The following table provides information about our interest-bearing securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows, weighted-average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed that these securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate these securities for presentation purposes. 56 Table of Contents Interest Rate Sensitivity Principal Amount by Expected Maturity Average Interest Rates (Dollars in millions) No Single 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Maturity Total Fixed interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 470 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 470 Interest rate 0.4 % Available-for-sale securities: Investment grade $ 1,481 $ 1,195 $ 673 $ 235 $ 669 $ 250 $ 2,600 $ 7,103 Interest rate 2.0 % 2.9 % 3.6 % 4.7 % 4.6 % 6.8 % 2.7 % Non-investment grade $ 15 $ 27 $ 30 $ 88 $ 133 $ 713 $ 29 $ 1,035 Interest rate 9.2 % 12.7 % 11.0 % 10.5 % 10.2 % 10.8 % 0.7 % Floating interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,004 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 2,004 Interest rate 0.2 % Available-for-sale securities: Investment grade $ 794 $ 742 $ 227 $ 14 $ — $ 321 $ 619 $ 2,717 Interest rate 1.2 % 1.1 % 0.9 % 0.4 % 8.6 % 3.7 % Non-investment grade $ 6 $ 12 $ 79 $ 204 $ 348 $ 162 $ 894 $ 1,705 Interest rate 26.6 % 7.6 % 6.8 % 6.8 % 7.2 % 9.1 % 4.2 % Cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. Equity Price Risk. The prolonged disruption in global financial markets has caused increased volatility in the fair values of our equity securities and equity mutual and exchange-traded fund shares. We have a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equities held by mutual and exchange-traded fund shares that are subject to equity price risk. We have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size, style, industry and geography, and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund and exchange-traded fund shares at September 27, 2009 would cause a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of $247 million. At September 27, 2009, gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual and exchange-traded fund shares were approximately $157 million. Foreign Exchange Risk. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties. Such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. At September 27, 2009, we had a net liability of $28 million related to foreign currency option contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of CDMA and WCDMA products. Counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major institutions. In the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle transactions, which could materially impact our results. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in each of our hedged foreign currencies, we would incur a loss of approximately $19 million resulting from a decrease in the fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 — The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies. Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies. 57 Table of Contents Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks.",2023-12-30 18:21:39.488554
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview Recent Developments Revenues of $11.0 billion and net income of $3.2 billion for fiscal 2010 were impacted by the following key items: • We shipped approximately 399 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) integrated circuits for CDMA-based wireless devices, an increase of 26%, compared to approximately 317 million MSM integrated circuits in fiscal 2009. The chipset volume in fiscal 2009 was affected by the slowdown in the worldwide economy. • Total reported device sales were approximately $105.7 billion, an increase of approximately 7%, compared to approximately $98.5 billion in fiscal 2009. (1) Against this backdrop, the following recent developments occurred during fiscal 2010 with respect to key elements of our business or our industry: • Worldwide wireless subscribers grew by approximately 15% to reach approximately 5.2 billion.(2) • Worldwide 3G subscribers (all CDMA-based) grew to approximately 1.15 billion, approximately 22% of total wireless subscribers, including approximately 500 million CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO subscribers and approximately 645 million WCDMA/HSPA/TD-SCDMA subscribers. (2) • In the handset market, CDMA-based unit shipments grew an estimated 21% year-over-year, compared to an estimated increase of 14% year-over-year across all technologies. (3) • In June 2010, we won a 20 MHz slot of Broadband Wireless Access (BWA) spectrum in four telecom circles in India as a result of the completion of the BWA spectrum auction for $1.1 billion. We entered the BWA auction to facilitate the deployment of LTE technology as a complement to the existing 3G HSPA and EV-DO networks in India. (1) Total reported device sales is the sum of all reported sales in U.S. dollars (as reported to us by our licensees) of all licensed CDMA-based subscriber devices (including handsets, modules, modem cards and other subscriber devices) by our licensees during a particular period. Not all licensees report sales the same way (e.g., some licensees report sales net of permitted deductions, such as transportation, insurance and packing costs, while other licensees report sales and then identify the amount of permitted deductions in their reports), and the way in which licensees report such information may change from time to time. (2) According to Wireless Intelligence estimates as of November 1, 2010, for the quarter ending September 30, 2010. Wireless Intelligence estimates for CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO subscribers do not include Wireless Local Loop. (3) Based on current reports by Strategy Analytics, a global research and consulting firm, in their August 2010 Global Handset Market Share Update. Our Business and Operating Segments We design, manufacture, have manufactured on our behalf and market digital wireless telecommunications products and services based on our CDMA technology and other technologies. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products, license fees and royalties for use of our intellectual property, messaging and other services and related hardware sales, software development and licensing and related services, software hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content. Operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services, research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses. We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments. These segments are: Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, or QCT; Qualcomm Technology Licensing, or QTL; Qualcomm Wireless & Internet, or QWI; and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives, or QSI. QCT is a leading developer and supplier of CDMA-based integrated circuits and system software for wireless voice and data communications, multimedia functions and global positioning system products. QCT’s integrated circuit products and system software are used in wireless devices, particularly mobile phones, laptops, data modules, handheld wireless computers, data cards and infrastructure equipment. The integrated circuits for wireless devices include the Mobile Station Modem (MSM), Mobile Data Modem (MDM), Qualcomm Single Chip (QSC), Qualcomm Snapdragon (QSD), Radio Frequency (RF), Power Management (PM) and Bluetooth devices. These 32 Table of Contents integrated circuits for wireless devices and system software perform voice and data communication, multimedia and global positioning functions, radio conversion between RF and baseband signals, power management and peripheral connectivity. QCT’s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. The infrastructure equipment integrated circuits and system software perform the core baseband CDMA modem functionality in the wireless operator’s base station equipment. QCT revenues comprised 61%, 59% and 60% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the assembly and final test manufacturing processes. We rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing business models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing business model, we purchase die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party manufacturers for back-end assembly and test services. We refer to this two-stage manufacturing business model as Integrated Fabless Manufacturing (IFM). QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD (including TD-SCDMA), GSM/GPRS/EDGE and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives. QTL receives license fees as well as ongoing royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Ongoing royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g., certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.). QTL revenues comprised 33%, 35% and 33% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues were generated through our licensees’ sales of cdmaOne, CDMA2000 and WCDMA subscriber equipment products. QWI, which includes Qualcomm Enterprise Services (QES), Qualcomm Internet Services (QIS), Qualcomm Government Technologies (QGOV) and Firethorn, generates revenues primarily through mobile information products and services and software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications. QES sells equipment, software and services used by transportation and other companies to connect wirelessly with their assets and workforce. Through September 2010, QES has shipped approximately 1,423,000 terrestrial-based and satellite-based mobile information units. QIS provides content enablement services for the wireless industry, including Brew, the Plaza suite and other services. QIS also provides QChat push-to-talk, QPoint and other products for wireless operators. QGOV provides development, hardware and analytical expertise involving wireless communications technologies to United States government agencies. Firethorn builds and manages software applications that enable mobile commerce services. QWI revenues comprised 6%, 6% and 7% of total consolidated revenues fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. QSI consists of the Company’s strategic investment activities, including FLO TV Incorporated (FLO TV), our wholly-owned wireless multimedia operator subsidiary. QSI makes strategic investments in early-stage and other companies and in wireless spectrum, such as the BWA spectrum recently won in the auction in India, that we believe will open new markets for CDMA- and OFDMA-based technologies, support the design and introduction of new CDMA and OFDMA products and services for wireless voice and internet data communications or possess unique capabilities or technology. Our FLO TV subsidiary offers its service over our nationwide multicast network based on our MediaFLO Media Distribution System (MDS) and MediaFLO technology, which leverages the Forward Link Only (FLO) air interface standard. This network is utilized as a shared resource for wireless operators and their customers in the United States. FLO TV’s network uses the 700 MHz spectrum for which we hold licenses nationwide. We have commenced a restructuring plan under which we expect to exit the current FLO TV service business. Additionally, we continue to evaluate strategic options for the FLO TV business, which include, but are not limited to, operating the FLO TV network under a new wholesale service model; sale to, or joint venture with, a third party; and/or the sale of the spectrum licenses and the discontinuance of the operation of the network. As part of our strategic investment activities, we intend to pursue various exit strategies at some point in the future. Nonreportable segments include: the Qualcomm MEMS Technologies division, which continues to develop an interferometric modulator (IMOD) display technology based on micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) structure 33 Table of Contents combined with thin film optics; the MediaFLO Technologies division, which is comprised of the FLO Technology group, which continues to develop our MediaFLO MDS and MediaFLO technology, and the FLO International group, which markets MediaFLO for deployment outside of the United States; and other product initiatives. Looking Forward The deployment of 3G networks enables increased voice capacity and higher data rates than prior generation networks, thereby supporting more minutes of use and a wide range of mobile broadband data applications for handsets, 3G connected computing devices and other consumer electronics. Many wireless operators are also planning to complement their existing 3G networks by deploying OFDMA-based technology, often called 4G, in new spectrum to gain additional capacity for data services. As a result, we expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for 3G and 3G/4G multimode products and services around the world. As we look forward to the next several months, the following items are likely to have an impact on our business: • The worldwide transition to 3G CDMA-based networks is expected to continue. With the recently completed auction of 3G spectrum in India, we look forward to network launches and expansion of 3G in that region along with the continued expansion of 3G in China. • We expect consumer demand for advanced 3G-based devices, including smartphones, other data devices and new device categories, such as eBook readers and tablets, to continue at a strong pace. We also expect growth in lower-end 3G devices as 3G expands in emerging markets. We still face significant competition in the lower-end market from GSM-based products, particularly in emerging markets. • We expect that CDMA-based device prices will continue to segment into high and low end due to increased development of smartphones and popularity of smartphone applications on the high end and high volumes and active competition throughout the world on both the low and high end. This, along with a tempered economic recovery combined with growth in emerging markets, is expected to continue to impact the average selling price of CDMA-based devices. • We continue to invest significant resources toward the development of technology to increase the data rates available with 3G and 4G networks, wireless baseband chips, converged computing/communication chips, multimedia products, software and services for the wireless industry. • We continue to invest in the evolution of CDMA and a broad range of other technologies, such as LTE, our IMOD display technology and our Snapdragon platform, as part of our vision to enable a wide range of products and technologies. • We have commenced a restructuring plan under which we expect to exit the current FLO TV service business. Additionally, we continue to evaluate strategic options for the FLO TV business, which include, but are not limited to, operating the FLO TV network under a new wholesale service model; sale to, or joint venture with, a third party; and/or the sale of the spectrum licenses and the discontinuance of the operation of the network. In addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless market. However, we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. We expect that such companies will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world. Further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the Risk Factors included in this Annual Report. Revenue Concentrations Revenues from customers in China, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan comprised 29%, 27% , 12% and 9%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2010, as compared to 23%, 35%, 8% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2009, and 21%, 35%, 5% and 14%, respectively, for fiscal 2008. We distinguish revenues from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to which our products, software or services are delivered and, for QTL’s licensing and royalty revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 34 Table of Contents accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets and investments, share-based payments, income taxes and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others. Revenue Recognition. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, royalties and license fees for our intellectual property, messaging and other services and related hardware sales, software development and licensing and related services, software hosting services and services related to delivery of multimedia content. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but actual results may differ from our estimates. We record reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs, including special pricing agreements and other volume-related rebate programs. Certain reductions to revenue for customer incentives are based on estimates, including our assumptions related to historical and projected customer sales volumes, market share and inventory levels. We license or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Licensees typically pay a license fee in one or more installments and ongoing royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit to the licensee, typically five to fifteen years. We earn royalties on such licensed products sold worldwide by our licensees at the time that the licensees’ sales occur. Our licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter. We recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met. From time to time, licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal disputes or other reasons, and when this occurs, the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected. Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. We also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions. At September 26, 2010, our goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $1.5 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. For intangible assets purchased in a business combination or received in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets received (or, for non-monetary exchanges, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values, except when neither the values of the assets received or the assets transferred in non-monetary exchanges are determinable within reasonable limits. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. An estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions which require significant judgment. For example, the income approach generally requires assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows, total addressable market, pricing and share forecasts, competition, technology obsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of certain assets, or our conclusion that the value of certain assets is not reliably estimable, may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models. New information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We assess potential impairments to intangible assets when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or 35 Table of Contents their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our net investment income (loss). We hold minority investments in publicly-traded companies whose share prices may be highly volatile. We also hold investments in other marketable securities, including non-investment-grade debt securities, equity and debt mutual and exchange-traded funds, corporate bonds and notes, auction rate securities and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. These investments, which are recorded at fair value with increases or decreases generally recorded through stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income or loss, totaled $14.9 billion at September 26, 2010. We record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. In addition, the fair values of our strategic investments may be subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring impairment charges. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost, how long the market value of the investment has been below its original cost, the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default or recovery rates of securities in an asset class, negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others, the performance and pricing of the investee’s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the industry and the market in general and analyst recommendations, as applicable. We also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, we may record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded $111 million, $743 million and $502 million, respectively, in net impairment losses on our investments in marketable securities. Share-Based Compensation. Share-based compensation expense recognized during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008 was $615 million, $584 million and $543 million, respectively. Share-based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. We generally estimate the value of stock option awards using a lattice binomial option-pricing model. Accordingly, the fair value of an option award as determined using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. For purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options, we used the implied volatility of market-traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the binomial model. The assumption inputs related to employee exercise behavior include estimates of the post-vest forfeiture rate and suboptimal exercise factors, which are based on historical experience. In addition, judgment is required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, share-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly. Income Taxes. Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, adjustments could be materially different from those which are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. We are participating in the IRS Compliance 36 Table of Contents Assurance Process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the IRS on the treatment of all issues prior to filing our federal return. A benefit of participation in this program is that post-filing adjustments by the IRS are less likely to occur. We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. At September 26, 2010, gross deferred tax assets were $2.8 billion. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results. We can only use net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in certain tax jurisdictions. At September 26, 2010, we had unused federal, state and foreign net operating losses of $114 million, $284 million and $40 million, respectively. Based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities, we expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal 2010. Therefore, we have provided a $17 million valuation allowance for these net operating losses. Significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made. We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $4.2 billion related to the United States federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $10.6 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States. Litigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions. We estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations. For example, we recorded a $783 million charge during fiscal 2009 in connection with a litigation settlement charge related to the Settlement and Patent License and Non-Assert Agreement with Broadcom. We are engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business and, while there can be no assurance, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2010 were $10.99 billion, compared to $10.42 billion for fiscal 2009. Revenues from two customers of our QCT and QTL segments (each of whom accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the period) comprised approximately 25% and 31% in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2010 were $6.98 billion, compared to $6.47 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase in revenues from sales of equipment and services was primarily due to a $541 million increase in QCT revenues. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2010 were $4.01 billion, compared to $3.95 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase in revenues from licensing and royalty fees was primarily due to a $56 million increase in QTL revenues. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2010 was $3.52 billion, compared to $3.18 billion for fiscal 2009. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 50% for fiscal 2010, compared to 49% for fiscal 2009. The decrease in margin percentage was primarily attributable to the effect of increases in costs related to our FLO TV subsidiary and our QMT division, partially offset by an increase in QCT gross margin percentage. Cost of equipment and services revenues included $42 million in share-based compensation in fiscal 2010, compared to $41 million for fiscal 2009. Cost of equipment 37 Table of Contents and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues may fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of products sold and services provided, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2010, research and development expenses were $2.55 billion or 23% of revenues, compared to $2.44 billion or 23% of revenues for fiscal 2009. The dollar increase is primarily attributable to a $156 million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower-cost devices, the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third-party operating systems and services platforms. The increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a $65 million decrease in costs primarily related to the development of our asset-tracking products and services and Brew products. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2010 included share-based compensation of $300 million, compared to $280 million in fiscal 2009. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2010, selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.64 billion or 15% of revenues, compared to $1.56 billion or 15% of revenues for fiscal 2009. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $61 million increase in selling and marketing expenses, a $56 million increase in patent-related costs and a $23 million increase in employee-related expenses, partially offset by a $62 million gain on the sale of our Australia spectrum license. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 included share-based compensation of $273 million, compared to $263 million in fiscal 2009. Other Operating Expenses. Operating expenses for fiscal 2009 included a $783 million charge in connection with the Settlement and Patent License and Non-Assert Agreement with Broadcom and a $230 million fine levied by the KFTC. Net Investment Income. Net investment income was $751 million for fiscal 2010, compared to a net investment loss of $150 million for fiscal 2009. The net increase was comprised as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 26, September 27, 2010 2009 Change Interest and dividend income: Corporate and other segments $ 522 $ 513 $ 9 QSI 8 3 $ 5 Interest expense (58 ) (24 ) (34 ) Net realized gains on investments: Corporate and other segments 379 107 272 QSI 26 30 (4 ) Net impairment losses on investments: Corporate and other segments (110 ) (734 ) 624 QSI (15 ) (29 ) 14 Gains on derivative instruments 3 1 2 Equity in losses of investees (4 ) (17 ) 13 $ 751 $ (150 ) $ 901 During fiscal 2010, we recorded lower impairment losses and higher realized gains on marketable securities, compared to fiscal 2009. Depressed security values caused by a major disruption in the United States and foreign financial markets impacted our results in fiscal 2009 and continued to cause impairment losses in fiscal 2010, but to a much lesser extent. The increase in interest expense is primarily the result of the short-term bank loan related to the BWA spectrum recently won in the India auction. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $787 million for fiscal 2010, compared to $484 million for fiscal 2009. The annual effective tax rate was 20% for fiscal 2010, compared to 23% for fiscal 2009. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was lower than fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of the net decrease in valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to capital losses and an increase in tax benefits related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, partially offset by a decrease in tax benefit related to tax audits settled during the year and a decrease in research and development tax credits. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 20% and only reflected the United States federal research and development credits generated through December 31, 2009, the date on which they expired. The annual effective tax 38 Table of Contents rate for fiscal 2010 of 20% was less than the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of 22% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, 1% related to a decrease in valuation allowance recorded in fiscal 2010 on the deferred tax asset related to capital losses and 1% related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by state taxes of 5% and tax expense of 4% related to the valuation of deferred tax assets to reflect changes in California law, primarily deferred revenue that was taxable in fiscal 2010, but for which the resulting deferred tax asset will reverse in future years when the Company’s state tax rate will be lower. Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowance, increased during fiscal 2010 primarily due to the establishment of the deferred tax asset related to revenue derived from the Company’s 2008 license and settlement agreements with Nokia. Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2009 were $10.42 billion, compared to $11.14 billion for fiscal 2008. Revenues from two customers of our QCT and QTL segments (each of whom accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the period) comprised approximately 31% and 30% in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2009 and 2008, respectively. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2009 were $6.47 billion, compared to $7.16 billion for fiscal 2008. The decrease in revenues from sales of equipment and services was primarily due to a $597 million decrease in QCT revenues and a $79 million decrease in QES revenues. Revenues from licensing and royalty fees for fiscal 2009 were $3.95 billion, compared to $3.98 billion for fiscal 2008. The decrease in revenues from licensing and royalty fees was primarily due to a $26 million decrease in QIS revenues. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2009 was $3.18 billion compared to $3.41 billion for fiscal 2008. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 49% for fiscal 2009, compared to 48% for fiscal 2008. Cost of equipment and services revenues included $41 million in share-based compensation in fiscal 2009, compared to $39 million in fiscal 2008. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2009, research and development expenses were $2.44 billion or 23% of revenues, compared to $2.28 billion or 20% of revenues for fiscal 2008. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $129 million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies, the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower cost devices, the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third-party operating systems and services platforms. Research and development expenses in fiscal 2009 included share-based compensation and in-process research and development of $280 million and $6 million, respectively, compared to $250 million and $14 million, respectively, in fiscal 2008. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2009, selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.56 billion or 15% of revenues, compared to $1.71 billion or 15% of revenues for fiscal 2008. The dollar decrease was primarily attributable to a $110 million decrease in professional fees, of which $72 million related to litigation and other legal matters, a $24 million decrease in selling and marketing expenses and a $19 million decrease in travel expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2009 included share-based compensation of $263 million, compared to $254 million in fiscal 2008. Other Operating Expenses. Operating expenses for fiscal 2009 included a $783 million charge in connection with the Settlement and Patent License and Non-Assert Agreement with Broadcom and a $230 million fine levied by the KFTC. Net Investment (Loss) Income. Net investment loss was $150 million for fiscal 2009, compared to net investment income of $96 million for fiscal 2008. The net decrease was primarily comprised as follows (in millions): 39 Table of Contents Year Ended September 27, September 28, 2009 2008 Change Interest and dividend income: Corporate and other segments $ 513 $ 487 $ 26 QSI 3 4 (1 ) Interest expense (24 ) (22 ) (2 ) Net realized gains on investments: Corporate and other segments 107 104 3 QSI 30 51 (21 ) Net impairment losses on investments: Corporate and other segments (734 ) (502 ) (232 ) QSI (29 ) (33 ) 4 Gains on derivative instruments 1 6 (5 ) Equity in (losses) earnings of investees (17 ) 1 (18 ) $ (150 ) $ 96 $ (246 ) Net impairment losses on marketable securities related primarily to depressed securities values caused by the prolonged disruption in global financial markets affecting consumers and the banking, finance and housing industries. This disruption was evidenced by a deterioration of confidence in financial markets and a severe decline in the availability of capital and demand for debt and equity securities. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $484 million for fiscal 2009, compared to $666 million for fiscal 2008. The annual effective tax rate was 23% for fiscal 2009, compared to 17% for fiscal 2008. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 was higher than the annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 primarily due to a decrease in foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, an increase in the valuation allowance on capital losses recognized in earnings and the revaluation of net deferred tax assets to reflect changes in California law, partially offset by adjustments to prior year estimates of uncertain tax positions as a result of tax audits during fiscal 2009. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2009 of 23% was less than the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of approximately 20% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, 7% related to adjustments to prior year estimates of uncertain tax positions as a result of tax audits during the year and 5% related to research and development tax credits, partially offset by an increase in valuation allowance related to capital losses of 11%, the revaluation of net deferred items of 4% and state taxes of approximately 5%. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 The following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2010 and 2009 financial results for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 10 – Segment Information.” QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2010 were $6.70 billion, compared to $6.14 billion for fiscal 2009. Equipment and services revenues, mostly related to sales of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, were $6.47 billion for fiscal 2010, compared to $5.93 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase in equipment and services revenues resulted primarily from a $1.25 billion increase related to higher unit shipments, partially offset by a decrease of $713 million related to the net effects of changes in product mix and the average selling prices of such products. Approximately 399 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2010, compared to approximately 317 million for fiscal 2009. The chipset volume in fiscal 2009 was impacted by the slowdown in the worldwide economy that caused contraction in the CDMA-based channel inventory and resulted in lower demand for CDMA-based MSM integrated chips. QCT earnings before taxes for fiscal 2010 were $1.69 billion, compared to $1.44 million for fiscal 2009. QCT operating income as a percentage of revenues (operating margin percentage) was 25% in fiscal 2010, compared to 23% in fiscal 2009. The increase in QCT earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues, partially offset by an increase in research and development expenses. The increase in QCT operating margin percentage was primarily due to an increase in gross margin percentage and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues driven primarily by the increase in revenues. QCT gross 40 Table of Contents margin percentage increased as a result of the net effects of a decrease in average unit costs, lower average selling prices and favorable product mix. QCT inventory increased by 18% in fiscal 2010 from $408 million to $481 million primarily due to an increase in work-in-process associated with growth in sales volume and the net effects of changes in integrated circuit product mix. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2010 were $3.66 billion, compared to $3.61 billion for fiscal 2009. Revenues in fiscal 2010 included $71 million attributable to fiscal 2009 that had previously not been recognized due to discussions regarding a license agreement that was signed in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. QTL earnings before taxes for fiscal 2010 were $3.02 billion, compared to $3.07 billion for fiscal 2009. QTL operating margin percentage was 83% in the fiscal 2010, compared to 85% in fiscal 2009. The decrease in QTL earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to an increase in patent-related costs, partially offset by the increase in revenues, which resulted in a corresponding decrease in operating margin percentage. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2010 were $628 million, compared to $641 million for fiscal 2009. Revenues decreased primarily due to a $56 million decrease in QIS revenues, partially offset by a $31 million increase in QES revenues. The decrease in QIS revenues was primarily attributable to a $39 million decrease in QChat revenues resulting from decreased development efforts under the licensing agreement with Sprint and a $16 million decrease in Brew revenues resulting from lower consumer demand. The increase in QES revenues was primarily attributable to a $58 million increase in equipment revenue resulting from higher unit shipments, partially offset by a $31 million decrease in messaging and other services revenue. QWI earnings before taxes for fiscal 2010 were $12 million, compared to $20 million for fiscal 2009. QWI operating margin percentage was 1% in fiscal 2010, compared to 3% in fiscal 2009. The decrease in QWI earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenues, partially offset by a decrease in research and development expenses. The decrease in QWI operating margin percentage was primarily attributable to a decrease in QIS gross margin percentage, partially offset by the decrease in research and development expenses. QSI Segment. QSI revenues for fiscal 2010 were $9 million, compared to $29 million for fiscal 2009. Revenues were attributable to our FLO TV subsidiary. The decrease in FLO TV revenues was primarily due to an increase in customer-related incentives that were recorded as reductions in revenues and lower service-related revenues. QSI loss before taxes for fiscal 2010 was $436 million, compared to $361 million for fiscal 2009. QSI loss before taxes increased by $75 million primarily due to a $135 million increase in our FLO TV subsidiary’s loss before taxes, partially offset by a $62 million gain on the sale of our Australia spectrum license. We have commenced a restructuring plan under which we expect to exit the current FLO TV service business. There were no significant expenses recognized in fiscal 2010 related to this restructuring plan. In addition to our ongoing operating costs, we expect to incur restructuring charges related to this plan in the range of $125 million to $175 million in fiscal 2011, which are primarily related to certain contractual obligations. Additional charges, including impairment of assets, may be incurred as we continue to evaluate or implement strategic options or if we are unable to generate adequate future cash flows associated with this business. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 The following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2009 and 2008 financial results for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 10 – Segment Information.” QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2009 were $6.14 billion, compared to $6.72 billion for fiscal 2008. Equipment and services revenues, mostly related to sales of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, were $5.93 billion for fiscal 2009, compared to $6.53 billion for fiscal 2008. The decrease in equipment and services revenues resulted primarily from a $770 million decrease related to lower unit shipments, caused by the contraction in CDMA-based channel inventory. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $113 million related to the net effects of changes in product mix and the average selling prices of such products. Approximately 317 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2009, compared to approximately 336 million for fiscal 2008. QCT earnings before taxes for fiscal 2009 were $1.44 billion, compared to $1.83 billion for fiscal 2008. QCT operating income as a percentage of revenues (operating margin percentage) was 23% in fiscal 2009, compared to 27% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating margin percentage was primarily due to increased research and development expenses while revenues declined. QCT inventories decreased by 10% in fiscal 2009 from $453 million to $408 million primarily due to the net effects of changes in integrated circuit product mix and a decrease in average unit costs. 41 Table of Contents QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2009 were $3.61 billion, compared to $3.62 billion for fiscal 2008. QTL earnings before taxes for fiscal 2009 were $3.07 billion, compared to $3.14 billion for fiscal 2008. QTL operating margin percentage was 85% in fiscal 2009, compared to 87% in fiscal 2008. The decrease in earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to an increase in amortization related to acquired patents, partially offset by a decrease in professional fees related to litigation and other legal matters, which resulted in a corresponding decline in operating margin percentage. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2009 were $641 million, compared to $785 million for fiscal 2008. Revenues decreased primarily due to a $79 million decrease in QES revenues and a $71 million decrease in QIS revenues. The decrease in QES revenues was primarily attributable to a $50 million decrease in revenues from hardware product sales, due to a 47,500-unit reduction, or 52%, in the number of units shipped, and a $21 million decrease in messaging revenue. The decrease in QIS revenues was primarily attributable to a $45 million decrease in QChat revenues resulting primarily from decreased development efforts under the licensing agreement with Sprint and a $30 million decrease in Brew revenues resulting from lower consumer demand and lower prices due to the slowdown in global economies and competitive pricing pressures. QWI earnings before taxes for fiscal 2009 were $20 million, compared to a loss before taxes of $1 million for fiscal 2008. QWI operating margin percentage was 3% in fiscal 2009, compared to zero percent in fiscal 2008. The increase in QWI earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses of QIS and QES, partially offset by an increase in the operating loss of Firethorn. The increase in QWI operating margin percentage was primarily attributable to improvements in QIS and QES gross margin percentage, partially offset by an increase in the operating loss of Firethorn. QSI Segment. QSI revenues for fiscal 2009 were $29 million, compared to $12 million for fiscal 2008. QSI loss before taxes for fiscal 2009 was $361 million, compared to $304 million for fiscal 2008. QSI revenues were attributable to our FLO TV subsidiary. QSI loss before taxes increased by $57 million primarily due to a $39 million increase in net investment losses (unrelated to FLO TV) and an $18 million increase in our FLO TV subsidiary’s loss before taxes. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $18.4 billion at September 26, 2010, an increase of $660 million from September 27, 2009. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 26, 2010 consisted of $6.3 billion held domestically and $12.1 billion held by foreign subsidiaries. Due to tax and accounting considerations, we derive liquidity for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and investments held domestically. Total cash provided by operating activities decreased to $4.1 billion during fiscal 2010, compared to $7.2 billion during fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to collection of the $2.5 billion trade receivable in fiscal 2009 related to the license and settlement agreements completed with Nokia in September 2008. During fiscal 2010, we repurchased and retired 79,789,000 shares of our common stock for $3.0 billion. On March 1, 2010, we announced that we had been authorized to repurchase up to $3.0 billion of our common stock, and $1.7 billion of that amount remained available at September 26, 2010. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. We intend to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under this program as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that stock repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders. We declared and paid dividends totaling $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $982 million, or $0.72, $0.66 and $0.60 per common share, during fiscal 2010, 2009 and 2008. On March 1, 2010, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend per share of common stock from $0.17 to $0.19. We announced cash dividends totaling $305 million, or $0.19 per share, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010, which were paid on September 24, 2010. On October 13, 2010, we announced a cash dividend of $0.19 per share on our common stock, payable on December 22, 2010 to stockholders of record as of November 24, 2010. We intend to continue to use cash dividends as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to capital availability and periodic determinations that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Accounts receivable increased 4% during fiscal 2010. Days sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, were 22 days at September 26, 2010 compared to 23 days at September 27, 2009. 42 Table of Contents We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and our expected cash flow generated from operations will provide us with flexibility and satisfy our working and other capital requirements over the next fiscal year and beyond based on our current business plans. The following working and other capital requirements are anticipated in fiscal 2011: • Our total research and development expenditures were $2.5 billion and $2.4 billion in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively, and we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development for new technologies, applications and services for the wireless industry. • Capital expenditures were $426 million and $761 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively, and advance payment on spectrum was $1.1 billion in fiscal 2010. We anticipate that capital expenditures excluding the fiscal 2010 advance payment on spectrum will be more than three times higher in fiscal 2011 as compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to the construction of a new manufacturing facility in fiscal 2011 for our QMT division. Future capital expenditures may also be impacted by transactions that are currently not forecasted. • Our purchase obligations for fiscal 2011, some of which relate to research and development activities and capital expenditures, totaled $1.4 billion at September 26, 2010. • In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we expect to pay $1.4 billion to the United States tax authorities as a result of the cash and intangible assets received in connection with the 2008 license and settlement agreements with Nokia. We intend to use cash held domestically to settle this obligation. • In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, we are obligated to repay a $1.1 billion short-term bank loan that is denominated in Indian rupees. The loan has a fixed interest rate of 6.75% per year with interest payments due monthly. The loan is related to the BWA spectrum recently won in the India auction. We expect to refinance a substantial portion of this short-term bank loan with a long-term bank loan in the first half of fiscal 2011. • Pursuant to the Settlement and Patent License and Non-Assert Agreement with Broadcom, we are obligated to pay a remaining $475 million ratably through April 2013, including imputed interest, of which $173 million is payable in fiscal 2011. • In fiscal 2011, we anticipate incurring cash expenditures associated with the expected exit of the current FLO TV service business in the range of $160 million to $210 million, primarily related to certain contractual obligations, in addition to FLO TV’s ongoing cash expenditures. Additional cash expenditures may be incurred as we continue to evaluate or implement strategic options or if we are unable to generate adequate future cash flows associated with this business. • Cash used for strategic investments and acquisitions, net of cash acquired, was $94 million and $54 million in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively, and we expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions to open new markets for our technology, expand our technology, obtain development resources, grow our patent portfolio or pursue new business opportunities. Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in S-K 303(a)(4)(ii). At September 26, 2010, our outstanding contractual obligations included (in millions): 43 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations Payments Due By Fiscal Period No Beyond Expiration Total 2011 2012-2013 2014-2015 2015 Date Purchase obligations (1) $ 1,729 $ 1,401 $ 222 $ 67 $ 39 $ — Operating lease obligations 471 95 100 48 228 — Equity funding commitments (2) 30 — — — — 30 Total commitments 2,230 1,496 322 115 267 30 Loan payable to banks 1,086 1,086 — — — — Capital lease obligations(3) 521 17 32 34 438 — Other long-term liabilities (4)(5) 305 — 293 — 12 — Total recorded liabilities 1,912 1,103 325 34 450 — Total $ 4,142 $ 2,599 $ 647 $ 149 $ 717 $ 30 (1) Total purchase obligations include $1.2 billion in commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories. (2) These commitments do not have fixed funding dates and are subject to certain conditions. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed or funded under these arrangements; actual financing or funding may be in lesser amounts or not at all. (3) Amounts represent future minimum lease payments including interest payments. Capital lease obligations are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at September 26, 2010. (4) Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenues, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. Other long-term liabilities as presented in this table include the related current portions. (5) Our consolidated balance sheet at September 26, 2010 included a $6 million noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions, all of which may result in cash payment. The future payments related to uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities. Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 26, 2010 is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies.” Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. We invest our cash in a number of diversified investment- and non-investment-grade fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and debt mutual funds. Changes in the general level of United States interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed interest-bearing securities. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed interest-bearing securities could lose value. When the general economy weakens significantly, the credit profile, financial strength and growth prospects of certain issuers of interest-bearing securities held in our investment portfolios may deteriorate, and our interest-bearing securities may lose value either temporarily or other than temporarily. We may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs that do not perform well. The following table provides information about our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and loan payable to banks that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows, weighted-average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed that the interest-bearing securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate the securities for presentation purposes. 44 Table of Contents Principal Amount by Expected Maturity Average Interest Rates (Dollars in millions) No Single 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Maturity Total Fixed interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 698 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 698 Interest rate 0.3 % Time deposits $ 400 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 400 Interest rate 0.6 % Available-for-sale securities: Investment grade $ 1,299 $ 672 $ 695 $ 558 $ 162 $ 229 $ 1,818 $ 5,433 Interest rate 2.2 % 3.3 % 2.7 % 3.9 % 3.7 % 7.9 % 1.3 % Non-investment grade $ 11 $ 25 $ 45 $ 107 $ 234 $ 836 $ 20 $ 1,278 Interest rate 12.6 % 8.7 % 9.7 % 9.6 % 10.3 % 8.7 % 0.7 % Floating interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents $ 2,488 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 2,488 Interest rate 0.2 % Available-for-sale securities: Investment grade $ 785 $ 499 $ 225 $ 35 $ 29 $ 465 $ 451 $ 2,489 Interest rate 1.0 % 0.8 % 0.9 % 1.7 % 1.0 % 8.7 % 2.8 % Non-investment grade $ 5 $ 39 $ 137 $ 317 $ 146 $ 372 $ 1,071 $ 2,087 Interest rate 7.6 % 5.7 % 6.5 % 6.6 % 6.4 % 7.0 % 4.1 % Loan payable to banks $ 1,086 $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ — $ 1,086 Fixed interest rate 6.8 % Cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value. The loan payable to banks approximates fair value. Equity Price Risk. We have a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equity securities held by mutual and exchange-traded fund shares that are subject to equity price risk. We have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size, style, industry and geography, and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund and exchange-traded fund shares at September 26, 2010 would cause a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of $270 million. At September 26, 2010, gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual and exchange-traded fund shares were $11 million. Although we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary, there is a risk that we may incur net other-than-temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these securities if they do not recover in value within a reasonable period. Foreign Exchange Risk. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties. Such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. Counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major institutions. In the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us, which could have a negative impact on our results. At September 26, 2010, we had a net liability of $13 million related to foreign currency option contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain international licensees on their sales of CDMA-based devices and a net liability of $2 million related to foreign currency option contracts that have been rendered ineffective as a result of changes in our forecast of royalty revenues. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by 50% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in each of our hedged foreign currencies, we would incur a loss of approximately $16 million resulting from a decrease in the fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective. In addition, we are subject to market risk on foreign currency option contracts that have been deemed ineffective. If foreign exchange rates relevant to those contracts were to change unfavorably by 20%, we would incur a loss of $20 million resulting from a decrease in the fair value of our hedges. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 — The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies. 45 Table of Contents At September 26, 2010, we had a fixed-rate short-term bank loan of $1.1 billion, which is payable in full in Indian rupees in December 2010. The loan is payable in the functional currency of our consolidated subsidiary that is party to the loan, however we are subject to foreign currency translation risk, which may impact the amount of our liability for principal repayment and interest expense we record in the future. If the foreign currency exchange rate were to change unfavorably by 20%, additional interest expense would be negligible due to the short-term nature of the loan. At September 26, 2010, we had an asset of $7 million related to foreign currency forward contracts that were not designated as hedges of certain payments to be made in Indian rupees in connection with the bank loan. We are subject to market risk on such contracts. If the foreign exchange rates relevant to those contracts were to change unfavorably by 20%, we would incur a loss of $57 million. Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies. Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks.",2023-12-30 18:21:43.905858
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIn addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report.OverviewRecent DevelopmentsRevenues for fiscal 2011 were $15.0 billion, with net income of $4.3 billion, which were impacted by the following key items:•We shipped approximately 483 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) integrated circuits for CDMA- and OFDMA-based wireless devices, an increase of 21%, compared to approximately 399 million MSM integrated circuits in fiscal 2010. (1) •Total reported device sales were approximately $149.5 billion, an increase of approximately 41%, compared to approximately $105.7 billion in fiscal 2010. (2) •On May 24, 2011, we acquired Atheros Communications, Inc., which was renamed Qualcomm Atheros, Inc. (Atheros), for total cash consideration of $3.1 billion, net of cash acquired, and the exchange of equity awards. Atheros was integrated into the Qualcomm CDMA Technologies (QCT) segment.•We executed a restructuring plan under which the FLO TV business and network were shut down, and we are no longer pursing our MediaFLO technologies business. We recorded net restructuring and restructuring-related charges of $358 million in fiscal 2011. Our results of operations reflect the presentation of the FLO TV business as discontinued operations, and all prior period amounts have been adjusted accordingly.Against this backdrop, the following recent developments occurred during fiscal 2011 with respect to key elements of our business or our industry:•Worldwide wireless connections grew by approximately 14% to reach approximately 5.9 billion. (3) •Worldwide 3G connections (all CDMA-based) grew to approximately 1.5 billion, approximately 25% of total wireless connections, including approximately 536 million CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO connections and approximately 951 million WCDMA/HSPA/TD-SCDMA connections. (3) •Unit shipments of CDMA-based handsets grew an estimated 28% year-over-year, compared to an estimated increase of 12% year-over-year across all wireless technologies. (4) (1) During fiscal 2011, some customers built devices that incorporated two MSMs. In such cases, which represent less than 1% of our gross volume, we count only one MSM in reporting the MSM shipments.(2) Total reported device sales is the sum of all reported sales in U.S. dollars (as reported to us by our licensees) of all licensed CDMA-based subscriber devices (including handsets, modules, modem cards and other subscriber devices) by our licensees during a particular period. Not all licensees report sales the same way (e.g., some licensees report sales net of permitted deductions, such as transportation, insurance and packing costs, while other licensees report sales and then identify the amount of permitted deductions in their reports), and the way in which licensees report such information may change from time to time. Total reported device sales for a particular period may include prior period activity that was not reported by the licensee until such particular period.(3) According to Wireless Intelligence estimates as of October 31, 2011, for the quarter ending September 30, 2011. Wireless Intelligence estimates for CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO connections do not include Wireless Local Loop.(4) Based on current reports by Strategy Analytics, a global research and consulting firm, in their August 2011 Global Handset Market Share Update.Our Business and Operating SegmentsWe design, manufacture, have manufactured on our behalf and market digital communications products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products, fixed license fees (payable in one or more installments) and ongoing royalties for use of our intellectual property, messaging and other services and related hardware sales, software development and licensing and related services and software hosting services. Operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services, research and development and selling, 30general and administrative expenses.We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments. These segments are: Qualcomm CDMA Technologies, or QCT; Qualcomm Technology Licensing, or QTL; Qualcomm Wireless & Internet, or QWI; and Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives, or QSI.QCT is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies for use in voice and data communications, networking, application processing, multimedia and global positioning system products. QCT’s integrated circuit products and system software are sold to or licensed to manufacturers that use our products in wireless devices, particularly mobile phones, tablets, laptops, data modules, handheld wireless computers and gaming devices, access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment, and in wired devices, particularly broadband gateway equipment, desktop computers, televisions and Blu-ray players. The MSM integrated circuits, which include the Mobile Data Modem, Qualcomm Single Chip and Qualcomm Snapdragon devices, perform the core baseband modem functionality in wireless devices providing voice and data communications, as well as multimedia applications and global positioning functions. In addition, our Snapdragon enabled integrated circuits provide advanced application processing capabilities. QCT’s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. QCT revenues comprised 59%, 61% and 59% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Integrated circuits are die, cut from silicon wafers, that have been assembled into packages or modules and have completed the final test manufacturing processes. We rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing business models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing business model, we purchase wafers and die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party manufacturers for probe, assembly and final test services.QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing cdmaOne, CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD (including TD-SCDMA), GSM/GPRS/EDGE and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives. QTL licensing revenues are comprised of license fees as well as royalties based on worldwide sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g., certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.). QTL revenues comprised 36%, 33% and 35% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues were generated through our licensees’ sales of cdmaOne, CDMA2000 and WCDMA subscriber equipment products.QWI, which includes Qualcomm Enterprise Services (QES), Qualcomm Internet Services (QIS), Qualcomm Government Technologies (QGOV) and Firethorn, generates revenues primarily through mobile information products and services and software and software development aimed at support and delivery of wireless applications. QES sells equipment, software and services used by transportation and other companies to connect wirelessly with their assets and workforce. Through September 2011, QES has shipped approximately 1,511,000 terrestrial-based and satellite-based mobile information units. QIS provides content enablement services for the wireless industry, including Brew, the Plaza suite and other services. QIS also provides QChat push-to-talk and other products for wireless operators. QGOV provides development, hardware, analytical expertise and services involving wireless communications technologies to United States government agencies. Firethorn builds and manages software applications that enable mobile commerce services. QWI revenues comprised 4%, 6% and 6% of total consolidated revenues fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.QSI makes strategic investments that we believe will open new opportunities for our technologies, support the design and introduction of new products and services for voice and data communications or possess unique capabilities or technology. Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies. QSI also holds wireless spectrum. As part of our strategic investment activities, we intend to pursue various exit strategies at some point in the future. The results of QSI’s FLO TV business is presented as discontinued operations. Since the shut down of the FLO TV business and network on March 27, 2011, we have been working to sell our remaining assets and exit contracts. On December 20, 2010, we announced that we have agreed to sell substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum for $1.9 billion, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approval by the U.S. FCC.Nonreportable segments include the Qualcomm MEMS Technologies division, which continues to develop an IMOD display technology based on micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) structure combined with thin film optics, and 31other product initiatives. Discontinued OperationsOn December 20, 2010, we agreed to sell substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum for $1.9 billion, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approval by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The agreement terminates on January 13, 2012; however, either party can extend the agreement for another 90 days thereafter if the FCC approval has not been received by then. The agreement followed our previously announced plan to restructure and evaluate strategic options related to the FLO TV business and network. The FLO TV business and network were shut down on March 27, 2011. Since then, we have been working to sell the remaining assets and exit contracts. The 700 MHz spectrum with a carrying value of $746 million that we have agreed to sell was classified as held for sale, and all other assets were considered disposed of, at September 25, 2011. Accordingly, the results of operations of the FLO TV business were presented as discontinued operations at September 25, 2011. Loss from discontinued operations includes share-based payments and excludes certain general corporate expenses allocated to the FLO TV business during the periods presented. Our statements of operations for all prior periods have been adjusted to conform.Summarized results from discontinued operations were as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 25, 2011 September 26, 2010 September 27, 2009Revenues$5 $9 $29Loss from discontinued operations(507) (459) (327)Income tax benefit194 186 127Discontinued operations, net of income taxes$(313) $(273) $(200)Restructuring and restructuring-related activities under our plan related to discontinued operations were initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2010 and are expected to be substantially complete by the end of fiscal 2012 as we continue to negotiate the exit of certain contracts and remove certain of our equipment from the network sites. During fiscal 2011, we recorded $300 million in restructuring-related charges, primarily consisting of asset impairments and accelerated depreciation, and net restructuring charges of $58 million, including $48 million in contract termination costs. We estimate that we will incur future restructuring and restructuring-related charges of up to $25 million, primarily related to lease exit costs. We may also realize certain gains, primarily due to the potential release of liabilities associated with ongoing efforts to exit certain contracts, the amount of which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Future cash expenditures are expected to be in the range of $75 million to $115 million. Looking ForwardThe deployment of 3G networks enables increased voice capacity and higher data rates than prior generation networks, thereby supporting more minutes of use and a wide range of mobile broadband data applications for handsets, 3G connected computing devices and other consumer electronics. Many wireless operators have or are planning to complement their existing 3G networks by deploying OFDMA-based technology, often called 4G, in new spectrum to gain additional capacity for data services. As a result, we expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for 3G and 3G/4G multimode products and services around the world. In addition, we expect an increasing number of devices, such as computers, consumer electronics and networking equipment, to require multiple communications technologies to support a variety of connected applications. As we look forward to the next several months, the following items are likely to have an impact on our business:•The worldwide transition from 2G to 3G CDMA-based networks is expected to continue, including the further expansion of 3G in China, India and other emerging regions. •We expect consumer demand for advanced 3G-based and 3G/4G multimode devices, including smartphones and data-centric devices, such as tablets and e-readers, to continue at a strong pace. We also expect growth in lower-end 3G devices as 3G expands in emerging regions. •We expect that CDMA-based device prices will continue to vary broadly due to the increased penetration of smartphones combined with active competition throughout the world at all price tiers. This, along with varying rates of economic growth by region and stronger than average growth in emerging regions, is expected to continue to impact the average and range of selling prices of CDMA-based devices.•We continue to invest significant resources toward the development of technologies and products for voice and data communications, primarily in the wireless industry, including advancements to 3G CDMA and 4G LTE networks, 32wireless baseband chips, our converged computing/communications (Snapdragon) chips, multimedia products, software and services, as well as our IMOD display technology.•We have agreed to sell substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum for $1.9 billion, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approval from the U.S. Federal Communications Commission. If the closing conditions are met, we expect to recognize a gain in discontinued operations of $1.2 billion.In addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry. However, we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. We expect that such companies will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world.Further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the Risk Factors included in this Annual Report.Revenue ConcentrationsRevenues from customers in China, South Korea, Taiwan and Japan comprised 32%, 19%, 17% and 8%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2011, as compared to 29%, 27%, 12% and 9%, respectively, for fiscal 2010, and 23%, 35%, 8% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2009. We distinguish revenues from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to which our products, software or services are delivered and, for QTL’s licensing and royalty revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets and investments, share-based payments, income taxes and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the following significant accounting estimates may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others. Revenue Recognition. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, licensing of our intellectual property and software, and sales of messaging, software hosting, software development and other services and related hardware. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations. Determination of the appropriate amount of revenue recognized involves judgments and estimates that we believe are reasonable, but actual results may differ from our estimates.We license or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Licensing revenues include license fees (payable in one or more installments) and ongoing royalties based on licensees’ sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee, typically 5 to 15 years. We recognize royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met. From time to time, licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal disputes or other reasons, and when this occurs, the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected. Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. We also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions. At September 25, 2011, our goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $3.4 billion and $3.1 billion, respectively. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. For intangible assets purchased in a business combination or received in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets received (or, for non-monetary exchanges, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values, except when neither the values of the assets received or the assets transferred in non-monetary exchanges are determinable within reasonable limits. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. An estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions that require 33significant judgment. For example, the income approach generally requires assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows, total addressable market, pricing and share forecasts, competition, technology obsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of certain assets, or our conclusion that the value of certain assets is not reliably estimable, may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models. New information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill and other intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on all or a portion of our goodwill and other intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. During fiscal 2011, we recorded a $114 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Firethorn division due to the operating performance of a new product application falling significantly short of expectations.We hold investments in marketable securities, including equity securities, non-investment-grade debt securities, equity and debt mutual and exchange-traded funds, corporate bonds and notes, auction rate securities and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. The fair value of these investments totaled $15.5 billion at September 25, 2011, with increases and decreases in fair value generally recorded through stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income or loss. We record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. In addition, the fair values of our strategic investments may be subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring impairment charges. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost; how long the market value of the investment has been below its original cost; the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default or recovery rates of securities in an asset class; negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others; the performance and pricing of the investee’s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the industry and the market in general; and analyst recommendations, as applicable. We also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, we may record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded $39 million, $111 million and $743 million, respectively, in net impairment losses on our investments in marketable securities. Share-Based Compensation. Share-based compensation expense recognized during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $821 million, $614 million and $584 million, respectively. Share-based compensation is measured at the grant date, or at the acquisition date for assumed awards, based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted using a lattice binomial option-pricing model and the fair value of stock option awards assumed using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Accordingly, the fair value of an option award as determined using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price on the valuation date as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. For purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options, we used the implied volatility of market-traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the option-pricing model. The assumption inputs related to employee exercise behavior include estimates of the post-vest forfeiture rate and suboptimal exercise factors, which are based on historical experience. Beginning in fiscal 2010, we began to issue restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees. Since such time, the number of stock options granted to employees has decreased, and we expect this trend to continue into the foreseeable future. We estimate the fair value of RSUs based on the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant or date the awards are assumed. If RSUs do not have the right to participate in dividends, the fair value is discounted by the dividend yield. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from 34our estimate, share-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly. Income Taxes. Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. Although we believe that the estimates and assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, adjustments could be materially different from those that are reflected in historical income tax provisions and recorded assets and liabilities. We are participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the IRS on the treatment of all issues prior to filing our federal return. A benefit of participation in this program is that post-filing adjustments by the IRS are less likely to occur.We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. At September 25, 2011, net deferred tax assets were $2.7 billion, which included a valuation allowance of $98 million. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results.We can only use net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in certain tax jurisdictions. At September 25, 2011, we had unused federal, state and foreign net operating losses of $167 million, $352 million and $76 million, respectively. Based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities, we expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal 2011. Therefore, we have provided a $29 million valuation allowance for these net operating losses. Significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made.We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $4.7 billion related to the United States federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $13.5 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States. Litigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings. Although there can be no assurance that unfavorable outcomes in any of these matters would not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position, we believe the claims are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the actions. We estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations. For example, we recorded a $783 million charge during fiscal 2009 in connection with a litigation settlement related to the Settlement and Patent License and Non-Assert Agreement with Broadcom. We are engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business and, while there can be no assurance, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these actions will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity or financial position.Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2011 were $14.96 billion, compared to $10.98 billion for fiscal 2010. Revenues from two customers of our QCT and QTL segments (each of whom accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the period) comprised approximately 26% and 25% in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively.Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2011 were $9.22 billion, compared to $6.97 billion for fiscal 352010. The increase in revenues from sales of equipment and services was primarily due to a $2.18 billion increase in QCT equipment and services revenues. Licensing revenues were $5.73 billion in fiscal 2011, compared to $4.01 billion in fiscal 2010. The increase in licensing revenues was primarily due to a $1.76 billion increase in QTL revenues. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2011 was $4.88 billion, compared to $3.30 billion for fiscal 2010. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 53% for fiscal 2011, compared to 47% for fiscal 2010. The decrease in margin percentage was primarily attributable to a decrease in QCT gross margin percentage and the effect of $137 million in charges from the recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value and amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of Atheros in fiscal 2011. Cost of equipment and services revenues included $67 million in share-based compensation in fiscal 2011, compared to $41 million in fiscal 2010. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues may fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of products sold and services provided, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2011 were $3.00 billion or 20% of revenues, compared to $2.45 billion or 22% of revenues for fiscal 2010. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $403 million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next generation technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services, including lower-cost devices, the integration of wireless with consumer electronics and computing, the convergence of multiband, multimode, multinetwork products and technologies, third-party operating systems and services platforms. The percentage decrease was primarily attributable to the 36% increase in revenues relative to the 22% increase in cost. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2011 included share-based compensation of $397 million, compared to $293 million in fiscal 2010. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 were $1.95 billion or 13% of revenues, compared to $1.50 billion or 14% of revenues for fiscal 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 included a $62 million gain on the sale of our Australia spectrum license. The remaining dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $142 million increase in employee-related expenses, a $66 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, primarily attributable to the acquisition of Atheros, a $44 million increase in charitable contributions, primarily resulting from the establishment of the Qualcomm Charitable Foundation in fiscal 2011, and a $21 million increase in outside services. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2011 included share-based compensation of $349 million, compared to $263 million in fiscal 2010. Other Operating Expenses. We recorded a $114 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Firethorn division due to the operating performance of a new product application falling significantly short of expectations in fiscal 2011. Net Investment Income. Net investment income was $661 million for fiscal 2011, compared to $766 million for fiscal 2010. The net decrease was comprised as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 25, 2011 September 26, 2010 ChangeInterest and dividend income: Corporate and other segments$480 $522 $(42)QSI20 8 $12Interest expense(114) (43) (71)Net realized gains on investments: Corporate and other segments335 379 (44)QSI2 26 (24)Net impairment losses on investments: Corporate and other segments(39) (110) 71QSI(13) (15) 2(Losses) gains on derivative instruments(3) 3 (6)Equity in losses of investees(7) (4) (3) $661 $766 $(105)The increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to the bank loans related to the BWA spectrum won in the India auction in June 2010. The decrease in net impairment losses on investments is due to an overall increase in marketable securities values compared to the prior fiscal year. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $1.1 billion for fiscal 2011, compared to $973 million for fiscal 2010. The 36annual effective tax rate was 20% for fiscal 2011, compared to 22% for fiscal 2010. During the first quarter of fiscal 2011, the United States government extended the federal research and development tax credit to include qualified research expenditures paid or incurred after December 31, 2009 and before January 1, 2012. We recorded a tax benefit of $32 million related to fiscal 2010 in fiscal 2011 from the retroactive extension of this credit. Additionally, in fiscal 2011, we recorded a tax benefit of $44 million related to an agreement reached on a component of our fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2010 state tax returns. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 included tax expense of approximately $137 million that arose because certain deferred revenue was taxable in fiscal 2010, but the resulting deferred tax asset will reverse in future years when our state tax rate will be lower as a result of California tax legislation enacted in 2009. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 of 20% was less than the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of 19% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate and benefits of 3% related to the research and development tax credit, partially offset by state taxes of 5% and tax expense of 1% related to the valuation of deferred tax assets to reflect changes in California law.Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Revenues. Total revenues for fiscal 2010 were $10.98 billion, compared to $10.39 billion for fiscal 2009. Revenues from two customers of our QCT and QTL segments (each of whom accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the period) comprised approximately 25% and 31% in aggregate of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Revenues from sales of equipment and services for fiscal 2010 were $6.97 billion, compared to $6.44 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase in revenues from sales of equipment and services was primarily due to a $541 million increase in QCT revenues. Licensing revenues were $4.01 billion in fiscal 2010, compared to $3.95 billion in fiscal 2009. The increase in licensing revenues was primarily due to a $56 million increase in QTL revenues. Cost of Equipment and Services. Cost of equipment and services revenues for fiscal 2010 was $3.30 billion, compared to $3.03 billion for fiscal 2009. Cost of equipment and services revenues as a percentage of equipment and services revenues was 47% for both fiscal 2010 and 2009. The margin percentage was negatively impacted by the effect of an increase in costs related to our QMT division, which was offset by an increase in QCT gross margin percentage. Cost of equipment and services revenues included $41 million in share-based compensation in fiscal 2010, compared to $40 million for fiscal 2009. Research and Development Expenses. For fiscal 2010, research and development expenses were $2.45 billion or 22% of revenues, compared to $2.35 billion or 23% of revenues for fiscal 2009. The dollar increase is primarily attributable to a $156 million increase in costs related to the development of integrated circuit products, next generation CDMA and OFDMA technologies and other initiatives to support the acceleration of advanced wireless products and services. The increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by a $69 million decrease in costs primarily related to the development of our asset-tracking products and services and Brew products. Research and development expenses for fiscal 2010 included share-based compensation of $293 million, compared to $272 million in fiscal 2009. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For fiscal 2010, selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.50 billion or 14% of revenues, compared to $1.46 billion or 14% of revenues for fiscal 2009. The dollar increase was primarily attributable to a $56 million increase in patent-related costs, a $25 million increase in employee-related expenses and a $16 million increase in selling and marketing expenses, partially offset by a $62 million gain on the sale of our Australia spectrum license. Selling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2010 included share-based compensation of $263 million, compared to $252 million in fiscal 2009. Other Operating Expenses. Operating expenses for fiscal 2009 included a $783 million charge in connection with the Settlement and Patent License and Non-Assert Agreement with Broadcom and a $230 million fine levied by the KFTC. Net Investment Income (Loss). Net investment income was $766 million for fiscal 2010, compared to net investment loss of $139 million for fiscal 2009. The net increase was primarily comprised as follows (in millions):37 Year Ended September 26, 2010 September 27, 2009 ChangeInterest and dividend income: Corporate and other segments$522 $513 $9QSI8 3 5Interest expense(43) (13) (30)Net realized gains on investments: Corporate and other segments379 107 272QSI26 30 (4)Net impairment losses on investments: Corporate and other segments(110) (734) 624QSI(15) (29) 14Gains on derivative instruments3 1 2Equity in losses of investees(4) (17) 13 $766 $(139) $905During fiscal 2010, we recorded lower impairment losses and higher realized gains on marketable securities, compared to fiscal 2009. Depressed security values caused by a major disruption in the United States and foreign financial markets impacted our results in fiscal 2009 and continued to cause impairment losses in fiscal 2010, but to a much lesser extent. The increase in interest expense was primarily attributable to the bank loans related to the BWA spectrum won in the India auction in June 2010. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $973 million for fiscal 2010, compared to $611 million for fiscal 2009. The annual effective tax rate was 22% for fiscal 2010, compared to 25% for fiscal 2009. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was lower than fiscal 2009 primarily as a result of the net decrease in valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to capital losses and an increase in tax benefits related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, partially offset by a decrease in tax benefit related to tax audits settled during the year and a decrease in research and development tax credits. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 was 22% and only reflected the United States federal research and development credits generated through December 31, 2009, the date on which they expired. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 of 22% was less than the United States federal statutory rate primarily due to benefits of 20% related to foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate, partially offset by state taxes of 5% and tax expense of 4% related to the valuation of deferred tax assets to reflect changes in California law, primarily deferred revenue that was taxable in fiscal 2010, but for which the resulting deferred tax asset will reverse in future years when our state tax rate will be lower. Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010The following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2011 and 2010 financial results for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 10 – Segment Information.” QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2011 were $8.86 billion, compared to $6.70 billion for fiscal 2010. Equipment and services revenues, mostly related to sales of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, were $8.65 billion for fiscal 2011, compared to $6.47 billion for fiscal 2010. The increase in equipment and services revenues resulted primarily from a $1.48 billion increase related to higher unit shipments, a $391 million increase related to sales of connectivity products, primarily resulting from the acquisition of Atheros in the third quarter of fiscal 2011, and a $214 million increase related to the net effects of changes in product mix and lower selling prices of such products. Approximately 483 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2011 (excluding the second MSM for customers who built devices with two MSMs starting in fiscal 2011), compared to approximately 399 million in fiscal 2010.QCT earnings before taxes for fiscal 2011 were $2.06 billion, compared to $1.69 billion for fiscal 2010. The increase in QCT earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues, partially offset by a $358 million increase in research and development expenses and a $143 million increase in selling, general and administrative expenses. QCT operating income as a percentage of revenues (operating margin percentage) was 23% in fiscal 2011, compared to 25% in fiscal 2010. The decrease in operating margin percentage was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin percentage, partially offset by the effect of a higher increase in QCT revenues relative to the increases in research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. QCT gross margin percentage decreased as a result of the net effects of lower average selling 38prices, unfavorable product mix and higher product support costs, partially offset by a decrease in average unit costs.QCT inventories increased by 48% in fiscal 2011 from $481 million to $714 million primarily due to the addition of inventories from the acquisition of Atheros and an increase in work-in-process and finished goods related to growth of the business and the timing of inventory builds. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2011 were $5.42 billion, compared to $3.66 billion for fiscal 2010. During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we entered into agreements with two licensees to settle ongoing disputes, including an arbitration proceeding with Panasonic, and recorded $401 million in revenues related to prior quarters. The remaining $1.36 billion increase in revenues during fiscal 2011 was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA-based devices by licensees and higher average royalties per unit for CDMA-based devices, partially offset by the effect of $71 million that was included in QTL revenues in fiscal 2010 but was attributable to fiscal 2009 due to discussions regarding a license agreement that was signed in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. QTL earnings before taxes for fiscal 2011 were $4.75 billion, compared to $3.02 billion for fiscal 2010. QTL operating margin percentage was 88% in fiscal 2011, compared to 83% in fiscal 2010. The increases in QTL earnings before taxes and operating margin percentage were attributable to the 48% increase in licensing revenues relative to a 5% increase in operating expenses. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2011 were $656 million, compared to $628 million for fiscal 2010. Revenues increased primarily due to increases in QGOV and QES revenues of $27 million and $20 million, respectively, partially offset by a $23 million decrease in QIS revenues. The increase in QGOV revenues was primarily attributable to growth in customer funded development contracts, and the increase in QES revenues was primarily attributable to higher unit shipments of our asset-tracking products. The decrease in QIS revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in Brew revenues resulting from lower consumer demand. QWI loss before taxes for fiscal 2011 was $152 million, compared to earnings before taxes of $12 million for fiscal 2010. QWI operating margin percentage was negative in fiscal 2011, compared to a 1% operating margin in fiscal 2010. The decreases in QWI earnings before taxes and operating margin percentage were primarily attributable to $120 million in impairment charges related to certain assets of our Firethorn division, including $114 million in goodwill impairment, and the operating loss of our QIS division. QSI Segment. QSI loss before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 was $132 million, compared to earnings before taxes from continuing operations of $7 million for fiscal 2010. QSI earnings before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 included a $62 million gain on the sale of our Australia spectrum license. The remaining $77 million increase in QSI loss before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a $72 million increase in interest expense attributable to bank loans related to the BWA spectrum won in the India auction in June 2010.Our Segment Results for Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009The following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2010 and 2009 financial results for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements – Note 10 – Segment Information.” QCT Segment. QCT revenues for fiscal 2010 were $6.70 billion, compared to $6.14 billion for fiscal 2009. Equipment and services revenues, mostly related to sales of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, were $6.47 billion for fiscal 2010, compared to $5.93 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase in equipment and services revenues resulted primarily from a $1.25 billion increase related to higher unit shipments, partially offset by a decrease of $713 million related to the net effects of changes in product mix and the average selling prices of such products. Approximately 399 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2010, compared to approximately 317 million for fiscal 2009. The chipset volume in fiscal 2009 was impacted by the slowdown in the worldwide economy that caused contraction in the CDMA-based channel inventory and resulted in lower demand for CDMA-based MSM integrated chips.QCT earnings before taxes for fiscal 2010 were $1.69 billion, compared to $1.44 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase in QCT earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues, partially offset by an increase in research and development expenses. QCT operating income as a percentage of revenues (operating margin percentage) was 25% in fiscal 2010, compared to 23% in fiscal 2009. The increase in QCT operating margin percentage was primarily due to an increase in gross margin percentage and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues driven primarily by the increase in revenues. QCT gross margin percentage increased as a result of the net effects of a decrease in average unit costs, lower average selling prices and favorable product mix. QTL Segment. QTL revenues for fiscal 2010 were $3.66 billion, compared to $3.61 billion for fiscal 2009. Revenues in fiscal 2010 included $71 million attributable to fiscal 2009 that had previously not been recognized due to discussions regarding a license agreement that was signed in the first quarter of fiscal 2010. QTL earnings before taxes for fiscal 2010 were $3.02 billion, compared to $3.07 billion for fiscal 2009. QTL operating margin percentage was 83% in the fiscal 2010, compared to 85% in fiscal 2009. The decreases in QTL earnings before taxes and operating margin percentage were primarily attributable to a higher increase in patent-related costs relative to the increase in licensing revenues. QWI Segment. QWI revenues for fiscal 2010 were $628 million, compared to $641 million for fiscal 2009. Revenues 39decreased primarily due to a $56 million decrease in QIS revenues, partially offset by a $31 million increase in QES revenues. The decrease in QIS revenues was primarily attributable to a $39 million decrease in QChat revenues resulting from decreased development efforts under the licensing agreement with Sprint and a $16 million decrease in Brew revenues resulting from lower consumer demand. The increase in QES revenues was primarily attributable to a $58 million increase in equipment revenue resulting from higher unit shipments, partially offset by a $31 million decrease in messaging and other services revenue. QWI earnings before taxes for fiscal 2010 were $12 million, compared to $20 million for fiscal 2009. The decrease in QWI earnings before taxes was primarily attributable to the decrease in revenues, partially offset by a decrease in research and development expenses. QWI operating margin percentage was 1% in fiscal 2010, compared to 3% in fiscal 2009. The decrease in QWI operating margin percentage was primarily attributable to a decrease in QIS gross margin percentage, partially offset by the decrease in research and development expenses. QSI Segment. QSI earnings before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 were $7 million, compared to loss before taxes from continuing operations of $54 million for fiscal 2009. The increase in QSI earnings before taxes was primarily due to a $62 million gain on the sale of our Australia spectrum license.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $20.9 billion at September 25, 2011, an increase of $2.5 billion from September 26, 2010. This increase included cash provided by operating activities of $4.9 billion and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plans of $2.6 billion, partially offset by cash used to acquire Atheros of $3.1 billion, net of cash acquired. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 25, 2011 consisted of $5.7 billion held domestically and $15.2 billion held by foreign subsidiaries. Of the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries at September 25, 2011, $13.5 billion would be subject to material tax effects if repatriated. Due to tax and accounting considerations, we derive liquidity for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and investments held domestically.During fiscal 2011, we repurchased 2,878,000 shares of our common stock for $142 million. In connection with the stock repurchase program, we have three put options outstanding, with expiration dates in fiscal 2012, that may require us to repurchase an aggregate of 11,800,000 shares of our common stock upon exercise for $586 million, which would result in an average price per share of $49.64. Any shares repurchased are retired. At September 25, 2011, approximately $1.0 billion remained authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program, net of put options outstanding. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Since September 25, 2011, we have repurchased 2,046,000 shares of our common stock for $99 million. We continue to evaluate repurchases under this program subject to capital availability and our view that such repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders.We paid dividends totaling $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, or $0.81, $0.72 and $0.66 per common share, during fiscal 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. On March 8, 2011, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend per share of common stock from $0.190 to $0.215. We announced cash dividends totaling $361 million, or $0.215 per share, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, which were paid on September 23, 2011. On October 11, 2011, we announced a cash dividend of $0.215 per share on our common stock, payable on December 21, 2011 to stockholders of record as of November 23, 2011. We intend to continue to use cash dividends as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.Accounts receivable increased 36% during fiscal 2011. Days sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, were 22 days at both September 25, 2011 and September 26, 2010. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to growth in the QCT business and the accounts receivable relating to Atheros, which were acquired in the third quarter of fiscal 2011. We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and our expected cash flow generated from operations will provide us with flexibility and satisfy our working and other capital requirements over the next fiscal year and beyond based on our current business plans.•Our research and development expenditures were $3.0 billion and $2.5 billion in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively, and we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development for new technologies, applications and services for voice and data communications, primarily in the wireless industry.•Capital expenditures were $593 million and $426 million in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. We anticipate that capital expenditures will be higher in fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011, primarily due to estimated capital expenditures of more than $600 million in fiscal 2012 related to the continued construction of a new manufacturing facility in Taiwan for our QMT division. The initial phase of the facility is primarily being funded using cash held by foreign subsidiaries, and the facility is expected to be operational in fiscal 2012. Future capital expenditures may also be impacted by transactions that are currently not forecasted.40•Our purchase obligations for fiscal 2012, some of which relate to research and development activities and capital expenditures, totaled $1.9 billion at September 25, 2011.•The acquisition of Atheros was more significant than others we have made in the past. We expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions, the amounts of which could vary significantly, to open new opportunities for our technologies, obtain development resources, grow our patent portfolio or pursue new business.•The $994 million in loans related to the BWA spectrum won in India are due and payable in full in December 2012 and bear interest at an annual rate of 10%, which is based on the highest base rate among the bank lenders and reset quarterly, plus 0.25% with interest payments due monthly. As of September 25, 2011, all but one of the lenders had the right to demand prepayment of its portion of the loans outstanding on December 15, 2011 subject to sufficient prior written notice. As a result, the loans were classified as a component of current liabilities. The date by which those lenders were required to have given notice has now passed, and those lenders can no longer demand prepayment. One remaining lender can demand prepayment of its portion of the loans outstanding on February 28, 2012 ($152 million at September 25, 2011) if notice is given by December 15, 2011. In September 2011, we received a letter from the Government of India’s Department of Telecommunications (DoT) notifying us that our applications to obtain licenses to utilize the spectrum had been rejected. In response, we filed a petition with the Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal seeking to overturn this letter. If the DoT’s rejection of such applications were to be considered an event of default, the bank lenders could declare the loans due and payable immediately. We have received waivers from each of the bank lenders related to this matter until at least April 1, 2012, conditioned upon our continuing to pursue our legal rights in this matter, and agreeing that any default will be deemed cured under certain circumstances.Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).At September 25, 2011, our outstanding contractual obligations included (in millions):Contractual ObligationsPayments Due By Fiscal Period Total 2012 2013-2014 2015-2016 Beyond2016 NoExpirationDatePurchase obligations(1)$2,098 $1,923 $102 $64 $9 $—Loans payable(2)1,123 108 1,015 — — —Operating lease obligations464 116 109 58 181 —Capital lease obligations(3)395 12 25 27 331 —Equity funding commitments(4)2 — — — — 2Other long-term liabilities(5)(6)173 4 155 13 — 1Total contractual obligations$4,255 $2,163 $1,406 $162 $521 $3(1) Total purchase obligations include $1.4 billion in commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories.(2) Amounts include principal and interest. The loans are payable in Indian rupees and bear interest at an annual rate based on the highest rate among the bank lenders, which is reset quarterly, plus 0.25% (10% at September 25, 2011). One lender can demand prepayment of its portion of the loans outstanding on February 28, 2012 ($152 million at September 25, 2011) if notice is given by December 15, 2011. We have received conditional waivers from each of the bank lenders until at least April 1, 2012. As a result of these items, the due date for all or a portion of the loans payable could be accelerated.(3) Amounts represent future minimum lease payments including interest payments. Capital lease obligations are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at September 25, 2011.(4) These commitments do not have fixed funding dates and are subject to certain conditions. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed or funded under these arrangements; actual financing or funding may be in lesser amounts or not at all.(5) Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenues, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. Other long-term liabilities as presented in this table include the related current portions.(6) Our consolidated balance sheet at September 25, 2011 included a $38 million noncurrent liability for uncertain tax 41positions, all of which may result in cash payment. The future payments related to uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities.Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 25, 2011 is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9 — Commitments and Contingencies.”Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Interest Rate Risk. We invest a portion of our cash in a number of diversified investment- and non-investment-grade fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and debt mutual funds. Changes in the general level of United States interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed interest-bearing securities. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed interest-bearing securities could lose value. When the general economy weakens significantly, the credit profile, financial strength and growth prospects of certain issuers of interest-bearing securities held in our investment portfolios may deteriorate, and our interest-bearing securities may lose value either temporarily or other than temporarily. We may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs that do not perform well.The following table provides information about our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and loans payable that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows, weighted-average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates. Additionally, we have assumed that the interest-bearing securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate the securities for presentation purposes.Principal Amount by Expected MaturityAverage Interest Rates(Dollars in millions) 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter No SingleMaturity TotalFixed interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents$2,131 $— $— $— $— $— $— $2,131Interest rate0.2% Marketable securities: Investment grade$1,445 $1,273 $737 $254 $404 $522 $2,032 $6,667Interest rate1.1% 1.6% 3.2% 3.0% 3.0% 5.8% 1.5% Non-investment grade$3 $12 $30 $82 $135 $772 $12 $1,046Interest rate6.7% 7.8% 9.4% 9.4% 8.0% 8.0% 0.7% Floating interest-bearing securities: Cash and cash equivalents$2,493 $— $— $— $— $— $— $2,493Interest rate0.04% Marketable securities: Investment grade$342 $572 $566 $10 $25 $389 $574 $2,478Interest rate0.6% 0.7% 1.0% 5.5% 2.7% 8.9% 1.9% Non-investment grade$12 $60 $202 $130 $186 $923 $1,113 $2,626Interest rate6.3% 5.7% 6.3% 6.2% 5.0% 5.9% 4.5% Loans payable (1)$— $994 $— $— $— $— $— $994Floating interest rate 10.0% (1) Denominated in Indian rupees.Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are recorded at fair value. The loans payable approximate fair value. As of September 25, 2011, all but one of the lenders of the loans payable had the right to demand prepayment of its portion of the loans outstanding on December 15, 2011, subject to sufficient prior written notice. The date by which those lenders were required to have given notice has now passed, and those lenders can no longer demand prepayment. One remaining lender can demand prepayment of its portion of the loans outstanding on February 28, 2012 ($152 million at September 25, 2011) if notice is given by December 15, 2011. We have received conditional waivers from each of the bank lenders until at least April 1, 2012. As a result of these items, the due date for all or a portion of the loans payable could be accelerated.42 Equity Price Risk. We hold a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equity securities and equity commingled and exchange-traded fund shares that are subject to equity price risk. We have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size, style, industry and geography, and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual fund and exchange-traded fund shares at September 25, 2011 would cause a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of $263 million. At September 25, 2011, gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and equity mutual and exchange-traded fund shares were $70 million. Although we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary, there is a risk that we may incur net other-than-temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these securities if they do not recover in value within a reasonable period.In connection with our stock repurchase program, we may sell put options that require us to repurchase shares of our common stock at fixed prices. These written put options subject us to equity price risk. At September 25, 2011, we had three outstanding put options, enabling holders to sell 11,800,000 shares of our common stock upon exercise for approximately $586 million. The put option liabilities, with a fair value of $80 million at September 25, 2011, were included in other current liabilities. If the fair value of our common stock at September 25, 2011 decreased by 15%, the amount required to physically settle the put options would exceed the fair value of the shares by $12 million, net of the $75 million in premiums received. Foreign Exchange Risk. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties. Such derivative financial instruments are viewed as hedging or risk management tools and are not used for speculative or trading purposes. Counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major institutions. In the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us, which could have a negative impact on our results. At September 25, 2011, we had a net liability of $25 million related to foreign currency option contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain licensees on their sales of CDMA-based devices. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by 50% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in each of our hedged foreign currencies, we would incur a loss of approximately $23 million resulting from a decrease in the fair value of the portion of our hedges that would be rendered ineffective. At September 25, 2011, we had an asset of $7 million related to a foreign currency forward contract that was designated as a net investment hedge of our investment in a wholly-owned subsidiary in Australia. We are subject to market risk on such contract. If the exchange rates relevant to that contract were to change unfavorably by 20%, we would incur a loss of $11 million. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1 — The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies.At September 25, 2011, we had floating-rate bank loans in the aggregate of $994 million, which are payable in full in Indian rupees in December 2012. The loans are payable in the functional currency of our consolidated subsidiaries that are party to the loans; however, we are subject to foreign currency translation risk, which may impact our liability for principal repayment and interest expense that we will record in the future. If the foreign currency exchange rate were to change unfavorably by 20%, we would incur additional principal of $248 million and interest expense of $30 million through the remainder of the contractual terms of the loans.Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies.Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks.",2023-12-30 18:21:53.661456
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIn addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report.OverviewRecent DevelopmentsRevenues for fiscal 2012 were $19.1 billion, with net income of $6.1 billion, which were impacted by the following key items:•We shipped approximately 590 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) integrated circuits for CDMA- and OFDMA-based wireless devices, an increase of 22%, compared to approximately 483 million MSM integrated circuits in fiscal 2011. (1) •Total reported device sales were approximately $187.3 billion, an increase of approximately 25%, compared to approximately $149.5 billion in fiscal 2011. (2) •On December 27, 2011, we completed the sale of substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum for $1.9 billion, and as a result, we recognized a gain in discontinued operations of $1.2 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2012.Against this backdrop, the following recent developments occurred during fiscal 2012 with respect to key elements of our business or our industry:•Worldwide wireless connections grew by approximately 9% to reach approximately 6.4 billion. (3) •Worldwide 3G connections (all CDMA-based) grew by approximately 24% to approximately 1.8 billion, which was approximately 29% of total wireless subscriptions, including approximately 552 million CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO subscriptions and approximately 1.3 billion WCDMA/HSPA/TD-SCDMA subscriptions. (3) (1)Some customers built devices that incorporated two MSM integrated circuits. In such cases, which represent approximately 1% of our gross volume, we count only one MSM integrated circuit in reporting the MSM integrated circuit shipments.(2)Total reported device sales is the sum of all reported sales in U.S. dollars (as reported to us by our licensees) of all licensed CDMA-based, OFDMA-based and multimode CDMA/OFDMA subscriber devices (including handsets, modules, modem cards and other subscriber devices) by our licensees during a particular period (collectively, 3G/4G devices). Not all licensees report sales the same way (e.g., some licensees report sales net of permitted deductions, such as transportation, insurance and packing costs, while other licensees report sales and then identify the amount of permitted deductions in their reports), and the way in which licensees report such information may change from time to time. Total reported device sales for a particular period may include prior period activity that was not reported by the licensee until such particular period.(3)According to Wireless Intelligence estimates as of November 5, 2012, for the quarter ending September 30, 2012. Wireless Intelligence estimates for CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO connections do not include Wireless Local Loop.Our Business and Operating SegmentsWe design, manufacture, have manufactured on our behalf and market digital communications products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products, fixed license fees (payable in one or more installments) and ongoing royalties for use of our intellectual property, and fees for messaging and other services and related hardware sales, software development and licensing, and related services and software hosting services. Operating expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services revenues and research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses.We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments: QCT, QTL, QWI and QSI.QCT is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies for use in voice and data communications, networking, application processing, multimedia and global positioning system products. QCT’s integrated circuit products and system software are sold to or licensed to manufacturers that use our products in wireless devices, particularly mobile phones, tablets, laptops, data modules, handheld wireless computers and gaming devices, access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment, and in wired devices, particularly broadband gateway equipment, desktop computers, televisions and Blu-ray players. The MSM integrated circuits, which include the Mobile Data Modem, Qualcomm Single Chip and Qualcomm Snapdragon processor-based devices, perform the core baseband modem functionality in wireless devices providing voice and data communications, as well as multimedia applications and global positioning functions. In addition, our Snapdragon processors provide advanced application and 30graphics processing capabilities. QCT’s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. QCT revenues comprised 63%, 59% and 61% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have been assembled into packages or modules and have completed the final test manufacturing processes. We rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase wafers and die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party manufacturers for probe, assembly and final test services.QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD (including TD-SCDMA), GSM/GPRS/EDGE and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives. QTL licensing revenues are comprised of license fees as well as royalties based on sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g., certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.). QTL revenues comprised 33%, 36% and 33% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues were generated through our licensees’ sales of CDMA2000 and WCDMA subscriber equipment products.QWI, which includes our QES, QIS, QGOV and Firethorn divisions, generates revenues primarily through sales of products, services (including software development) and software aimed at the support and delivery of wireless applications. QES sells integrated wireless systems and services to transportation and logistics companies to manage their assets and workforce. QIS provides content enablement services for the wireless industry, including its Brew, Plaza and other products and services. QIS also provides QChat push-to-talk and other software products and services for wireless operators. QGOV provides development and other services and related products involving wireless communications technologies to government agencies and their contractors. Firethorn builds and manages software applications that enable mobile commerce services. QWI revenues comprised 3%, 4% and 6% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.QSI makes strategic investments that we believe will open new opportunities for our technologies, support the design and introduction of new products and services for voice and data communications or possess unique capabilities or technology. Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies. QSI also holds wireless spectrum, including the broadband wireless access (BWA) spectrum held by our subsidiaries (BWA subsidiaries) that were established to operate a wireless network in India. As part of our strategic investment activities, we intend to pursue various exit strategies from each of our QSI investments at some point in the future. The assets and liabilities of the BWA subsidiaries are presented as held for sale at September 30, 2012 as a result of our agreement with Bharti Airtel Limited (Bharti), which provides that Bharti’s ownership interest in the BWA subsidiaries will increase over time to 100% if certain conditions are met. In addition, the results of QSI’s FLO TV business are presented as discontinued operations and are therefore not included in QSI’s segment revenues or loss before income taxes. Nonreportable segments are comprised of display and other product and services initiatives, including our QMT division. QMT continues to develop an interferometric modulator (IMOD) display technology based on micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS) structure combined with thin film optics. During the third quarter of fiscal 2012, we updated the business plan and related internal forecasts for our QMT division to reflect a focus on licensing our next generation IMOD display technology while directly commercializing only certain IMOD products. As a result, we tested the QMT division’s goodwill and other long-lived assets for impairment and concluded that the fair value of the QMT reporting unit was greater than its carrying value and that the carrying values of QMT’s long-lived asset groups were recoverable. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, we revised our plans with respect to certain equipment comprising an asset group and recorded an impairment charge of $54 million.Discontinued OperationsOn March 27, 2011, the FLO TV business and network were shut down. On December 27, 2011, we completed the sale of substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum for $1.9 billion, and as a result, we recognized a gain in discontinued operations of $1.2 billion during the second quarter of fiscal 2012. All remaining assets have been considered disposed of since March 27, 2011, the date on which the assets ceased to be used. Since the shut down of the FLO TV business and network, we have been working to sell the remaining assets and exit contracts. Accordingly, the results of operations of the FLO TV business are 31presented as discontinued operations. Income (loss) from discontinued operations includes share-based compensation and excludes certain general corporate expenses allocated to the FLO TV business during the periods presented.Summarized results from discontinued operations were as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2012 September 25, 2011 September 26, 2010Revenues$— $5 $9Income (loss) from discontinued operations1,203 (507) (459)Income tax (expense) benefit(427) 194 186Discontinued operations, net of income taxes$776 $(313) $(273)Looking ForwardThe deployment of 3G networks enables increased voice capacity and higher data rates than prior generation networks, thereby supporting more minutes of use and a wide range of mobile broadband data applications for handsets, 3G connected computing devices and other consumer electronics. According to the Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA), as of November 2012, to complement their existing 3G networks, more than 110 wireless operators have deployed and more than 300 wireless operators are planning to deploy OFDMA-based technology, often called 4G, in new wireless spectrum to gain additional capacity for data services. As a result, we expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for 3G and 3G/4G multimode products and services around the world. In addition, we expect an increasing number of devices, such as computers, consumer electronics and networking equipment, to require multiple communications technologies to support a variety of connected applications.As we look forward to the next several months, the following items are likely to have an impact on our business:•The worldwide transition from 2G to 3G and 3G/4G networks is expected to continue, including the further expansion of 3G in China, India and other emerging regions. We expect that the emergence of lower-end smartphone products will contribute to such expansion.•We expect consumer demand for advanced 3G and 3G/4G multimode devices, including smartphones and data-centric devices, such as tablets and e-readers, to continue at a strong pace.•We expect that CDMA-based device prices will continue to vary broadly due to the increased penetration of smartphones combined with active competition throughout the world at all price tiers. Additionally, varying rates of economic growth by region and stronger growth of CDMA-based device shipments in emerging regions, as compared to developed regions, are expected to continue to impact the average and range of selling prices of CDMA-based devices.•We continue to invest significant resources toward the development of technologies and products for voice and data communications, primarily in the wireless industry, including advancements to 3G and 4G LTE (an OFDMA-based standard) networks, wireless baseband chips, our converged computing/communications (Snapdragon) chips, multimedia products, software and services, as well as our IMOD and other display technologies.•We expect industry demand for 28 nanometer integrated circuits to continue to be strong. Accordingly, even as we continue to increase our supply of 28 nanometer integrated circuits, we may still experience supply shortages for our 28 nanometer integrated circuit products during the early part of fiscal 2013. Our QCT business anticipates a strong first quarter in fiscal 2013 as the supply of 28 nanometer integrated circuits increases and as new 3G and 3G/4G devices are launched for the holiday season.In addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry. However, we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. We expect that such companies will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world.Further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the Risk Factors included in this Annual Report.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United 32States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets and investments, share-based compensation, income taxes and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Although we believe that our estimates and the assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the following significant accounting estimates may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others.Revenue Recognition. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products, licensing of our intellectual property and software, and sales of messaging, software hosting, software development and other services and related hardware. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations. We license or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Licensing revenues include license fees (payable in one or more installments) and ongoing royalties based on licensees’ sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee, typically 5 to 15 years. From time to time, licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal disputes or other reasons, and when this occurs, the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected.Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. We also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions. At September 30, 2012, our goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $3.9 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. For intangible assets purchased in a business combination or received in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets received (or, for non-monetary exchanges, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values, except when neither the values of the assets received or the assets transferred in non-monetary exchanges are determinable within reasonable limits. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. An estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions that require significant judgment. For example, the income approach generally requires assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows, total addressable market, pricing and share forecasts, competition, technology obsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of certain assets may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models. New information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill and other intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on a portion or all of our goodwill and other intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. During fiscal 2012 and 2011, we recorded $23 million and $114 million, respectively, in goodwill impairment charges related to our Firethorn division due to the operating performance of new product applications falling significantly short of expectations.We hold investments in marketable securities, including equity securities, non-investment-grade debt securities, equity and debt mutual and exchange-traded funds, corporate bonds and notes, auction rate securities and mortgage- and asset-backed securities. The fair value of these investments totaled $23 billion at September 30, 2012, with increases and decreases in fair value generally recorded through stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income or loss. We record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The 33determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. In addition, the fair values of our strategic investments may be subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring impairment charges. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost; how long the market value of the investment has been below its original cost; the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default or recovery rates of securities in an asset class; negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others; the performance and pricing of the investee’s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the industry and the market in general; and analyst recommendations, as applicable. We also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, we may record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, we recorded $71 million, $39 million and $111 million, respectively, in net impairment losses on our investments in marketable securities.Share-Based Compensation. Share-based compensation expense recognized during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $1.0 billion, $821 million and $614 million, respectively. Share-based compensation is measured at the grant date, or at the acquisition date for assumed awards, based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period. We estimate the fair value of stock option awards granted using a lattice binomial option-pricing model and the fair value of stock option awards assumed using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Accordingly, the fair value of an option award as determined using an option-pricing model is affected by our stock price on the valuation date as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables. These variables include, but are not limited to, our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors, risk-free interest rates and expected dividends. For purposes of estimating the fair value of stock options, we used the implied volatility of market-traded options in our stock for the expected volatility assumption input to the option-pricing model. The assumption inputs related to employee exercise behavior include estimates of the post-vest forfeiture rate and suboptimal exercise factors, which are based on historical experience. Beginning in fiscal 2010, we began to issue restricted stock units (RSUs) to employees. Since such time, the number of stock options granted to employees has decreased, and we expect this trend to continue into the foreseeable future. We estimate the fair value of RSUs based on the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant or date the awards are assumed. If RSUs do not have the right to participate in dividends, the fair value is discounted by the dividend yield. Judgment is required in estimating the amount of share-based awards that are expected to be forfeited. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. To the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate, share-based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly.Income Taxes. Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. We are participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the IRS on the treatment of all issues prior to filing our federal return. A benefit of participation in this program is that post-filing adjustments by the IRS are less likely to occur.We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. At September 30, 2012, net deferred tax assets were $1.7 billion, which included a valuation allowance of $142 million. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results.We can only use net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in certain tax jurisdictions. At September 30, 2012, we had unused federal, state and foreign net operating losses of $154 million, $591 million and $41 million, respectively. Based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities, we expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal 2012. Therefore, we have provided a $27 million valuation 34allowance for these net operating losses. Significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made.During fiscal 2012, we established our QCT segment’s non-United States headquarters in Singapore. We obtained tax incentives in Singapore, including a tax exemption for the first five years provided that we meet specified employment and incentive criteria in Singapore. The location of QCT’s headquarters in Singapore will not result in any change in foreign tax during the first five years, as compared to tax that would be owed under the previous structure of QCT’s non-United States operations. Our Singapore tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal 2017 and again in fiscal 2027 as a result of expiration of these incentives.We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $5.8 billion related to the United States federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $16.4 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States.Litigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves. However, the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations.

Our margin percentage may fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of products sold and services provided, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors. 35 Year Ended September 30, 2012 September 25, 2011 September 26, 2010 2012 vs. 2011 Change 2011 vs. 2010 ChangeResearch and development$3,915 $2,995 $2,451 $920 $544% of revenues20% 20% 22% Selling, general, and administrative2,324 1,945 1,503 379 442% of revenues12% 13% 14% Other104 114 — (10) 114The dollar increases in research and development expenses in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were primarily attributable to increases of $741 million and $403 million, respectively, in costs related to the development of CDMA-based 3G, OFDMA-based 4G LTE and other technologies for integrated circuit and related software products and to expand our intellectual property portfolio and increases of $149 million and $104 million, respectively, in share-based compensation. Remaining dollar increases were related to development of our display technologies, other new product initiatives and our services businesses. The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to a $96 million increase in employee-related expenses, a $77 million increase in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, a $65 million increase in share-based compensation, a $54 million long-lived asset impairment charge related to our QMT division, a $45 million increase in selling and marketing expenses and a $28 million increase in patent-related expenses, partially offset by a $55 million decrease in charitable contributions (primarily related to the establishment and initial funding of the Qualcomm Charitable Foundation in fiscal 2011). The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2011 was primarily attributable to a $142 million increase in employee-related expenses, an $86 million increase in share-based compensation, a $66 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense (primarily attributable to the acquisition of Atheros), the effect of a $62 million gain on the sale of our Australia spectrum license recorded in fiscal 2010 and a $44 million increase in charitable contributions (primarily related to the establishment and initial funding of the Qualcomm Charitable Foundation in fiscal 2011).Other operating expenses in fiscal 2012 were comprised of an $81 million charge related to a payment made to the Indian government concurrent with the issuance of the BWA spectrum license and $23 million in goodwill impairment charges related to our Firethorn division. Other operating expenses in fiscal 2011 were comprised of a $114 million goodwill impairment charge related to our Firethorn division.

Interest expense in fiscal 2012 and 2011 was primarily attributable to loans and debentures related to the BWA spectrum won in the India auction in June 2010. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2012 resulted primarily from the fact that we did not capitalize interest during fiscal 2011, compared to $29 million of interest capitalized during fiscal 2012. The increase in gains on derivative instruments in fiscal 2012 primarily resulted from changes in the fair value of put options sold in 36connection with our stock repurchase program which have expired. The decrease in net impairment losses on investments in fiscal 2011 was due to an overall increase in marketable securities values compared to fiscal 2010.

The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 only reflected the United States federal research and development credit generated through December 31, 2011, the date on which the credit expired. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflected tax benefits of $44 million related to an agreement reached on a component of our fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2010 state tax returns and $32 million related to fiscal 2010 resulting from the retroactive extension of the United States federal research and development tax credit. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 reflected the United States federal research and development credits generated through December 31, 2009, the date on which they expired, and a tax expense of approximately $137 million that arose because certain deferred revenue was taxable in fiscal 2010, but the resulting deferred tax asset is reversing in subsequent years in which our effective state tax rate is lower as a result of California tax legislation previously enacted. Our Segment Results (in millions)The following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010 financial results for each reporting segment.

Equipment and services revenues, mostly related to sales of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, were $11.91 billion, $8.65 billion and $6.47 billion in fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increases in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2012 and 2011 resulted primarily from increases of $1.71 billion and $1.23 billion, respectively, related to higher unit shipments, increases of $803 million and $391 million, respectively, related to sales of connectivity products (primarily resulting from the acquisition of Atheros in the third quarter of fiscal 2011) and increases of $651 million and $461 million, respectively, related to the net effects of changes in product mix and lower selling prices of such products.(1) Approximately 590 million, 483 million and 399 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively (excluding the second MSM for customers who built devices with two MSMs starting in fiscal 2011).The decreases in EBT as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2012 and 2011 were primarily due to decreases in gross margin percentage, partially offset by the effects of higher increases in QCT revenues relative to the increases in research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. QCT gross margin percentage decreased in fiscal 2012 and 2011 as a result of the net effects of lower average selling prices, unfavorable product mix and higher product support costs, partially offset by a decrease in average unit costs. The higher product support costs in fiscal 2012 primarily related to increased expenses incurred to facilitate additional supply of 28 nanometer integrated circuits.QCT inventories increased by 36% in fiscal 2012 from $714 million to $973 million primarily due to an increase in work-in-process and finished goods related to growth of the business.(1)During fiscal 2012, we updated the method we use to quantify the dollar impact of changes in QCT unit shipments as compared to the impact of changes in product mix and changes in product prices. The information presented for the fiscal 2011 increase reflects the updated method.QTL Segment. During the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we entered into agreements with two licensees to settle ongoing disputes, including an arbitration proceeding with Panasonic, and recorded $401 million in revenues related to prior quarters. The $1.31 billion and $1.36 billion increases in revenues, excluding the $401 million effect of these settlements, in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively, were primarily due to increases in sales of CDMA-based devices by licensees and higher average royalties per unit for CDMA-based devices. The increases in QTL earnings before taxes and operating margin percentage in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 were attributable to the 48% increase in licensing revenue relative to a 5% increase in operating expenses.QWI Segment. The decrease in QWI revenues in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to a $25 million decrease in QES revenues resulting from lower shipments of mobile information units and lower services revenues. The increase in QWI revenues in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to increases in QGOV and QES revenues of $27 million and $20 million, respectively, partially offset by a $23 million decrease in QIS revenues. The increase in QGOV revenues was primarily attributable to growth in customer funded development contracts, and the increase in QES revenues was primarily attributable to higher shipments of our mobile information units. The decrease in QIS revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in Brew revenues resulting from lower consumer demand.QWI operating expenses in fiscal 2012 and 2011 included $23 million and $114 million, respectively, of goodwill impairment charges related to our Firethorn division. The $46 million increase in QWI earnings before taxes in fiscal 2012, excluding the impairment charges, was primarily attributable to a $26 million decrease in Firethorn operating loss (before the impairment charges) and a $25 million decrease in QIS operating loss. The $50 million decrease in QWI earnings before taxes in fiscal 2011, excluding the impairment charge, was primarily attributable to the operating loss of our QIS division.QSI Segment. QSI operating expenses for fiscal 2012 included $81 million related to a payment made to the Indian government concurrent with issuance of the BWA spectrum license. The $43 million decrease in QSI loss before taxes from continuing operations in fiscal 2012, excluding this charge, was primarily attributable to a $40 million increase in net realized gains on investments and a $20 million decrease in interest expense as a result of capitalizing interest starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 related to the BWA network in India. QSI earnings before taxes from continuing operations for fiscal 2010 included a $62 million gain on the sale of our Australia spectrum license. The remaining $77 million increase in QSI loss before taxes from continuing operations in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a $72 million increase in interest expense attributable to loans related to the BWA spectrum won in the India auction in June 2010.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $26.8 billion at September 30, 2012, an increase of $5.9 billion from September 25, 2011. This increase included $1.9 billion in proceeds from the sale of substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum and $1.7 billion in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plans. Our cash, cash 38equivalents and marketable securities at September 30, 2012 consisted of $9.8 billion held domestically and $17.0 billion held by foreign subsidiaries. Of the amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our foreign subsidiaries at September 30, 2012, $16.4 billion is indefinitely reinvested and would be subject to material tax effects if repatriated. Due to tax and accounting considerations, we derive liquidity for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and investments held domestically. Total cash provided by operating activities increased to $6.0 billion during fiscal 2012, compared to $4.9 billion during fiscal 2011.During fiscal 2012, we repurchased and retired 23,893,000 shares of common stock for $1.3 billion, before commissions. At September 30, 2012, approximately $2.8 billion remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program. Since September 30, 2012, we repurchased and retired 4,132,000 shares of common stock for $240 million. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. We continue to evaluate repurchases as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to our periodic determinations that repurchases are in the best interest of our stockholders.We paid dividends totaling $1.6 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, or $0.93, $0.81 and $0.72 per common share, during fiscal 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. On March 6, 2012, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.215 to $0.25 per share of common stock. We announced cash dividends totaling $426 million, or $0.25 per share, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012, which were paid on September 26, 2012. On October 17, 2012, we announced a cash dividend of $0.25 per share of common stock, payable on December 21, 2012 to stockholders of record as of December 7, 2012. We intend to continue to use cash dividends as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.Accounts receivable increased 47% during fiscal 2012. Days sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, were 29 days at September 30, 2012, compared to 22 days at September 25, 2011. The increase in accounts receivable and the related days sales outstanding were primarily due to growth of the business and the effects of timing of shipments and customer payments for receivables related to integrated circuits.We believe our current cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and our expected cash flow generated from operations will provide us with flexibility and satisfy our working and other capital requirements over the next fiscal year and beyond based on our current business plans.•Our research and development expenditures were $3.9 billion and $3.0 billion in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively, and we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development for new technologies, applications and services for voice and data communications, primarily in the wireless industry.•Cash outflows for capital expenditures were $1.3 billion and $593 million in fiscal 2012 and 2011, respectively, including approximately $480 million and $225 million, respectively, related to the construction of a new manufacturing facility in Taiwan for our QMT division. We expect to continue to incur capital expenditures in the future to support our business, including research and development activities. Future capital expenditures may be impacted by transactions that are currently not forecasted.•Our purchase obligations for fiscal 2013, some of which relate to research and development activities and capital expenditures, totaled $3.1 billion at September 30, 2012.•The acquisition of Atheros in fiscal 2011 was more significant than others we have made in the past. We expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions, the amounts of which could vary significantly, to open new opportunities for our technologies, obtain development resources, grow our patent portfolio or pursue new business.•At September 30, 2012, we have loan and debenture liabilities in the aggregate of $1.1 billion, which were classified as held for sale, related to the BWA spectrum won in India that are denominated in Indian rupees. At September 30, 2012, loans in the aggregate of $545 million are due and payable in full on December 18, 2012, and $519 million in debentures, including accrued interest, are due and payable in full on June 25, 2017. We intend to refinance the loans with long-term loans on or before December 18, 2012. Each holder has the right to demand redemption of its portion of the debentures outstanding on June 25, 2013 subject to sufficient prior written notice. As a result, the debentures were classified as current liabilities. The loans bear interest at rates that are reset quarterly (ranging from 10.00% to 10.50% at September 30, 2012); interest payments are due monthly. The debentures bear interest at an agreed-upon annual rate, which is compounded annually and reset semi-annually beginning on June 25, 2013 (10.25% at September 30, 2012) with interest due upon redemption. Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).At September 30, 2012, our outstanding contractual obligations included (in millions):39Contractual ObligationsPayments Due By Fiscal Period Total 2013 2014-2015 2016-2017 Beyond2017 NoExpirationDatePurchase obligations (1)$3,616 $3,053 $521 $32 $10 $—Loans and debentures (2)1,064 1,064 — — — —Operating lease obligations444 131 170 73 70 —Capital lease obligations (3)134 5 9 10 110 —Equity funding commitments (4)2 — — — — 2Other long-term liabilities (5)(6)52 — 44 5 1 2Total contractual obligations$5,312 $4,253 $744 $120 $191 $4(1)Total purchase obligations include $3.1 billion in commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories.(2)Amounts include principal and interest. The loans and debentures are payable in Indian rupees. The majority of the loans ($468 million at September 30, 2012) bear interest at an annual rate based on the highest rate among the bank lenders, which is reset quarterly, plus 0.25% (10.00% at September 30, 2012) with interest payments due monthly. The remaining loan ($77 million at September 30, 2012) bears interest at an annual rate based on the highest rate of the bank that is party to the loan or of the other bank lenders, which is reset quarterly, plus 0.25% (10.50% at September 30, 2012) with interest payments due monthly. All of the loans are due and payable in full on December 18, 2012; we intend to refinance the loans with long-term loans on or before that date. The debentures bear interest at an agreed-upon annual rate, which is compounded annually and reset semi-annually beginning on June 25, 2013 (10.25% at September 30, 2012) with interest due upon redemption. The debentures can be redeemed by us without penalty on certain dates. Additionally, each holder has the right to demand redemption of its portion of the debentures outstanding on June 25, 2013 subject to sufficient prior written notice. (3)Amounts represent future minimum lease payments including interest payments. Capital lease obligations are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2012.(4) These commitments do not have fixed funding dates and are subject to certain conditions. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed or funded under these arrangements; actual financing or funding may be in lesser amounts or not at all.(5)Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenues, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. Other long-term liabilities as presented in this table include the related current portions.(6)Our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2012 included an $82 million noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions, all of which may result in cash payment. The future payments related to uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities.Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 30, 2012 is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn June 2011, the Financial Accounting Standards Board revised the authoritative guidance for comprehensive income to require an entity to present total comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements and eliminated the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of stockholders’ equity. The guidance will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2013 and will be applied retrospectively. The adoption of the guidance will impact the presentation of the financial statements but will not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskInterest Rate Risk. We invest a portion of our cash in a number of diversified investment- and non-investment-grade fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, debt funds and derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps. Changes in the general level of United States interest rates can affect the principal values and yields of fixed interest-bearing securities and the fair value of interest rate swaps held in connection with our marketable securities portfolios classified as trading. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise rapidly in a short period of time, our fixed interest-bearing securities could lose value. When the general economy weakens significantly, the credit profile, financial strength and growth prospects of certain issuers of interest-bearing securities held in our investment portfolios may deteriorate, and our interest-bearing securities may lose value either temporarily or other than temporarily. We may implement investment strategies of different types with varying duration and risk/return trade-offs that do not perform well.40The following table provides information about our interest-bearing cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities and loans and debentures that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents principal cash flows, weighted-average yield at cost and contractual maturity dates. We have assumed that the interest-bearing securities are similar enough within the specified categories to aggregate the securities for presentation purposes. Additionally, the table provides information about our derivative instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For such securities, the table presents the notional amount, weighted-average yield and contractual maturity.

The loans and debentures approximate fair value. The debentures can be redeemed by us without penalty on certain dates. Additionally, each holder has the right to demand redemption of its portion of the debentures outstanding on June 25, 2013 subject to sufficient prior written notice.Equity Price Risk. We hold a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equity securities and fund shares that are subject to equity price risk. We have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size, style, industry and geography, and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and fund shares at September 30, 2012 would cause a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of $321 million. At September 30, 2012, gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and fund shares were $14 million. Although we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary, there is a risk that we may incur net other-than-temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these securities if they do 41not recover in value within a reasonable period.Foreign Exchange Risk. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties. We utilize such derivative financial instruments for hedging or risk management purposes rather than for speculation purposes. Counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major institutions. In the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us, which could have a negative impact on our results.At September 30, 2012, we had a net asset of $1 million related to foreign currency option contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain licensees on their sales of CDMA-based devices. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in our hedged foreign currency, we would not incur a loss. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies.At September 30, 2012, we had a net asset of $4 million related to foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on intercompany payments of operating expenditures relating to a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary. If our forecasted operating expenditures were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in each of our hedged foreign currencies, we would not incur a loss. At September 30, 2012, we had a net liability that was negligible related to foreign currency forwards, futures, options and swaps that were not designated as hedging instruments related to our marketable securities portfolios classified as trading. If the foreign exchange rates relevant to these contracts were to change unfavorably by 10% and we do not have an offset foreign currency exposure relating to debt instruments held in our marketable securities portfolios classified as trading, we would incur a loss of $2 million. At September 30, 2012, we had floating-rate bank loans and debentures in the aggregate of $1.1 billion, which are payable in full in Indian rupees in December 2012 and June 2017, respectively. The loans and debentures are payable in the functional currency of our consolidated subsidiaries that are party to the loans and debentures; however, we are subject to foreign currency translation risk, which may impact our liability for principal repayment and interest expense that we will record in the future. If the foreign currency exchange rate were to change unfavorably by 20%, we would incur additional principal of $262 million and interest cost of $12 million through the remainder of the contractual terms of the loans and debentures.Financial instruments held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global concern, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies.Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks.",2023-12-30 18:21:52.910948
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2013,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIn addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report.OverviewRecent DevelopmentsRevenues for fiscal 2013 were $24.9 billion, with net income attributable to Qualcomm of $6.9 billion, which primarily resulted from the following key items:•We shipped approximately 716 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) integrated circuits for CDMA- and OFDMA-based wireless devices, an increase of 21%, compared to approximately 590 million MSM integrated circuits in fiscal 2012.•Total reported device sales were approximately $231.2 billion, an increase of approximately 23%, compared to approximately $187.3 billion in fiscal 2012. (1) Against this backdrop, the following recent developments occurred during fiscal 2013 with respect to key elements of our business or our industry:•Worldwide cellular connections grew by approximately 6% to reach approximately 6.8 billion. (2) •Worldwide 3G connections (all CDMA-based) grew by approximately 18% to approximately 2.2 billion, which was approximately 32% of total cellular subscriptions, including approximately 0.5 billion CDMA2000 1X/1xEV-DO subscriptions and approximately 1.7 billion WCDMA/HSPA/TD-SCDMA subscriptions. (2) (1)Total reported device sales is the sum of all reported sales in U.S. dollars (as reported to us by our licensees) of all licensed CDMA-based, OFDMA-based and CDMA/OFDMA multimode subscriber devices (including handsets, modules, modem cards and other subscriber devices) by our licensees during a particular period (collectively, 3G/4G devices). Not all licensees report sales the same way (e.g., some licensees report sales net of permitted deductions, including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items, while other licensees report sales and then identify the amount of permitted deductions in their reports), and the way in which licensees report such information may change from time to time. Total reported device sales for a particular period may include prior period activity that was not reported by the licensee until such particular period.(2)According to GSMA Intelligence estimates as of November 4, 2013, for the quarter ended September 30, 2013 (estimates excluded Wireless Local Loop). Our Business and Operating SegmentsWe design, manufacture, have manufactured on our behalf and market digital communications products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products, fixed license fees (payable in one or more installments) and ongoing royalties for use of our intellectual property, and fees for messaging and other services and related hardware sales, software development and licensing, and related services and software hosting services. Costs and expenses primarily consist of cost of equipment and services revenues and research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses.We conduct business primarily through four reportable segments: QCT, QTL, QWI and QSI. Our reportable segments are operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. At the beginning of fiscal 2013, we completed a corporate reorganization in which certain assets of QUALCOMM Incorporated, as well as the stock of certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, were contributed to its wholly-owned subsidiary Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI). QTL continues to be operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which continues to own the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by QTI and its subsidiaries. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies for use in voice and data communications, networking, application processing, multimedia and global positioning system products. QCT’s integrated circuit products and system software are sold to or licensed to manufacturers that use our products in wireless devices, particularly mobile phones, tablets, laptops, data modules, handheld wireless computers and gaming devices, access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment, and in wired devices, particularly broadband gateway equipment, desktop computers, televisions, set-top boxes and Blu-ray players. The MSM integrated circuits, which include the Mobile Data Modem, Qualcomm Single Chip and Qualcomm 30Snapdragon processor devices, perform the core baseband modem functionality in wireless devices providing voice and data communications, as well as multimedia applications and global positioning functions. In addition, our Snapdragon processors provide advanced application and graphics processing capabilities. QCT’s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. QCT revenues comprised 67%, 63% and 59% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have been assembled into packages or modules and have completed the final test manufacturing processes. We rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase wafers and die from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party suppliers for probe, assembly and test services.QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD (including TD-SCDMA), GSM/GPRS/EDGE and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives. QTL licensing revenues are comprised of license fees as well as royalties based on sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (e.g., certain shipping costs, packing costs, VAT, etc.). QTL recognizes royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met. Licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter. QTL revenues comprised 30%, 33% and 36% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues were generated through our licensees’ sales of CDMA2000- and WCDMA-based products, such as feature phones and smartphones.QWI (Qualcomm Wireless & Internet), which includes our Omnitracs, QIS, QGOV and QRS divisions, generates revenues primarily through sales of products, services (including software development) and software aimed at the support and delivery of wireless applications. Omnitracs sells integrated wireless systems and services to transportation and logistics companies to manage their assets and workforce. On August 21, 2013, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we agreed to sell the North and Latin American operations of Omnitracs to a U.S.-based private equity firm for $800 million in cash, subject to the terms and conditions of the definitive agreement. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. We expect to record the gain on sale, net of income taxes, as a discontinued operation upon close. However, the revenues and operating results were not presented as a discontinued operation in any fiscal period because they were immaterial. QIS (Qualcomm Internet Services) provides content enablement services for the wireless industry, including its Brew, Plaza and other products and services. QIS also provides QChat push-to-talk and other software products and services for wireless operators. QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) provides development and other services and related products involving wireless communications technologies to government agencies and their contractors. QRS (Qualcomm Retail Solutions) builds and manages software applications that enable certain mobile location-awareness and commerce services. QWI revenues comprised 2%, 3% and 4% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) makes strategic investments that we believe may open new or expand opportunities for our technologies, support the design and introduction of new products and services for voice and data communications or possess unique capabilities or technology. Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies. QSI also holds wireless spectrum. As part of our strategic investment activities, we intend to pursue various exit strategies from each of our QSI investments at some point in the future. During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we deconsolidated subsidiaries that were established to operate a wireless network in India using broadband wireless access spectrum (the BWA subsidiaries) due to events that resulted in a change in control of these subsidiaries. The former BWA subsidiaries were merged into one entity on August 5, 2013, and on October 17, 2013, all of our interest in the remaining former subsidiary was sold.Nonreportable segments are comprised of our QMT (Qualcomm MEMS Technologies) division and other display, wireless technology and service initiatives that include, but are not limited to: low power consumption, high optical performance flat display modules; medical device connectivity and related data management; augmented reality; and device-to-device communication. QMT continues to develop an interferometric modulator (IMOD) display technology based on micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) structure combined with thin film optics. 31Discontinued OperationsOn March 27, 2011, the FLO TV business and network were shut down. On December 27, 2011, we completed the sale of substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum for $1.9 billion, and as a result, we recognized a gain in discontinued operations of $1.2 billion during fiscal 2012. The results of the discontinued FLO TV operations were as follows (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2012 September 25, 2011Revenues$— $5Income (loss) from discontinued operations$1,203 $(507)Income tax (expense) benefit(427) 194Discontinued operations, net of income taxes$776 $(313)Looking ForwardThe deployment of 3G networks has enabled increased voice capacity and higher data rates than prior generation networks, thereby supporting more minutes of use and a wide range of mobile broadband data applications for handsets, 3G connected computing devices and other consumer electronics. According to the Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA), as of October 2013, to complement their existing 3G networks, more than 220 wireless operators have deployed and more than 420 wireless operators are planning to deploy OFDMA-based technology, often called 4G, in new wireless spectrum to gain additional capacity for data services. As a result, we expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for 3G and 3G/4G multimode products and services around the world. As we look forward to the next several months, the following items are likely to have an impact on our business:•The worldwide transition from 2G to 3G and 3G/4G networks is expected to continue, including the further expansion of 3G in emerging regions, such as China. We expect that the growth of low-tier smartphone products will contribute to such expansion.•We expect consumer demand for advanced 3G and 3G/4G multimode devices, including smartphones and data-centric devices, to continue at a strong pace.•We expect that CDMA-based device prices will continue to vary broadly due to the increased penetration of smartphones combined with active competition throughout the world at all price tiers. Additionally, varying rates of economic growth by region and stronger growth of CDMA-based device shipments in emerging regions, as compared to developed regions, are expected to continue to impact the average and range of selling prices of CDMA-based devices.•We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements to 3G, 3G/4G and 4G LTE (an OFDMA-based standard) technologies, audio and video codecs, wireless baseband chips, our converged computing/communications (Snapdragon) chips, multimedia products, software and services. We are also investing across a broad spectrum of opportunities that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and enter into new industry segments, such as our IMOD and other display technologies; 3G/LTE and Wi-Fi products designed for implementation of small cells and the 1000x data challenge; wireless charging; proximity-based communications; very high speed connectivity; mobile location awareness and commerce; mobile health; wearable technology; gaming; and products for the connected home, the digital 6th sense and the Internet of Everything.In addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry. However, we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. We expect that such companies will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world.Further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the Risk Factors included in this Annual Report.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, 32we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to revenue recognition, valuation of intangible assets and investments, income taxes and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Although we believe that our estimates and the assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the following significant accounting estimates may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others.Revenue Recognition. We derive revenue principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing of our intellectual property. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our deliverables and obligations. We license or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Licensing revenues include license fees (payable in one or more installments) and ongoing royalties based on licensees’ sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. License fees are recognized over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee, typically 5 to 15 years. From time to time, licensees will not report royalties timely due to legal disputes or other reasons, and when this occurs, the timing and comparability of royalty revenues could be affected.Valuation of Intangible Assets and Investments. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. We also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions. At September 29, 2013, our goodwill and other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, were $4.0 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. For intangible assets purchased in a business combination, the estimated fair values of the assets received are used to establish their recorded values. For intangible assets acquired in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred (or the estimated fair values of the assets received, if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values, unless the values of neither the assets received nor the assets transferred are determinable within reasonable limits, in which case the assets received are measured based on the carrying values of the assets transferred. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. An estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions that require significant judgment. For example, the income approach generally requires assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows, total addressable market, pricing and share forecasts, competition, technology obsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of certain assets may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models. New information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. Long-lived assets, such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill and other intangible assets are based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions and other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on a portion or all of our goodwill and other intangible assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. During fiscal 2013 and 2012, we recorded $158 million and $54 million, respectively, in impairment charges resulting from revisions to our estimates of expected cash flows for certain long-lived assets of our QMT division as we continue to pursue our licensing model.We hold investments in marketable securities, including U.S. treasury and government-related securities, corporate bonds and notes, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, auction rate securities, common and preferred stock and equity and debt funds. The fair value of these investments totaled $23.3 billion at September 29, 2013, with increases and decreases in fair value generally recorded through stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income or loss. We record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. In addition, the fair values of our strategic investments may be subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to significant market volatility. 33Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring impairment charges. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, how significant the decline in value is as a percentage of the original cost; how long the market value of the investment has been below its original cost; the extent of the general decline in prices or an increase in the default or recovery rates of securities in an asset class; negative events such as a bankruptcy filing or a need to raise capital or seek financial support from the government or others; the performance and pricing of the investee’s securities in relation to the securities of its competitors within the industry and the market in general; and analyst recommendations, as applicable. We also review the financial statements of the investee to determine if the investee is experiencing financial difficulties. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, we record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recorded $72 million, $71 million and $39 million, respectively, in net impairment losses on our investments in marketable securities.Income Taxes. Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. We are participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the IRS on the treatment of all issues prior to filing our federal return. A benefit of participation in this program is that post-filing adjustments by the IRS are less likely to occur.We regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the implementation of tax-planning strategies. At September 29, 2013, net deferred tax assets were $1.6 billion, which included a valuation allowance of $51 million. If we are unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions, or if there is a material change in the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, we could be required to increase the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets, which could result in an increase in our effective tax rate and an adverse impact on operating results.We can only use net operating losses to offset taxable income of certain legal entities in certain tax jurisdictions. At September 29, 2013, we had unused federal, state and foreign net operating losses of $131 million, $604 million and $75 million, respectively. Based upon our assessments of projected future taxable income and losses and historical losses incurred by these entities, we expect that the future taxable income of the entities in these tax jurisdictions will not be sufficient to utilize the net operating losses we have incurred through fiscal 2013. Therefore, we have provided a $32 million valuation allowance for these net operating losses. Significant judgment is required to forecast the timing and amount of future taxable income in certain jurisdictions. Adjustments to our valuation allowance based on changes to our forecast of taxable income are reflected in the period the change is made.Our QCT segment’s non-United States headquarters is located in Singapore. We obtained tax incentives in Singapore, including a tax exemption for the first five years, provided that we meet specified employment and incentive criteria, and as a result of expiration of these incentives, our Singapore tax rate will increase in fiscal 2017 and again in fiscal 2027.We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested outside the United States based on estimates that future domestic cash generation will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $7.6 billion related to the United States federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $21.6 billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries indefinitely invested outside the United States. Should we decide to repatriate the foreign earnings, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the United States.Litigation. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves. However, the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. We estimate the range of liability related to pending litigation where the amount and range of loss can be estimated. We record our best estimate of a loss when the loss is considered probable. Where a liability is probable and there is a range of estimated loss with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability related to the claim. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability 34related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations.

The increases in licensing revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012 were primarily due to increases in QTL revenues of $1.23 billion and $905 million, respectively.QCT and QTL segment revenues related to the products of Samsung Electronics and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd/Foxconn, its affiliates and other suppliers to Apple Inc. comprised 43% and 38% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. QCT and QTL segment revenues from Samsung Electronics and HTC comprised 26% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2011.Revenues from customers in China, South Korea and Taiwan comprised 49%, 20% and 11%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2013, as compared to 42%, 22%, and 14%, respectively, for fiscal 2012, and 32%, 19% and 17%, for fiscal 2011. We distinguish revenues from external customers by geographic areas based on the location to which our products, software or services are delivered or, for QTL licensing revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees.Costs and Expenses (in millions)Year Ended September 29, 2013 September 30, 2012 September 25, 2011 2013 vs. 2012 Change 2012 vs. 2011 ChangeCost of equipment and services (E&S) revenues$9,820$7,096$4,877 $2,724 $2,219Cost as % of E&S revenues58% 57% 53% The decreases in margin percentage in fiscal 2013 and 2012 were primarily attributable to decreases in QCT gross margin percentage. Our margin percentage may continue to fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of products sold and services provided, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors.

Remaining dollar increases were related to research and development of other new product and licensing initiatives. The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to a $113 million increase in employee-related expenses, a $56 million increase in selling and marketing expenses, a $40 million increase in patent-related expenses and a $29 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a decrease of $23 million in share-based compensation. The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2012 was primarily attributable to a $96 million increase in employee-related expenses, a $77 million increase in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, a $65 million increase in share-based compensation, a $45 million increase in selling and marketing expenses and a $28 million increase in patent-related expenses, partially offset by a $55 million decrease in charitable contributions (primarily related to the establishment and initial funding of the Qualcomm Charitable Foundation in fiscal 2011). 35Other expenses in fiscal 2013 were comprised of a $173 million charge resulting from the ParkerVision verdict against us and a $158 million impairment charge resulting from revisions to our estimates of expected cash flows for certain long-lived assets of our QMT division as we continue to pursue our licensing model. Other expenses in fiscal 2012 were comprised of an $81 million charge related to a payment made to the Indian government concurrent with the issuance of the BWA spectrum license, a $54 million impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets of our QMT division and $23 million in goodwill impairment charges related to our QRS division. Other expenses in fiscal 2011 were comprised of a $114 million goodwill impairment charge related to our QRS division.

The decreases in interest expense resulted from capitalizing a portion of interest starting in fiscal 2012 related to the former BWA subsidiaries, which were deconsolidated in fiscal 2013. Net gains on derivative instruments in fiscal 2012 primarily resulted from changes in the fair value of put options sold in connection with our stock repurchase program that expired in fiscal 2012.Income Tax Expense (in millions)Year Ended September 29, 2013 September 30, 2012 September 25, 2011 2013 vs. 2012 Change 2012 vs. 2011 ChangeIncome tax expense$1,349 $1,279 $1,132 $70 $147Effective tax rate16% 19% 20% (3)% (1)%The following table summarizes the primary factors that caused our annual effective tax rates to be less than the United States federal statutory rate: Year Ended September 29, 2013 September 30, 2012 September 25, 2011Expected income tax provision at federal statutory tax rate35% 35% 35%State income tax provision, net of federal benefit—% —% 5%Benefits from foreign income taxed at other than U.S. rates(17%) (16%) (19%)Benefits related to the research and development tax credit(2%) (1%) (3%)Change in valuation allowance—% 1% 1%Other—% —% 1%Effective tax rate16% 19% 20%The effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 reflected a tax benefit of $64 million related to fiscal 2012 resulting from the retroactive extension of the United States research and development tax credit. Additionally, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 reflected increased foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 as compared to fiscal 2011 reflected a reduction in our effective state tax rate as a result of California tax legislation previously enacted, partially offset by increased earnings taxed at the United States tax rate. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 only reflected the United States federal research and development credit generated through December 31, 2011, the date on which the credit expired. 36The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 reflected tax benefits of $44 million related to an agreement reached on a component of our fiscal 2006 through fiscal 2010 state tax returns and $32 million related to fiscal 2010 resulting from the retroactive extension of the United States federal research and development tax credit. Our Segment Results (in millions)The following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011 financial results for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8.

The increases in QCT revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012 of $4.57 billion and $3.28 billion, respectively, were primarily due to increases in equipment and services revenues. Equipment and services revenues, mostly related to sales of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, were $16.49 billion, $11.91 billion and $8.65 billion in fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increases in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012 resulted primarily from increases of $2.09 billion and $651 million, respectively, related to the net effects of changes in product mix and lower average selling prices of such products, increases of $2.05 billion and $1.71 billion, respectively, related to higher unit shipments and increases of $212 million and $803 million, respectively, related to sales of connectivity products. Approximately 716 million, 590 million and 483 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues remained flat in fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2013, QCT revenues increased 38% relative to a combined increase of 26% in research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin percentage. The decrease in QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to a decrease in gross margin percentage, partially offset by an increase of 37% in QCT revenues relative to a combined increase of 33% in research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses. QCT gross margin percentage decreased in fiscal 2013 as a result of the net effects of lower average selling prices and unfavorable product mix, partially offset by a decrease in average unit costs. QCT gross margin percentage decreased in fiscal 2012 as a result of the net effects of lower average selling prices, unfavorable product mix and higher product support costs, partially offset by a decrease in average unit costs. The higher product support costs in fiscal 2012 primarily related to increased expenses incurred to facilitate additional supply of 28 nanometer integrated circuits.QCT inventories increased by 34% in fiscal 2013 from $973 million to $1.30 billion primarily due to certain higher value MSM products and an increase in work-in-process and finished goods related to growth of the business.QTL Segment. The increases in QTL revenues in fiscal 2013 and 2012 of $1.23 billion and $905 million, respectively, were primarily due to increases in sales of CDMA-based devices by licensees. The net increase in QTL revenues in fiscal 2012 also included the effect of $401 million in revenues recorded in fiscal 2011 in connection with settlement agreements entered into with two licensees. The decrease in QTL EBT as a percentage of revenues during fiscal 2013 was attributable to an increase of 19% in revenues relative to an increase of 29% in costs and expenses primarily due to increased allocation of patent expenses in connection with the corporate reorganization and increased research and development expenses. QWI Segment. The decrease in QWI revenues in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to a decrease of $13 million in QIS revenues. The decrease in QWI revenues in fiscal 2012 was primarily due to a $25 million decrease in Omnitracs revenues. QWI costs and expenses in fiscal 2012 and 2011 included $23 million and $114 million respectively, of goodwill impairment charges related to our QRS division. The $16 million decrease in QWI EBT during fiscal 2013, excluding the impairment 37charges, was primarily attributable to a $19 million increase in QRS operating loss (before the impairment charges). The $46 million increase in QWI EBT in fiscal 2012, excluding the impairment charges, was primarily attributable to a $26 million decrease in QRS operating loss (before the impairment charges) and a $25 million decrease in QIS operating loss.QSI Segment. QSI costs and expenses for fiscal 2012 included $81 million related to a payment made to the Indian government concurrent with the issuance of the BWA spectrum license. The increases in QSI EBT in fiscal 2013 and 2012 of $145 million and $43 million, respectively, excluding this expense, were primarily due to increases of $67 million and $40 million, respectively, in net realized gains on investments and decreases of $60 million and $20 million, respectively, in interest expense as a result of capitalizing interest starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2012 related to the BWA subsidiaries, which were deconsolidated in fiscal 2013.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $29.4 billion at September 29, 2013, an increase of $2.6 billion from September 30, 2012. This increase included $1.5 billion in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plans. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 29, 2013 consisted of $8.1 billion held by United States-based subsidiaries and $21.3 billion held by foreign subsidiaries. Of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 29, 2013, $21.2 billion is indefinitely reinvested and would be subject to material tax effects if repatriated. Due to tax considerations, we derive liquidity for operations primarily from domestic cash flow and investments held domestically. Total cash provided by operating activities increased to $8.8 billion during fiscal 2013, compared to $6.0 billion during fiscal 2012.During fiscal 2013, we repurchased and retired 71,696,000 shares of common stock for $4.6 billion, before commissions. At September 29, 2013, approximately $4.9 billion remained available for repurchase under a new stock repurchase program announced in September, and we currently expect to complete a minimum of $4 billion of stock repurchases during fiscal 2014. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. We continue to evaluate repurchases as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to our periodic determinations that repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders.We paid dividends totaling $2.1 billion and $1.6 billion, or $1.20 and $0.93 per common share, during fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively. On March 5, 2013, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.25 to $0.35 per share of common stock. On October 24, 2013, we announced a cash dividend of $0.35 per share of common stock, payable on December 19, 2013 to stockholders of record as of December 2, 2013. We intend to continue to use cash dividends as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.Accounts receivable increased 47% during fiscal 2013. Days sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, were 30 days at September 29, 2013 compared to 29 days at September 30, 2012. The increase in accounts receivable and the related days sales outstanding were primarily due to growth of the business and the effects of timing of shipments and customer payments for receivables related to integrated circuits.We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and our expected cash flow generated from operations will provide us with flexibility and satisfy our working and other capital requirements over the next fiscal year and beyond based on our current business plans.•Our research and development expenditures were $5.0 billion and $3.9 billion in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively, and we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development for new technologies, applications and services for voice and data communications, primarily in the wireless industry.•Cash outflows for capital expenditures were $1.0 billion and $1.3 billion in fiscal 2013 and 2012, respectively, including approximately $480 million in fiscal 2012 related to the construction of a new manufacturing facility in Taiwan for our QMT division. We expect to continue to incur capital expenditures in the future to support our business, including research and development activities. Future capital expenditures may be impacted by transactions that are currently not forecasted.•Our purchase obligations for fiscal 2014, some of which relate to research and development activities and capital expenditures, totaled $3.3 billion at September 29, 2013.•On August 21, 2013, we entered into a definitive agreement under which we agreed to sell the North and Latin American operations of our Omnitracs division for $800 million, subject to closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory approvals. We expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. 38•We expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions, the amounts of which could vary significantly, to open new opportunities for our technologies, obtain development resources, grow our patent portfolio or pursue new business.Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).At September 29, 2013, our outstanding contractual obligations included (in millions):Contractual ObligationsPayments Due By Fiscal Period Total 2014 2015-2016 2017-2018 Beyond2018 NoExpirationDatePurchase obligations (1)$3,558 $3,284 $256 $8 $10 $—Operating lease obligations343 89 135 72 47 —Capital lease obligations (2)36 1 3 3 29 —Equity funding commitments (3)2 — — — — 2Other long-term liabilities (4)(5)42 — 26 8 6 2Total contractual obligations$3,981 $3,374 $420 $91 $92 $4(1)Total purchase obligations include $2.8 billion in commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments for silicon wafers and assembly and test services. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry partners and assembly and test service providers, cancelation of outstanding purchase orders is generally allowed but requires payment of all costs incurred through the date of cancelation. (2)Amounts represent future minimum lease payments including interest payments. Capital lease obligations are included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at September 29, 2013.(3)These commitments do not have fixed funding dates and are subject to certain conditions. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be financed or funded under these arrangements; actual financing or funding may be in lesser amounts or not at all.(4)Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenues, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. Other long-term liabilities as presented in this table include the related current portions.(5)Our consolidated balance sheet at September 29, 2013 included a $208 million noncurrent liability for uncertain tax positions, all of which may result in cash payment. The future payments related to uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities.Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 29, 2013 is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn February 2013, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. This new guidance requires entities to present (either on the face of the statement of operations or in the notes to the financial statements) the effects on the line items in the statement of operations for amounts reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2014. The adoption of the guidance will impact our financial statement presentation and/or our disclosures but will not impact our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskInterest Rate Risk. We invest a portion of our cash in a number of diversified fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, debt funds and derivative instruments, including interest rate swaps, that are subject to interest rate risk. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect the fair value of our investment portfolio. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise, our holdings could lose value. Historically, we presented a table that disclosed certain information (including principal or notional amounts, interest rates and maturities) regarding our interest-bearing instruments. However, given the increased size and diversity in our investment portfolio, we believe that providing a sensitivity analysis provides more meaningful disclosure regarding the impact to our holdings of potential changes in interest rates. As a result, in lieu of the tabular presentation, we are providing a sensitivity analysis that shows the effect of an assumed 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates across the entire yield curve. 39At September 29, 2013, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points on our holdings would have resulted in decreases of $9 million and $443 million in the fair values of our holdings classified as trading (including derivative instruments) and our remaining holdings, respectively. At September 30, 2012, the same hypothetical increase in interest rates would have resulted in decreases of $17 million and $430 million in the fair values of our holdings classified as trading (including derivative instruments) and our remaining holdings, respectively.Equity Price Risk. We hold a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equity securities and fund shares that are subject to equity price risk. We have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size, style, industry and geography, and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and fund shares at September 29, 2013 would cause a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of $332 million. At September 29, 2013, gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and fund shares were $44 million. Although we consider these unrealized losses to be temporary, there is a risk that we may incur other-than-temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these securities if they do not recover in value within a reasonable period.Foreign Exchange Risk. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties. We utilize such derivative financial instruments for hedging or risk management purposes rather than for speculation purposes. Counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major banking institutions. In the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us, which could have a negative impact on our results. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies.At September 29, 2013, we had a net asset of $37 million related to foreign currency option contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on royalties earned from certain licensees on their sales of CDMA-based devices. If our forecasted royalty revenues were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in our hedged foreign currency, we would incur a loss of $1 million. At September 29, 2013, we had a net liability of $8 million related to foreign currency forward contracts that were designated as hedges of foreign currency risk on intercompany payments of operating expenditures relating to a wholly-owned foreign subsidiary. If our forecasted operating expenditures were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in each of our hedged foreign currencies, we would not incur a loss. At September 29, 2013, we had a net liability of $14 million related to foreign currency forwards, futures, options and swaps that were not designated as hedging instruments related to our marketable securities portfolios classified as trading. If the foreign exchange rates relevant to these contracts were to change unfavorably by 10% and we do not have an offset foreign currency exposure relating to debt instruments held in our marketable securities portfolios classified as trading, we would incur a loss of $2 million. Financial assets and liabilities held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global company, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies.Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks.",2023-12-30 18:21:49.518436
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2014,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIn addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report.OverviewFiscal 2014 OverviewThe transition of wireless networks and devices to 3G/4G (CDMA-based, OFDMA-based and CDMA/OFDMA multimode) continued around the world. 3G/4G connections increased to approximately 2.8 billion, up 24% year-over-year, and represent approximately 40% of total cellular connections, up from 34% at the end of fiscal 2013.(1) Revenues were $26.5 billion, an increase of 7% compared to fiscal 2013, with net income attributable to Qualcomm of $8.0 billion, an increase of 16% compared to fiscal 2013.We shipped approximately 861 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) integrated circuits for CDMA- and OFDMA-based wireless devices, an increase of 20%, compared to approximately 716 million MSM integrated circuits in fiscal 2013, largely driven by the adoption of 4G LTE, particularly in China. Growth in fiscal 2014 was largely driven by shipments to key customers for both 3G and 3G/4G multimode mobile devices in emerging regions. In particular, our LTE leadership position contributed to growth from regions adopting 3G/4G LTE multimode. Total reported device sales(2) by licensees were approximately $243.6 billion in fiscal 2014, an increase of approximately 5%, compared to approximately $231.2 billion in fiscal 2013. Our fiscal 2014 results were favorably impacted by increased 3G/4G device shipments by licensees as a result of the continued adoption of smartphones. Our results were negatively impacted by the challenges we are facing in China. Our business practices continue to be the subject of an investigation by the China National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). We also believe that certain licensees in China currently are not fully complying with their contractual obligations to report their sales of licensed products to us (which includes certain licensees underreporting a portion of their 3G/4G device sales and a dispute with a licensee) and that unlicensed companies may seek to delay execution of new licenses while the NDRC investigation is ongoing. We are taking steps to address these matters, although the nature and timing of any resolution is uncertain. During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we announced our intention of returning 75% of our free cash flow (3) to stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends over the foreseeable future, where free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. In fiscal 2014, we returned $7.1 billion, or 93% of free cash flow, to stockholders, including $4.5 billion through repurchases of 60.3 million shares of common stock and $2.6 billion, or $1.54 per share, of cash dividends. Shares outstanding decreased to 1.67 billion at September 28, 2014 from 1.69 billion at September 29, 2013 due to share repurchases, partially offset by net shares issued under our employee benefit plans. (1)According to GSMA Intelligence estimates as of November 3, 2014 for the quarter ended September 30, 2014 (estimates excluded Wireless Local Loop).(2)Total reported device sales is the sum of all reported sales in U.S. dollars (as reported to us by our licensees) of all licensed CDMA-based, OFDMA-based and CDMA/OFDMA multimode subscriber devices (including handsets, modules, modem cards and other subscriber devices) by our licensees during a particular period (collectively, 3G/4G devices). Not all licensees report sales the same way (e.g., some licensees report sales net of permitted deductions, including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items, while other licensees report sales and then identify the amount of permitted deductions in their reports), and the way in which licensees report such information may change from time to time. In addition, certain licensees may not report (in the quarter in which they are contractually obligated to report) their sales of certain types of subscriber units, which (as a result of audits, legal actions or for other reasons) may be reported in a subsequent quarter. Accordingly, total reported device sales for a particular period may include prior period activity that was not reported by the licensee until such particular period.(3)Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information.”Our Business and Operating SegmentsWe design, manufacture, have manufactured on our behalf and market digital communications products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents, software and other rights. We have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through two reportable segments, QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing), and our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. Our reportable segments are operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Following our corporate reorganization at the beginning of fiscal 2013, substantially all of our products 31and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries. QTL continues to be operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which continues to own the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.QCT is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies for use in voice and data communications, networking, application processing, multimedia and global positioning system products. QCT’s integrated circuit products and system software are sold to or licensed to manufacturers that use our products in wireless devices, particularly mobile phones, tablets, laptops, data modules, handheld wireless computers and gaming devices, access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment, and in wired devices, particularly broadband gateway equipment, desktop computers and streaming media players. Our MSM integrated circuits, which include the Mobile Data Modem, Qualcomm Single Chip and Qualcomm Snapdragon processors, perform the core baseband modem functionality in wireless devices providing voice and data communications, as well as multimedia applications and global positioning functions. In addition, our Snapdragon processors provide advanced application and graphics processing capabilities. QCT’s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. QCT revenues comprised 70%, 67% and 63% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.QCT utilizes a fabless production business model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the package assembly and test manufacturing processes. We rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die or wafers from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party suppliers for manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test.QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD (including TD-SCDMA), GSM/GPRS/EDGE and/or OFDMA standards and their derivatives. QTL licensing revenues are comprised of license fees as well as royalties based on sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items). QTL recognizes royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees during the quarter and when other revenue recognition criteria are met. Licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter. QTL revenues comprised 29%, 30% and 33% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues were generated through our licensees’ sales of CDMA2000- and WCDMA-based products, such as feature phones and smartphones.QSI makes strategic investments that are focused on opening new or expanding opportunities for our technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services) for voice and data communications. Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries, including, but not limited to, digital media, e-commerce, energy, healthcare and wearable devices. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity instruments, which generally are recorded using the cost method or the equity method, and convertible debt instruments, which are recorded at fair value. QSI also holds wireless spectrum, which at September 28, 2014, consisted of L-Band spectrum in the United Kingdom. As part of our strategic investment activities, we intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future. During fiscal 2013, we deconsolidated subsidiaries reported in QSI that were established to operate a wireless network in India (the former BWA subsidiaries), and all of our remaining interest was sold in fiscal 2014.During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we reassessed our management reporting as a result of the sale of the North and Latin America operations of our Omnitracs division, among other reasons. The Omnitracs division was previously aggregated with three other divisions into the Qualcomm Wireless & Internet (QWI) reportable segment. Starting in fiscal 2014, the QWI segment was eliminated, and the former QWI divisions are included in nonreportable segments. Nonreportable segments include our QMT (Qualcomm MEMS Technologies), Pixtronix and Small Cells divisions and other wireless technology and service initiatives. QMT plans to license its next generation IMOD (interferometric modulator) display technology and to focus on wearable devices. Pixtronix develops and licenses display technologies based on MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical-systems) structure optimized for portable multimedia devices. Small Cells develops and supplies 323G/LTE and Wi-Fi products designed for implementation of small mobile base stations (known as small cells). Other nonreportable segments develop and offer products and services that include, but are not limited to: software products and content and push-to-talk enablement services to wireless operators; development, other services and related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors; device-to-device communication, including software for the connected home; data center products; medical device connectivity and related data management; and augmented reality.During fiscal 2014, we updated QMT’s business plans and related internal forecasts to reflect decreases in expected cash flows. As a result of these updates, we tested the QMT division’s long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment and recorded total charges of $607 million in other expenses in fiscal 2014.Discontinued OperationsOn November 25, 2013, we completed the sale of the North and Latin America operations of our Omnitracs division to a U.S.-based private equity firm for cash consideration of $788 million (net of cash sold). As a result, we recorded a gain in discontinued operations of $665 million ($430 million net of income tax expense) during fiscal 2014. Total assets and total liabilities were reduced by $150 million and $45 million, respectively. The revenues and operating results of the North and Latin America operations of the Omnitracs division, which comprised substantially all of the Omnitracs division, were not presented as discontinued operations in any fiscal period because they were immaterial. The related assets (included in other current assets and other noncurrent assets) and liabilities (included in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities) of $139 million and $43 million, respectively, were classified as held for sale at September 29, 2013.On March 27, 2011, the FLO TV business and network were shut down. On December 27, 2011, we completed the sale of substantially all of our 700 MHz spectrum for $1.9 billion, and as a result, we recognized a gain in discontinued operations of $1.2 billion during fiscal 2012. Accordingly, the results of operations of the FLO TV business were presented as discontinued operations. Income (loss) from discontinued operations included share-based compensation and excluded certain general corporate expenses allocated to the FLO TV business during the periods presented. Discontinued operations in fiscal 2012 were $1.2 billion ($776 million net of income tax expense). Looking ForwardWe expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G products and services around the world, driven primarily by smartphones. We also expect growth in new device categories and industries, driven by the expanding adoption of certain technologies that are already commonly used in smartphones. As we look forward to the next several months, we expect our business to be impacted by the following key items:•Further expansion of 3G and 3G/4G multimode in emerging regions, particularly in China. We expect that the increased availability of low-tier 3G/4G smartphone products will help enable such expansion.•We expect that 3G/4G device prices will continue to vary broadly due to the increased penetration of smartphones combined with competition throughout the world at all price tiers. Additionally, varying rates of economic growth by region, and stronger growth of device shipments in emerging regions as compared to developed regions, are expected to continue to impact the average and range of selling prices of 3G/4G devices.•China continues to present significant opportunities for us, particularly with the rollout of 3G/4G LTE multimode. We expect the rollout of 4G services in China will encourage competition and growth, bring the benefits of 3G/4G LTE multimode to consumers, encourage consumers to replace 2G (GSM) and 3G devices and enable new opportunities (e.g., machine-to-machine) for the industry.•China also presents significant challenges, as our business practices continue to be the subject of an investigation by the China National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). We also believe that certain licensees in China currently are not fully complying with their contractual obligations to report their sales of licensed products to us (which includes certain licensees underreporting a portion of their 3G/4G device sales and a dispute with a licensee) and that unlicensed companies may seek to delay execution of new licenses while the NDRC investigation is ongoing. Litigation and/or other actions may be necessary to compel these licensees to report such sales and pay the required royalties for such sales and unlicensed companies to execute new licenses. Further, our success in China is in part dependent upon the rate of commercialization of 4G LTE products in China.•We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements in 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G LTE (an OFDMA-based standard) technologies, audio and video codecs, wireless baseband chips, our converged computing/communications (Snapdragon) chips, graphics, connectivity, multimedia products, software and services. We are also investing across a broad spectrum of opportunities that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and enter into new industry segments, such as products designed for implementation of small cells and addressing the challenge of meeting the increased demand for data; products for the connected home and the 33Internet of Everything; automotive; very high speed connectivity; new display technologies; data centers; mobile health; wireless charging; and machine learning, including robotics.•In October 2014, we announced that we had reached agreement with CSR plc on the terms of a recommended cash offer to acquire the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of CSR for £9.00 per ordinary share, which values the entire issued and to be issued share capital of CSR at approximately £1.6 billion (approximately $2.5 billion based upon an exchange rate of USD: GBP 1.6057). CSR is an innovator in the development of multifunction semiconductor platforms and technologies for the auto, consumer and voice and music market segments. The acquisition complements our current offerings by adding products, channels and customers in the growth categories of the Internet of Everything and automotive infotainment, accelerating our presence and path to leadership. The acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including receipt of United States and other regulatory approvals and the approval of CSR’s shareholders. Subject to the satisfaction of these conditions, the acquisition is expected to close by the end of the summer of 2015. In addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants and governments in the wireless value chain as to the benefits of our business model and our extensive technology investments in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry. However, we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. We expect that such companies and/or governments or regulators will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world.Further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the Risk Factors included in this Annual Report.Critical Accounting EstimatesOur discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to valuation of goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and long-lived assets, valuation of marketable securities, income taxes and litigation. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. These estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Although we believe that our estimates and the assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, actual results that differ from our estimates could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results and financial position. We believe that the following significant accounting estimates may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others.Valuation of Goodwill, Other Indefinite-Lived Assets and Long-Lived Assets. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. We also acquire intangible assets in other types of transactions. At September 28, 2014, our goodwill, other intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, and property, plant and equipment, net of depreciation, were $4.5 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively. The determination of the value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. The estimated fair values of such intangible assets are used to establish their recorded values. For intangible assets acquired in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred (or the estimated fair values of the assets received, if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values, unless the values of neither the assets received nor the assets transferred are determinable within reasonable limits, in which case the assets received are measured based on the carrying values of the assets transferred. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. An estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions that require significant judgment. For example, the income approach generally requires assumptions related to the appropriate business model to be used to estimate cash flows, total addressable market, pricing and share forecasts, competition, technology obsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of certain assets may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models. New information may arise in the future that affects our fair value estimates and could result in adjustments to our estimates in the future, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in 34circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets may be based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions, expected selling price and/or other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows, volumes, market penetration and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning, when appropriate. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on a portion or all of our goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. During fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded $607 million, $158 million and $54 million, respectively, in impairment charges for goodwill and long-lived assets resulting from updates to our estimates of the expected cash flows of our QMT division as we transition to a licensing model. Goodwill of nonreportable segments that was at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test was not material at September 28, 2014.Valuation of Marketable Securities. We hold investments in marketable securities, including U.S. Treasury and government-related securities, corporate bonds and notes, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, auction rate securities, common and preferred stock and equity and debt funds. The fair value of these investments totaled $24.1 billion at September 28, 2014, with increases and decreases in fair value generally recorded through stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income or loss. We record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring impairment charges. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; how long the market value of the security has been less than its cost basis; the security’s relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; expected market volatility; the market and economy in general; analyst recommendations and price targets; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates, as applicable. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, we record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recorded $156 million, $72 million and $71 million, respectively, in impairment losses on our investments in marketable securities.Income Taxes. Our income tax returns are based on calculations and assumptions that are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by taxing authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known. We are participating in the IRS Compliance Assurance Process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the IRS on the treatment of all issues prior to filing our federal return. A benefit of participation in this program is that post-filing adjustments by the IRS are less likely to occur.Our QCT segment’s non-United States headquarters is located in Singapore. We obtained tax incentives in Singapore that commenced in March 2012, including a tax exemption for the first five years, provided that we meet specified employment and incentive criteria, and as a result of expiration of these incentives, our Singapore tax rate will increase in fiscal 2017 and again in fiscal 2027.We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States based on our plans for use and/or investment outside of the United States and our belief that our sources of cash and liquidity in the United States will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. On a regular basis, we consider projected cash needs for, among other things, investments in our existing businesses, future research and development, potential acquisitions and capital transactions, including repurchases of our common stock and debt repayments. We estimate the amount of cash or other liquidity that is available or needed in the jurisdictions where these investments are expected, as well as our ability to generate cash in those jurisdictions and our access to capital markets. This analysis enables us to conclude whether or not we will indefinitely reinvest the current period’s foreign earnings. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $9.1 billion related to the United States federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on 35approximately $25.7 billion of undistributed earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Should we decide to no longer indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the United States, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we make such determination.Legal Proceedings. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves. However, the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. A broad range of remedies with respect to our business practices that are deemed to violate applicable laws are potentially available. These remedies may include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or to modify our business practices. We record our best estimate of a loss related to pending legal proceedings when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Where a range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability related to pending legal proceedings and revise our estimates. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations. Regarding the NDRC matter, we believe that a loss is probable but that any possible range of loss cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.Results of OperationsRevenues (in millions)Year Ended September 28, 2014 September 29, 2013 September 30, 2012 2014 vs. 2013 Change 2013 vs. 2012 ChangeEquipment and services$18,625 $16,988 $12,465 $1,637 $4,523Licensing7,862 7,878 6,656 (16) 1,222 $26,487 $24,866 $19,121 $1,621 $5,745The increases in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2013 were primarily due to increases in QCT revenues of $1.94 billion and $4.58 billion, respectively. The increase in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2014 was partially offset by a decrease of $305 million as a result of the sale of our Omnitracs division during fiscal 2014. The decrease in our licensing revenues in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in a nonreportable segment’s revenues of $32 million, partially offset by an increase in QTL revenues of $15 million. The increase in our licensing revenues in fiscal 2013 was primarily due to an increase in QTL revenues of $1.23 billion.QCT and QTL segment revenues related to the products of Samsung Electronics and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd/Foxconn, its affiliates and other suppliers to Apple Inc. comprised 49%, 43% and 38% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.Revenues from customers in China, South Korea and Taiwan comprised 50%, 23% and 11%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2014, compared to 49%, 20%, and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2013, and 42%, 22% and 14%, respectively, for fiscal 2012. We report revenues from external customers by country based on the location to which our products or services are delivered, which for QCT is generally the country in which our customers manufacture their products, or for licensing revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees. As a result, the revenues by country presented herein are not necessarily indicative of either the country in which the devices containing our products and/or intellectual property are ultimately sold to consumers or the country in which the companies that sell the devices are headquartered. For example, China revenues would include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.Costs and Expenses (in millions)Year Ended September 28, 2014 September 29, 2013 September 30, 2012 2014 vs. 2013 Change 2013 vs. 2012 ChangeCost of equipment and services (E&S) revenues$10,686 $9,820 $7,096 $866 $2,724Cost as % of E&S revenues57% 58% 57% 36The increase in margin percentage in fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to a net decrease in gross margin losses incurred by our nonreportable segments, partially offset by a decrease in QCT’s gross margin. The decrease in margin percentage in fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to a decrease in QCT gross margin percentage. Our margin percentage may continue to fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of products sold and services provided, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors.

Remaining dollar increases were related to research and development of other new product and licensing initiatives. The dollar decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to decreases of $59 million in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, $53 million in share-based compensation, $53 million in selling and marketing expenses and $22 million in employee-related expenses. The decrease in employee-related expenses and a portion of the decrease in share-based compensation in fiscal 2014 were due to the sale of our Omnitracs division during fiscal 2014. The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2013 was primarily attributable to a $113 million increase in employee-related expenses, a $56 million increase in selling and marketing expenses, a $40 million increase in patent-related expenses and a $29 million increase in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by a decrease of $23 million in share-based compensation.Other expenses in fiscal 2014 were comprised of $607 million in long-lived asset and goodwill impairment charges and $19 million in restructuring-related costs incurred by our QMT division, a $16 million goodwill impairment charge related to our former QRS (Qualcomm Retail Solutions) division and a $15 million legal settlement, partially offset by the reversal of a $173 million expense accrual recorded in fiscal 2013 related to the ParkerVision verdict against us. Other expenses in fiscal 2013 were comprised of the $173 million ParkerVision charge and a $158 million impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets of our QMT division. Other expenses in fiscal 2012 were comprised of an $81 million charge related to the former BWA subsidiaries, a $54 million impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets of our QMT division and $23 million in goodwill impairment charges related to our former QRS division.

The increase in impairment losses on marketable securities and other investments in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase in our recognition of unrealized losses on marketable debt securities that we intended to sell or that we more likely than not would sell 37before recovery, which was also impacted by our portfolio rebalancing. We have completed the majority of our rebalancing, and as a result, we expect to earn lower interest and dividend income and record lower realized gains in fiscal 2015, compared to fiscal 2014.The increase in interest and dividend income in fiscal 2013 resulted from higher average balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities in fiscal 2013, compared to fiscal 2012. The decrease in interest expense in fiscal 2013 resulted from capitalizing a portion of interest starting in fiscal 2012 related to the former BWA subsidiaries, which were deconsolidated in fiscal 2013. Net gains on derivative instruments in fiscal 2012 primarily resulted from changes in the fair value of put options sold in connection with our stock repurchase program that expired in fiscal 2012.Income Tax Expense (in millions)Year Ended September 28, 2014 September 29, 2013 September 30, 2012 2014 vs. 2013 Change 2013 vs. 2012 ChangeIncome tax expense$1,244 $1,349 $1,279 $(105) $70Effective tax rate14% 16% 19% (2)% (3%)The following table summarizes the primary factors that caused our annual effective tax rates to be less than the United States federal statutory rate: Year Ended September 28, 2014 September 29, 2013 September 30, 2012Expected income tax provision at federal statutory tax rate35% 35% 35%Benefits from foreign income taxed at other than U.S. rates(20%) (17%) (16%)Benefits related to the research and development tax credits(1%) (2%) (1%)Change in valuation allowance—% —% 1%Effective tax rate14% 16% 19%The effective tax rate for our state income tax provision, net of federal benefit, was negligible for all years presented. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 reflected a tax benefit of $66 million related to fiscal 2013 resulting from an agreement reached with the Internal Revenue Service on components of our fiscal 2013 tax return. Additionally, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 reflected increased foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 reflected a tax benefit of $64 million related to fiscal 2012 resulting from the retroactive extension of the United States research and development tax credit. Additionally, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 as compared to fiscal 2012 reflected increased foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 reflected a reduction in our effective state tax rate as a result of California tax legislation previously enacted, partially offset by increased earnings taxed at the United States tax rate. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 only reflected the United States federal research and development credit generated through December 31, 2011, the date on which the credit expired.Our Segment Results (in millions)The following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012 financial results for each reporting segment. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.” 38 QCT QTL QSI2014 Revenues$18,665 $7,569 $—EBT (1)3,807 6,590 (7)EBT as a % of revenues20% 87% 2013 Revenues$16,715 $7,554 $—EBT (1)3,189 6,590 56EBT as a % of revenues19% 87% 2012 Revenues$12,141 $6,327 $—EBT (1)2,296 5,585 (170)EBT as a % of revenues19% 88% (1)Earnings (loss) before taxes.QCT Segment. The increases in QCT revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2013 of $1.95 billion and $4.57 billion, respectively, were primarily due to increases in equipment and services revenues. Equipment and services revenues, mostly related to sales of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, were $18.43 billion, $16.49 billion and $11.91 billion in fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase in equipment and services revenues in 2014 resulted primarily from increases of $2.66 billion related to higher MSM and accompanying RF and PM unit shipments and $203 million related to sales of connectivity products, partially offset by a net decrease of $1.08 billion resulting from lower average selling prices offset by higher-priced product mix. The increase in equipment and services revenues in 2013 resulted primarily from a net increase of $2.09 billion resulting from higher-priced product mix offset by lower average selling prices and increases of $2.05 billion related to higher MSM and accompanying RF and PM unit shipments and $212 million related to sales of connectivity products. Approximately 861 million, 716 million and 590 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2014, compared to fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2014, QCT revenues increased 12% relative to a combined increase of 5% in research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, whereas gross margin percentage decreased as a result of lower average selling prices and lower-margin product mix, partially offset by lower average unit costs. QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues remained flat in fiscal 2013, compared to fiscal 2012. During fiscal 2013, QCT revenues increased 38% relative to a combined increase of 26% in research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, whereas QCT gross margin percentage decreased as a result of lower average selling prices and lower-margin product mix, partially offset by lower average unit costs.QCT inventories increased by 12% in fiscal 2014 from $1.30 billion to $1.46 billion primarily due to an increase in work-in-process and finished goods related to the growth of the business.QTL Segment. The increases in QTL revenues in fiscal 2014 and 2013 of $15 million and $1.23 billion, respectively, were primarily due to increases in sales of CDMA-based products, including multimode products that also implement OFDMA, by licensees, partially offset by decreases in revenues per unit. QTL EBT as a percentage of revenues remained flat in fiscal 2014, compared to fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2014, QTL revenues increased slightly relative to an increase of 2% in costs and expenses. QTL revenues and EBT for fiscal 2014 were impacted by units that we believe are being underreported by certain licensees, a dispute with a licensee and sales of certain unlicensed products in China. The decrease in QTL EBT as a percentage of revenues during fiscal 2013 was attributable to an increase of 19% in revenues relative to an increase of 29% in costs and expenses primarily due to increased allocation of patent expenses in connection with the corporate reorganization and increased research and development expenses. QSI Segment. The decrease in QSI EBT in fiscal 2014 of $63 million was primarily due to a decrease of $39 million in net realized gains on investments and an increase of $35 million in impairment losses on investments, partially offset by a decrease of $16 million in interest expense related to the former BWA subsidiaries. QSI costs and expenses for fiscal 2012 included $81 million related to the former BWA subsidiaries; the increase in QSI EBT in fiscal 2013 of $145 million, excluding the impact of this fiscal 2012 expense, was primarily due to an increase of $67 million in net realized gains on investments and a decrease of $60 million in interest expense incurred by the former BWA subsidiaries. 39Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $32.0 billion at September 28, 2014, an increase of $2.6 billion from September 29, 2013. This increase included $1.4 billion in proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our equity compensation plans and $788 million in net proceeds from the sale of the North and Latin America operations of our Omnitracs division. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 28, 2014 consisted of $5.8 billion held by United States-based entities and $26.2 billion held by foreign entities. Most of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign entities is indefinitely reinvested and would be subject to material tax effects if repatriated. However, we believe that our United States sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the United States and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds. Total cash provided by operating activities increased to $8.9 billion during fiscal 2014, compared to $8.8 billion during fiscal 2013.Accounts receivable increased 13% during fiscal 2014. Days sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, were 32 days at September 28, 2014, compared to 30 days at September 29, 2013. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the effects of increased revenues related to integrated circuits and a receivable related to a dispute with a licensee. The increase in days sales outstanding was primarily due to a receivable related to a dispute with a licensee.During fiscal 2014, we repurchased and retired 60,253,000 shares of common stock for $4.5 billion, before commissions. On March 4, 2014, we announced that we had been authorized to repurchase up to $7.8 billion of our common stock. At September 28, 2014, approximately $5.3 billion remained available for repurchase under our stock repurchase program. Since September 28, 2014, we repurchased and retired 8,595,000 shares of common stock for $638 million. We continue to evaluate repurchases as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to our periodic determinations that repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders.We paid cash dividends totaling $2.6 billion and $2.1 billion, or $1.54 and $1.20 per common share, during fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. On March 4, 2014, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend from $0.35 to $0.42 per share of common stock. On October 16, 2014, we announced a cash dividend of $0.42 per share on our common stock, payable on December 18, 2014 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2014. We intend to continue to use cash dividends as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.We intend to return 75% of our free cash flow to stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends over the foreseeable future, where free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. To meet this goal, we expect to use existing cash and marketable securities held by, and cash flow generated from, United States-based entities, and we anticipate that we will supplement this by borrowing additional funds in fiscal 2015. The requirement for and timing of such borrowing is subject to a number of factors, including the cash flow generated by United States-based entities, acquisitions and strategic investments, acceptable interest rates and changes in corporate income tax law, among other factors. Subject to the foregoing paragraph, we believe our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and our expected cash flow generated from operations will satisfy our working and other capital requirements over the next fiscal year and beyond based on our current business plans. Recent and expected working and other capital requirements also include:•Our research and development expenditures were $5.5 billion and $5.0 billion in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively, and we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development for new technologies, applications and services for voice and data communications, primarily in the wireless industry.•Cash outflows for capital expenditures were $1.2 billion and $1.0 billion in fiscal 2014 and 2013, respectively. We expect to continue to incur capital expenditures in the future to support our business, including research and development activities. Future capital expenditures may be impacted by transactions that are currently not forecasted.•Our purchase obligations for fiscal 2015, some of which relate to research and development activities and capital expenditures, totaled $3.4 billion at September 28, 2014.•In October 2014, we announced that we had reached agreement with CSR plc on the terms of a recommended cash offer to acquire the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of CSR for £9.00 per ordinary share, which values the entire issued and to be issued share capital of CSR at approximately £1.6 billion (approximately $2.5 billion based upon an exchange rate of USD: GBP 1.6057). We expect to use existing cash resources to fund the acquisition. The acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including receipt of United States and other regulatory approvals and the approval of CSR’s shareholders. Subject to the satisfaction of these conditions, the acquisition is expected to close by the end of the summer of 2015. 40•We expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions, the amounts of which could vary significantly, to open new opportunities for our technologies, obtain development resources, grow our patent portfolio and/or pursue new businesses.Contractual Obligations / Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal period for our outstanding contractual obligations at September 28, 2014 (in millions): Total 2015 2016-2017 2018-2019 Beyond2019 NoExpirationDatePurchase obligations (1)$3,607 $3,421 $121 $36 $29 $—Operating lease obligations304 91 137 51 25 —Equity funding and financing commitments (2)78 22 52 — — 4Other long-term liabilities (3)(4)53 1 23 14 8 7Total contractual obligations$4,042 $3,535 $333 $101 $62 $11(1)Total purchase obligations include $2.8 billion in commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments for wafers, die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancelation of outstanding purchase orders is generally allowed but requires payment of all costs incurred through the date of cancelation. (2)Certain of these commitments do not have fixed funding dates and are subject to certain conditions. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be funded under these arrangements; actual funding may be in lesser amounts or not at all.(3)Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenues, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. Other long-term liabilities as presented in this table include the related current portions.(4)Our consolidated balance sheet at September 28, 2014 included $76 million in noncurrent liabilities for uncertain tax positions, some of which may result in cash payment. The future payments related to uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities.Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 28, 2014 is provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which outlines a comprehensive revenue recognition model and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. The new standard requires a company to recognize revenue upon transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the expected consideration to be received in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step approach for recognizing revenue which may require a company to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. This ASU will be effective for us starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The new standard allows for two methods of adoption: (a) full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented, or (b) modified retrospective adoption, meaning the cumulative effect of applying the new standard is recognized as an adjustment to the fiscal 2018 opening retained earnings balance. We are in the process of determining the adoption method as well as the effects the adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements.Non-GAAP Financial InformationThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to free cash flow and return of capital to stockholders as a percent of free cash flow. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and “return of capital to stockholders” as cash paid to repurchase shares of our common stock and cash dividends paid.The non-GAAP financial information presented should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, “non-GAAP” is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our measure of non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. 41We use free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow our business and to create long-term stockholder value. We believe return of capital to stockholders as a percentage of free cash flow provides insight into our cash-generating activities relative to the amount of capital returned to stockholders. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. The following is a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results for fiscal 2014 (dollars in millions): Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP)$8,887Capital expenditures(1,185)Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$7,702 Cash paid to repurchase shares of our common stock (before commissions)$4,548Cash dividends paid2,586Total return of capital to stockholders$7,134 Total return of capital to stockholders as a percentage of net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP)80%Total return of capital to stockholders as a percentage of free cash flow (non-GAAP)93%Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskInterest Rate Risk. We invest a portion of our cash in a number of diversified fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, debt funds and derivative instruments (including interest rate swaps) that are subject to interest rate risk. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect the fair value of our investment portfolio. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise, our holdings could lose value. We provide a sensitivity analysis that shows the effect of an assumed 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates across the entire yield curve. At September 28, 2014, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points on our holdings would have resulted in decreases of $12 million and $360 million in the fair values of our holdings classified as trading (including derivative instruments) and our remaining holdings, respectively. Equity Price Risk. We hold a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equity securities and fund shares that are subject to equity price risk. We have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size, style, industry and geography, and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and fund shares at September 28, 2014 would have caused a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of $234 million. At September 28, 2014, gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and fund shares were negligible. Although we consider the unrealized losses to be temporary, there is a risk that we may incur other-than-temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these securities if they do not recover in value within a reasonable period.Foreign Exchange Risk. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties. We utilize such derivative financial instruments for hedging or risk management purposes rather than for speculation purposes. Counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major banking institutions. In the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us, which could have a negative impact on our results. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies” for a description of our foreign currency accounting policies.At September 28, 2014, our net asset related to foreign currency option contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency risk (on royalties earned from certain licensees on their sales of CDMA-based devices) were negligible. If our forecasted royalty revenues for currencies in which we hedge were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in our hedged foreign currency, we would not incur a loss as our hedge positions would continue to be fully effective. At September 28, 2014, our net asset related to foreign currency forwards, futures, options and swaps in our marketable securities portfolios that were not designated as hedging instruments were negligible. If the foreign exchange rates relevant to these contracts were to change unfavorably by 10% and we do not have an offset foreign currency exposure relating to debt instruments held in our marketable securities portfolios classified as trading, we would incur a negligible loss. Financial assets and liabilities held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global company, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain 42assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies.Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks.",2023-12-30 18:21:47.463497
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2015,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Our Business and Operating Segments” under the heading “Seasonality.”Strategic Realignment PlanIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we announced a Strategic Realignment Plan designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth as we work to create sustainable long-term value for stockholders. The core elements of this plan include (a) right-sizing our cost structure; (b) reviewing alternatives to our corporate and financial structure; (c) reaffirming our plan to return significant capital to stockholders; (d) adding new Directors with complementary skills while reducing the average tenure of our Board of Directors; (e) further aligning executive compensation with performance and stockholder return objectives; and (f) making disciplined investments in areas that build upon our core technologies and capabilities and offer attractive growth opportunities and returns. As part of this, among other actions, we are implementing a cost reduction plan to reduce annual costs from fiscal 2015 levels (adjusted for variable compensation) of $7.3 billion (as announced on July 22, 2015) by approximately $1.1 billion through a series of targeted reductions across our businesses, particularly in QCT. We also plan to reduce annual share-based compensation grants by approximately $300 million. We expect these cost reduction initiatives to be fully implemented by the end of fiscal 2016. Additional information regarding our Strategic Realignment Plan is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10. Strategic Realignment Plan.”Corporate StructureWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operations and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by QUALCOMM Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM 12Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.Revenue Concentrations, Significant Customers and Geographical InformationConsolidated revenues from international customers and licensees as a percentage of total revenues were 99%, 99% and 97% in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During fiscal 2015, 53%, 16% and 13% of our revenues were from customers and licensees based in China (including Hong Kong), South Korea and Taiwan, respectively, compared to 50%, 23% and 11% during fiscal 2014, respectively, and 49%, 20% and 11% during fiscal 2013, respectively. We report revenues from external customers by country based on the location to which our products or services are delivered, which for QCT is generally the country in which our customers manufacture their products, or for licensing revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees. As a result, the revenues by country presented herein are not necessarily indicative of either the country in which the devices containing our products and/or intellectual property are ultimately sold to consumers or the country in which the companies that sell the devices are headquartered. For example, China revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States. Additional geographic information is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.”A small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, revenues from Samsung Electronics and from Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd./Foxconn, its affiliates and other suppliers to Apple Inc. each comprised more than 10% of consolidated revenues.Research and DevelopmentThe communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in CDMA, OFDMA and a broad range of other technologies. Using these engineering resources, we expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products and services, including continuing the development of CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies, developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world. Our research and development team has a demonstrated track record of innovation in voice and data communication technologies and application processor technology, among others. Our research and development expenditures in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 totaled approximately $5.5 billion, $5.5 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively.We develop, commercialize and actively support 3G CDMA-based technologies, including CDMA2000 1X, 1xEV-DO, EV-DO Revision A, EV-DO Revision B, 1X Advanced, WCDMA, HSDPA, HSUPA, HSPA+ and TD-SCDMA, as well as OFDMA-based technologies (including LTE), products and network operations, to grow our licensing and integrated circuit and related software revenues. We also make acquisitions to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or to pursue new business opportunities.We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops), consumer electronics and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G and 4G LTE technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including WLAN, Bluetooth, Ethernet, GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other mobile client software environments in our chipsets.We develop on our own, and with our partners, innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition.We have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world that support our global development activities and ongoing efforts to advance CDMA, OFDMA and a broad range of other technologies. We continue to use our substantial engineering resources and expertise to develop new technologies, applications and services 13and make them available to licensees to help grow the communications industry and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities.We make investments across a broad spectrum of opportunities that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and enter into new industry segments, such as technologies to address: the connected home and the Internet of Things; automotive; networking; mobile computing; small cells, which can be used by carriers to extend the capacity of licensed and unlicensed wireless spectrum, and the challenge of meeting the increased demand for data; very high speed connectivity; data centers; mobile health; wireless charging; and machine learning, including robotics.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing activities of our operating segments are discussed under Operating Segments. Other marketing activities include public relations, advertising, digital marketing and social media, participation in technical conferences and trade shows, development of business cases and white papers, competitive analyses, industry intelligence and other marketing programs, such as marketing development funds with our customers. Our Corporate Marketing department provides company information on our Internet site and through other channels regarding our products, strategies and technology to industry analysts and media.CompetitionCompetition faced by our operating segments is discussed under Operating Segments. Competition in the communications industry throughout the world continues to increase at a rapid pace as consumers, businesses and governments realize the potential of wireless communications products and services. We have facilitated competition in the wireless communications industry by licensing our technologies to, and therefore enabling, a large number of manufacturers. Although we have attained a significant position in the industry, many of our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: lower cost structures; motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products or to find alternate suppliers or choose alternate technologies; foreign government support of other technologies or our competitors; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and original equipment manufacturers in emerging geographic regions (such as China); and/or a more established presence in certain regions. These relationships may affect customers’ decisions to purchase products or license technology from us. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market positions to our detriment.We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings and introduce new technologies and services in the future and as additional companies compete with our products or services based on 3G, 4G or other technologies. Although we intend to continue to make substantial investments in developing new products and technologies and improving existing products and technologies, our competitors may introduce alternative products, services or technologies that threaten our business. It is also possible that the prices we charge for our products and services may continue to decline as competition continues to intensify.Corporate Responsibility and SustainabilityWe strive to better our local and global communities through ethical business practices, socially empowering technology applications, educational and environmental programs and employee diversity and volunteerism.•Our Governance.

Risk FactorsYou should consider each of the following factors as well as the other information in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report, including our financial statements and the related notes.Risks Related to Our BusinessesOur revenues depend on commercial network deployments, expansions and upgrades of CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on these technologies and our ability to drive our customers’ demand for our products and services.We develop, patent and commercialize technology and products based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, which are primarily wireless. We depend on our customers, our licensees and operators of wireless networks to 16use these technologies in their adoption of our products and services into their devices and networks and on the timing of their deployments of new products and services. We also depend on our customers and licensees to develop products and services with value-added features to drive consumer demand for new 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G devices, as well as the selling prices for such devices. Further, our rate of revenue growth depends on third parties incorporating our technology, products and/or services into new device types used in industries beyond traditional cellular communications, such as automotive, connected home and wearable uses. Our revenues and/or growth in revenues could be negatively impacted, our business may be harmed and our substantial investments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return, if:•wireless operators and industries beyond traditional cellular communications deploy alternative technologies;•wireless operators delay 3G and 3G/4G multimode network deployments, expansions or upgrades and/or delay moving 2G customers to 3G, 3G/4G multimode or 4G wireless devices;•LTE, an OFDMA-based 4G wireless technology, is not more widely deployed or further commercial deployment is delayed;•government regulators delay making sufficient spectrum available for 3G and/or 3G/4G networks, thereby restricting the expansion of 3G/4G wireless connectivity to keep pace with consumer demand;•wireless operators are unable to drive improvements in 3G or 3G/4G multimode network performance and/or capacity;•our customers’ and licensees’ revenues and sales of products, particularly premium-tier products, and services using these technologies do not grow or do not grow as quickly as anticipated due to, for example, the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed regions (where premium-tier products are common) or a reduction in the rate of device replacements by consumers; and/or•we are unable to drive the adoption of our products and services into networks and devices based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies.Our industry is subject to competition in an environment of rapid technological change that could result in decreased demand and/or declining average selling prices for our products and those of our customers and/or licensees and/or result in placing new specifications or requirements on our products, each of which could negatively affect our revenues and operating results.Our products, services and technologies face significant competition, and the revenues we generate and/or the timing of such revenues, which depend on deployments and/or actions by others, may not meet expectations. We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to attract new business and/or customers, and as new opportunities develop, any of which would put continued pressure on the pricing of our products and services. Competition in wireless communications is affected by various factors that include, among others: device manufacturer concentrations; growth in emerging geographic regions; government intervention; evolving industry standards and business models; evolving methods of transmission of voice and data communications; increasing data traffic and densification of wireless networks; convergence and aggregation of connectivity technologies (including Wi-Fi and LTE) in both devices and access points; consolidation of wireless technologies and infrastructure at the network edge; networking and connectivity trends (including cloud services); the evolving nature of computing (including demand for always on, always connected capabilities); the speed of technological change (including the transition to smaller geometry process technologies); value-added features that drive selling prices as well as consumer demand for new 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G devices; turnkey, integrated products that incorporate hardware, software, user interface, applications and reference designs; rapid growth in mobile data consumption; scalability; and the ability of the system technology to meet customers’ immediate and future network requirements. We anticipate that additional competitors will introduce products as a result of growth opportunities in wireless communications, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, technological and public policy changes and relatively low barriers to entry in certain segments of the industry. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape. We expect that our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:•differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features (e.g., modem, radio frequency front end, central, graphics and/or other processors, camera and connectivity) and with smaller geometry process technologies that drive performance;•develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points to effectively cover both emerging and developed geographic regions and all device tiers; 17•continue to drive the adoption of our integrated circuit products into the most popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices, such as smartphones, tablets, automobiles, wearable and other connected devices and infrastructure products;•maintain and/or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit products at the premium device tier, while increasing the adoption of our products in mid- and low-tier devices and in the turnkey product channel, in part by strengthening our integrated circuit product roadmap for, and developing channel relationships in, emerging geographic regions, such as China and India, and by providing turnkey products, which incorporate our integrated circuits, for low- and mid-tier smartphones and tablets;•continue to be a leader in 4G technology evolution, including expansion of our LTE-based single mode licensing program, and continue to innovate and introduce 4G turnkey, integrated products and services that differentiate us from our competition;•be a leader serving original equipment manufacturers, high level operating systems (HLOS) providers, operators and other industry participants as competitors, new industry entrants and other factors continue to affect the industry landscape;•be a preferred partner (and sustain preferred relationships) providing integrated circuit products that support multiple operating system and infrastructure platforms to industry participants that effectively commercialize new devices using these platforms;•increase and/or accelerate demand for our wired and wireless connectivity products, including networking products for consumers, carriers and enterprise equipment and connected devices;•identify potential acquisition targets that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic needs, reach agreement on terms acceptable to us and effectively integrate these new businesses and/or technologies;•create stand-alone value and/or contribute to the success of our existing businesses through acquisitions and other investments (and/or by developing customer, licensee and/or vendor relationships) in new industry segments and/or disruptive technologies, products and/or services (such as products for the connected home and the Internet of Things, automotive, networking, mobile computing, mobile health, machine learning, including robotics, and wireless charging, among others); •become a leading supplier of radio frequency front end products, which are designed to address cellular radio frequency band fragmentation while improving radio frequency performance and assist original equipment manufacturers in developing multiband, multimode mobile devices; and/or •continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in mobile computing and other consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging geographic regions.Competition in any or all product tiers, customer concentration and/or growth in sales of mid- and low-tier products, particularly relative to premium-tier products, may reduce average selling prices for our chipset products and the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging geographic regions (e.g., China). Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees’ products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.Companies that promote standards that are neither CDMA- nor OFDMA-based (e.g., GSM, Wi-Fi) as well as companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Airoha Technology Corp., Broadcom, Ericsson, HiSilicon Technologies, Intel, Marvell Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, MediaTek, Microchip Technology Inc., Nvidia, Realtek Semiconductor, Samsung Electronics and Spreadtrum Communications (which is controlled by Tsinghua Unigroup). Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: lower cost structures; motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products or to find alternate suppliers or choose alternative technologies; foreign government support of other technologies or competitors; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and original equipment manufacturers in emerging geographic regions (such as China); and/or a more established presence in certain regions.Certain of our software and our suppliers’ software may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, and we have seen, and believe we will continue to see, an increase in customers requesting that we develop products, including 18software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers, or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage. Also, our use and our customers’ use of open source software may subject our products and our customers’ products to governmental scrutiny and delays in product certification, which could cause customers to view our products as less desirable than our competitors’ products. While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property rights, our use of open source software presents risks that could have an adverse effect on these rights and on our business.We derive a significant portion of our consolidated revenues from a small number of customers and licensees. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our operating results could be negatively affected.Our QCT segment derives a significant portion of revenues from a small number of customers, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience an increasing concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. In addition, certain of our largest integrated circuit customers develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past chosen, and may in the future, choose to utilize in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products (and/or sell their integrated circuit products to third parties in competition with us). The loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by such customers (due to their vertical integration strategies referenced above or otherwise) or cancelation of significant purchases from any of these customers would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected operating results, and a delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Further, concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers’ new or next generation product introductions, over which we have little or no control, and the timing of such introductions may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Accordingly, if current industry dynamics and concentrations continue, our QCT segment’s revenues will continue to depend largely upon, and be impacted by, future purchases and the timing and size of any such future purchases by these significant customers.In addition, one of our largest customers purchases our Mobile Data Modem (MDM) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology. To the extent such customer takes device share from our other customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, which have higher revenue and margin contribution than our MDM products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted. Further, companies that develop HLOS for devices, including leading technology companies, now sell their own devices. If we fail to effectively partner or continue partnering with these companies, or with their partners or customers, they may decide not to purchase (either directly or through their contract manufacturers), or to reduce or discontinue their purchases of, our integrated circuit products.In addition, there has been and continues to be litigation among certain of our customers and other industry participants, and the potential outcomes of such litigation, including but not limited to injunctions against devices that incorporate our products and/or intellectual property or rulings on certain patent law or patent licensing issues that create new legal precedent, could impact our business, particularly if such action impacts one of our larger customers.Although we have more than 285 CDMA-based licensees, our QTL segment derives a significant portion of licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and/or payment requirements or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of such license agreements, our revenues, operating results and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We have little or no control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our major licensees, without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues. 19Efforts by some communications equipment manufacturers or their customers to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions and/or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.From time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to renegotiate, mitigate and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity and/or unenforceability of our patents and/or licenses, or some form of unfair competition; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and other organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the imposition of some form of compulsory licensing and/or to weaken a patent holder’s ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) licensees using various strategies to attempt to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers that results in lowering the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price on which the royalty is calculated. In addition, particularly in China, certain licensees have disputed or underreported royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us, and certain companies have yet to enter into or delayed entering into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and such licensees and/or companies may continue to do so in the future. Further, to the extent such licensees and/or companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting and/or non-reporting on our business and operating results will be exacerbated.We are currently subject to various litigation and governmental investigations and/or proceedings, some of which may arise out of the strategies described above. Certain legal matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Depending on the type of matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices.In addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products (standard-essential patents) on terms that are fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these FRAND commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our patent portfolio.Further, some companies or entities have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and/or have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by severely limiting the base upon which the royalty percentage may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (and/or other companies’) alleged failure to abide by these policies.Some SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted and may in the future adopt some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party.We expect that such proposals, interpretations and strategies will continue in the future, and if successful, our business model would be harmed, either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalties on all or a portion of our patent portfolio, limiting our return on investment with respect to new technologies, limiting our ability to seek injunctions against infringers of our standard-essential patents, constraining our ability to make licensing commitments when submitting our technology for inclusion in future standards (which could make our technology less likely to be included in such standards) or forcing us to work outside of SDOs or other industry groups to promote our new technologies, and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. In addition, the legal and other costs associated with asserting or defending our 20positions have been and continue to be significant. We assume that such challenges, regardless of their merits, will continue into the foreseeable future and may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources.The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary intellectual property rights, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, or could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property rights or by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions.We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, international treaties and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and proprietary information is difficult and time consuming. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken, or may take in the future, have prevented or will prevent the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary intellectual property rights as fully or as readily as United States laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective. Some industry participants who have a vested interest in devaluing patents in general, or standard-essential patents in particular, have mounted attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established patent laws. In the United States, there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law changes. The laws in certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including certain countries in Asia, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States. We expect that the European Union will adopt a unitary patent system in the next few years that may broadly impact that region’s patent regime. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any potential changes. In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of any standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in the future in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our products or technology.We have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights and/or contracts, including collecting royalties for use of our patent portfolio in particular foreign jurisdictions due to, among others: policies of foreign governments; challenges to our licensing practices under such jurisdictions’ competition laws; adoption of mandatory licensing provisions by foreign jurisdictions (either with controlled/regulated royalties or royalty free); failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce judgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and/or challenges pending before foreign competition agencies to the pricing and integration of additional features and functionality into our chipset products. Particularly in China, certain licensees have disputed or underreported royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us, and certain companies have yet to enter into or delayed entering into license agreements for their use of our intellectual property, and such licensees and/or companies may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, although our license agreements provide us with the right to audit the books and records of licensees, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. Further, certain licensees may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their books and records. To the extent we do not aggressively enforce our rights under our license agreements, licensees may not comply with their existing license agreements, and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed companies to enter into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, other unlicensed companies may not enter into license agreements.We may need to litigate in the United States, China, India or elsewhere in the world to enforce our contract and/or intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable (which may in turn result in other licensees either not complying with their existing license agreements and/or initiating litigation) and/or we could incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our operating results. Further, even a positive resolution to our enforcement efforts may take time to conclude, which may reduce our revenues in the period prior to conclusion.The continued and future success of our licensing programs can be impacted by the deployment of other technologies in place of technologies based on CDMA, OFDMA and their derivatives; the need to extend certain existing license agreements that are expiring and/or to cover additional later patents; and/or the success of our licensing programs for 4G single mode products and emerging industry segments.Although we own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to GSM, GPRS, EDGE, OFDM, OFDMA, WLAN, MIMO and other technologies, our patent portfolio licensing program in these areas is less established and might not be as successful in generating licensing revenues as our CDMA licensing program has been. Many wireless 21operators are investigating, have selected or have deployed OFDMA-based LTE as their next-generation 4G technology in existing (or future if not yet deployed) wireless spectrum bands as complementary to their existing CDMA-based networks. While 3G/4G multimode products are generally covered by our existing 3G licensing agreements, products that implement 4G but do not also implement 3G are generally not covered by these agreements. Although we believe that our patented technology is essential and useful to implementation of the LTE industry standards and have granted royalty-bearing licenses to more than 155 companies (including Alcatel-Lucent, Huawei, LG, Microsoft, Samsung, Sony Mobile and ZTE) that have realized that they need a license to our patents to make and sell products implementing 4G standards but not implementing 3G standards, it may be difficult to agree on material terms and/or conditions of new license agreements that are acceptable to us with companies that are currently unlicensed, particularly in China. Further, the royalty rates for single mode 4G products are generally lower than our royalty rates for 3G and 3G/4G multimode products have been, and therefore, we might not achieve the same licensing revenues on such LTE products as on 3G and 3G/4G multimode products. In addition, new connectivity and other services are emerging that rely on devices that may or may not be used on traditional cellular networks, such as devices used in the connected home or the Internet of Things. We also seek to diversify and broaden our technology licensing programs to new industry segments in which we can utilize our technology leadership, such as wireless charging and other technologies. Standards, even de facto standards, that develop as these technologies mature, in particular those that do not include a base level of interoperability, may impact our ability to obtain royalties that are equivalent to those that we receive for 3G and 3G/4G multimode products used in cellular communications. Although we believe that our patented technology is essential and useful to the commercialization of such services, the royalties we receive may be lower than those we receive from our current licensing program.Over the long-term, we need to continue to evolve our patent portfolio. If we do not maintain a strong portfolio that is applicable to current and/or future products and/or services, our future licensing revenues could be negatively impacted.The licenses granted to and from us under a number of our license agreements include only patents that are either filed or issued prior to a certain date and, in a small number of agreements, royalties are payable on those patents for a specified time period. As a result, there are agreements with some licensees where later patents are not licensed by or to us and/or royalties are not owed to us under such license agreements after the specified time period. Additionally, certain license agreements are effective for a specified term. In order to license or to obtain a license to such later patents or after the expiration of a specified term, or to receive royalties after the specified time period, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. We might not be able to modify those license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, in the future without affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees, and such modifications or new agreements may negatively impact our revenues. If there is a delay in renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize revenues related to that licensee’s product sales. Further, if we are unable to reach agreement on such modifications or new agreements, it could result in patent infringement litigation with such companies.We are subject to government regulations and policies. Our business may suffer as a result of new or changed laws, regulations or policies, our failure or inability to comply with laws, regulations or policies or adverse rulings in enforcement or other proceedings.Our business, products and services, and those of our customers and licensees, are subject to various laws and regulations globally, as well as government policies and the specifications of international, national and regional communications standards bodies. The adoption of new laws, regulations or policies, changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations or policies, changes in the regulation of our activities by a government or standards body and/or adverse rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such laws, regulations or policies, including, among others, those affecting licensing practices, competitive business practices, the use of our technology or products, protection of intellectual property, trade, foreign investments or loans, spectrum availability and license issuance, adoption of standards, the provision of device subsidies by wireless operators to their customers, taxation, privacy and data protection, environmental protection or employment, could have an adverse effect on our business.We are currently subject to various governmental investigations and/or proceedings, and certain matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Depending on the type of matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices.Delays in government approvals or other governmental activities that could result from, among others, a decrease in or a lack of funding for certain agencies or branches of the government and/or political changes, could result in our incurring 22higher costs, could negatively impact our ability to timely consummate strategic transactions and/or could have other negative impacts on our business and the businesses of our customers and licensees.National, state and local environmental laws and regulations affect our operations around the world. These laws may make it more expensive to manufacture, have manufactured and sell products, and our costs could increase if our vendors (e.g., third-party manufacturers or utility companies) pass on their costs to us.Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or an adjoining country, or were from recycled or scrap sources. The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to determine that our products are “DRC conflict free,” we may face challenges with our customers that place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.Laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance, business conduct, public disclosure and health care are complex and changing and may create uncertainty regarding compliance. Laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases, and their application in practice may evolve over time. As a result, our efforts to comply may fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. New laws, regulations and standards or evolving interpretations of legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and/or procedures and may divert management time and attention to compliance activities.Our research, development and other investments in new technologies, products and services may not generate operating income or contribute to future operating results that meet our expectations.Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, and we must make substantial research, development and other investments, such as acquisitions, in new products, services and technologies to compete successfully. Technological innovations generally require significant research and development efforts before they are commercially viable. Our future growth significantly depends on third parties incorporating our technology, products and/or services into new device types used in industries beyond traditional cellular communications, such as automotive, connected home and wearable uses. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in developing new products, services and technologies that we believe can create stand-alone value and/or contribute to the success of our existing businesses. However, it is possible that these initiatives will not be successful and/or will not result in meaningful revenues or generate operating income that meets expectations. As a result, we may develop products that fail to meet our customers’ needs and/or develop products that may become obsolete and be replaced by competitors’ products offering more compelling features, technologies or costs.While we continue to focus our development efforts primarily in support of 3G CDMA- and 4G OFDMA-based technologies, we innovate across a broad spectrum of opportunities to deploy new business models and enter into new industry segments by leveraging our existing technical and business expertise and/or through acquisitions. Our recent investment initiatives relate to, among others, products for the connected home and the Internet of Things; automotive; networking; mobile computing; small cells and addressing the challenge of meeting the increased demand for data; very high speed connectivity; data centers; mobile health; wireless charging; and machine learning, including robotics. Our research, development and other investments in new technologies, products or services may not succeed due to, among others: improvements in alternate technologies in ways that reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors’ products or services being more cost effective, having more capabilities or fewer limitations or being brought to market faster than our new products and services; and competitors having longer operating histories in industry segments that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of or overestimate the future operating income and/or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns. If our new technologies, products or services are not successful, or are not successful in the time frame we anticipate, we may incur significant costs and/or asset impairments, our business may not grow as anticipated, our revenues and/or margins may be negatively impacted and/or our reputation may be harmed.We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture and testing of our products. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply assurance, technology leadership and low cost, our operating results and our business may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our operating results. Our QCT segment utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for 23delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party suppliers for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. The third-party semiconductor manufacturing foundries that supply products to our QCT segment are primarily located in Asia. The following could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands and/or negatively impact our revenues, business operations, profitability and/or cash flows:•a reduction, interruption, delay or limitation in our product supply sources;•a failure by our suppliers to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our products;•our suppliers’ inability to react to shifts in product demand or an increase in raw material or component prices;•the loss of a supplier or the inability of a supplier to meet performance or quality specifications or delivery schedules; and/or•additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier.While we have established alternate suppliers for certain technologies, we rely on sole- or limited-source suppliers for certain products, subjecting us to significant risks, including: possible shortages of raw materials or manufacturing capacity; poor product performance; and reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing capability and yields, quality assurance, quantity and costs. To the extent we have established alternate suppliers, these suppliers may require significant levels of support to bring complex technologies to production. As a result, we may invest a significant amount of effort and resources and incur higher costs to support and maintain such alternate suppliers. Further, any future consolidation of foundry suppliers could increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and reduce our suppliers’ willingness to negotiate pricing, which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reductions and/or increase our manufacturing costs. Our arrangements with our suppliers may obligate us to incur costs to manufacture and test our products that do not decrease at the same rate as decreases in pricing to our customers. Our ability, and that of our suppliers, to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies, and to effectively compete with the manufacturing processes and performance of our competitors, could impact our ability to introduce new products and meet customer demand, could increase our costs (possibly decreasing our margins) and could subject us to the risk of excess inventories. Our inability to meet customer demand due to sole- or limited-sourcing and/or the additional costs that we incur because of these or other supply constraints or because of the need to support alternate suppliers could negatively impact our business, our revenues and our results of operations.Although we have long-term contracts with our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific quantity, our suppliers may allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the production and testing of products for their other customers while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture or test our products. Accordingly, capacity for our products may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. To the extent we do obtain long-term capacity commitments, we may incur additional costs related to those commitments and/or make non-refundable payments for capacity commitments that are not used.One or more of our suppliers or potential alternate suppliers may manufacture CDMA- or OFDMA-based integrated circuits that compete with our products. In this event, the supplier could elect to allocate raw materials and manufacturing capacity to their own products and reduce or limit deliveries to us to our detriment. In addition, we may not receive reasonable pricing, manufacturing or delivery terms. We cannot guarantee that the actions of our suppliers will not cause disruptions in our operations that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers or increase our cost of sales.Additionally, we place orders with our suppliers using our forecasts of customer demand, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates, and are generally only partially covered by commitments from our customers. If we overestimate customer demand, we may experience increased excess and/or obsolete inventory, which would negatively impact our operating results. Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business.From time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights against our products or products using our technologies or other technologies used in our industry. These claims have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such litigation given, among other 24factors, the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products or services were found to infringe on another company’s intellectual property rights, we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our products or services, which could be costly, or to license such rights and/or pay damages or other compensation to such other company. If we are unable to redesign our products or services, license such intellectual property rights used in our products or services or otherwise distribute our products through a licensed supplier, we could be prohibited from making and selling such products or providing such services. In any potential dispute involving other companies’ patents or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers against certain types of liability and/or damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products or services sold or provided by us. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could hurt our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales and/or reductions in our licensees’ sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset and/or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delays, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.We expect that we may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages, royalty payments and/or an injunction on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (and on the sale of our customers’ devices using such products). A negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our chipset customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our worldwide chipset sales and/or a reduction in our licensees’ sales to wireless operators, causing corresponding declines in our chipset and/or licensing revenues.A number of other companies have claimed to own patents applicable to products implementing various CDMA-based standards, TDMA-based standards such as GSM and OFDMA-based standards. In addition, existing standards continue to evolve, and new standards, including those applicable to new industry segments, continue to be developed. If future standards diminish, or fail to include, a base level of interoperability, our business may be harmed, and our investments in these new segments may not succeed.We may engage in acquisitions or strategic transactions or make strategic investments that could adversely affect our financial results or fail to enhance stockholder value.We engage in acquisitions and strategic transactions and make strategic investments, which are important to our business strategy, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. We acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology, wireless spectrum and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions and purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening new or expanding opportunities for our technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services) for voice and data communications. Many of our acquisitions or strategic investments entail a high degree of risk and require the use of domestic and/or foreign capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our acquisitions or strategic investments may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies, products or services. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership interests. In addition, we may record impairment charges related to our acquisitions or strategic investments. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic investments or other transactions will have a negative impact on our financial results, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited.Achieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the acquired businesses in an efficient and effective manner. The integration of companies that have previously operated independently involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, business systems, technology and products; retaining customers and suppliers of the acquired business; consolidating research and development and/or supply operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures. We may not derive any commercial value from acquired technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on the acquired technologies, and we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain, or we may become subject 25to litigation. Additionally, we may not be successful in expanding into geographic regions and/or categories of products served by or adjacent to an acquired business or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of the combination. In part due to our inexperience with technologies and/or products of and/or geographic regions served by acquired businesses, we may underestimate the costs and/or overestimate the benefits, including product and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve them. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions, our results of operations may be adversely affected, and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transactions.If we are unsuccessful in executing our Strategic Realignment Plan, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.On July 22, 2015, we announced a Strategic Realignment Plan designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth as we work to create sustainable long-term value for stockholders. As part of this Strategic Realignment Plan, among other actions, we are implementing a cost reduction plan, which includes a series of targeted reductions across our businesses, particularly in our semiconductor business, QCT, and a reduction to our annual share-based compensation grants in fiscal 2016. We expect these cost reduction initiatives to be fully implemented by the end of fiscal 2016. Additional information regarding our Strategic Realignment Plan is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10. Strategic Realignment Plan.”We cannot provide assurance that our Strategic Realignment Plan will be successful, that anticipated cost savings will be realized, that our operations, business and financial results will improve and/or that these efforts will not disrupt our operations (beyond what is intended). Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits within the expected time frames is subject to many estimates and assumptions, which are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Further, we may experience delays in the timing of these efforts and/or higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing them. Moreover, changes in the size, alignment or organization of our workforce could adversely affect employee morale and retention, relations with customers and business partners, our ability to develop and deliver products and services as anticipated and/or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives. If we do not succeed in these efforts, if these efforts are more costly or time-consuming than expected, if our estimates and assumptions are not correct, if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.Our stock price and earnings are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market downturns.Our stock price and earnings have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock and/or earnings include those identified throughout this “Risk Factors” section, volatility of the stock market in general and technology-based companies in particular, announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers and variations between our actual results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts, among others. Further, increased volatility in the financial markets and/or overall economic conditions may reduce the amounts that we realize in the future on our cash equivalents and/or marketable securities and may reduce our earnings as a result of any impairment charges that we record to reduce recorded values of marketable securities to their fair values.In the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Due to changes in our stock price, we may be the target of securities litigation in the future. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s attention and our resources.There are risks associated with our indebtedness.Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have negative consequences, including, among others:•requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash flow available for other purposes;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends or other general corporate and other purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and/or•increasing our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations to the extent a portion of our debt has variable interest rates.Our ability to make payments of principal of and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, many of which are 26beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things: repatriate funds to the United States at substantial tax cost; refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such financing and/or refinancing are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such financing and/or refinancing would increase. If there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt in the future and/or the terms of the financing could be adversely affected.We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them, particularly in an environment of cost reductions, including equity compensation and headcount. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenues, harm our ability to collect receivables or increase the U.S. dollar cost of our products or the activities of our foreign subsidiaries and strategic investments.Our customers sell their products throughout the world in various currencies. Our consolidated revenues from international customers as a percentage of our total revenues were greater than 90% during each of the last three fiscal years. Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business and our operating results due to a number of factors, including, among others:•Our products and those of our customers and licensees that are sold outside the United States may become less price-competitive, which may result in reduced demand for those products and/or downward pressure on average selling prices;•Certain of our revenues, such as royalties, that are derived from licensee or customer sales denominated in foreign currencies could decrease;•Our foreign suppliers may raise their prices if they are impacted by currency fluctuations, resulting in higher than expected costs and lower margins; and/or•Foreign exchange hedging transactions that we engage in to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations may require the payment of structuring fees, limit the U.S. dollar value of royalties from licensees’ sales that are denominated in foreign currencies, cause earnings volatility if the hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting and expose us to counterparty risk if the counterparty fails to perform.Global economic conditions that impact the mobile communications industry could negatively affect the demand for our products and services and our customers’ or licensees’ products and services, which may negatively affect our revenues.A decline in global economic conditions or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users, could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on demand for our products and for the products and services of our customers or licensees, particularly equipment manufacturers or others in the wireless communications industry who buy their products, such as wireless operators. Any prolonged economic downturn may result in a decrease in demand for our products or technologies; the insolvency of key suppliers; delays in reporting and/or payments from our licensees and/or customers; failures by counterparties; and negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers’ ability to purchase or pay for our products and services and network operators’ ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be adversely affected by economic conditions, leading to a reduction, cancelation or delay of orders for our products or services.Failures in our products or services or in the products or services of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.The use of devices containing our products to access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system software in those devices to viral or malicious attacks. While we continue to focus on this issue and are taking measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities continue to evolve, enabling more data and processes, such as mobile computing, and increasing the risk of security failures. Further, our products are inherently complex and may contain defects 27or errors that are detected only when the products are in use. As our chipset product complexities increase, we are required to migrate to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes. The design process interface in new domains of technology is complex and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability. Further, manufacturing, testing, marketing and use of our products and those of our customers and licensees entail the risk of product liability. Because our products and services are responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products and/or networks, security failures, defects or errors in our products and services could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and on the end users of our customers’ products. Such adverse impact could include product liability claims or recalls, write-offs of our inventories and/or intangible assets; unfavorable purchase commitments; a shift of business to our competitors; a decrease in demand for connected devices and wireless services, damage to our reputation and to our customer relationships and other financial liability or harm to our business.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are increasingly more sophisticated. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we have identified several incidents of unauthorized access, to date none have caused material damage to our business. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives and/or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information, we may incur liability. We expect to continue to devote resources to the security of our information technology systems.Potential tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Singapore where our QCT segment’s non-United States headquarters is located. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could materially differ from amounts reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In such case, our income tax provision and results of operations in the period or periods in which that determination is made could be negatively affected.We have tax incentives in Singapore provided that we meet specified employment and other criteria, and as a result of expiration of these incentives, our Singapore tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal 2017 and again in fiscal 2027. If we do not meet the criteria required to retain such incentives, our Singapore tax rate could increase prior to those dates, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.Tax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. For example, we consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States based on our current needs for those earnings to be reinvested offshore as well as estimates that future domestic cash generated from operations and/or borrowings will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs for the foreseeable future. No provision has been made for United States federal, state or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries. Our future financial results and liquidity may be adversely affected if tax rules regarding unrepatriated earnings change, if domestic cash needs require us to repatriate foreign earnings, if the shares of these foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred or if the United States international tax rules change as part of comprehensive tax reform or other tax legislation. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the United States or Singapore, our operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition could be adversely affected.Item 1B.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIn addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report.OverviewFiscal 2015 OverviewThe transition of wireless networks and devices to 3G/4G (CDMA-based, OFDMA-based and CDMA/OFDMA multimode) continued around the world. 3G/4G connections increased to approximately 3.4 billion, up 22% year-over-year, and represent approximately 47% of total cellular connections, up from 40% at the end of fiscal 2014.(1) Revenues were $25.3 billion, a decrease of 5% compared to fiscal 2014, with net income attributable to Qualcomm of $5.3 billion, a decrease of 34% compared to fiscal 2014.QCT Segment. We shipped approximately 932 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) integrated circuits for CDMA- and OFDMA-based wireless devices, an increase of 8%, compared to approximately 861 million MSM integrated circuits in fiscal 2014. However, despite the increase in MSM integrated circuit shipments, QCT’s revenues decreased by 8%, and its earnings before taxes as a percentage of revenues decreased to 14% from 20% in fiscal 2014, primarily due to the effects of a shift in share among our customers within the premium tier, which reduced our sales of integrated Snapdragon processors and skewed our product mix towards lower-margin modem chipsets in this tier, a decline in share at a large customer and the competitive environment in China. On August 13, 2015, we acquired CSR plc for total cash consideration of $2.3 billion, net of cash acquired. CSR, which was integrated into the QCT segment, is an innovator in the development of multifunction semiconductor platforms and technologies for the automotive, consumer and voice and music categories. The acquisition complements our current offerings by adding products, channels and customers in the growth categories of the Internet of Things and automotive infotainment.QTL Segment. Total reported device sales(2) by licensees were approximately $250.9 billion in fiscal 2015, an increase of approximately 3%, compared to approximately $243.6 billion in fiscal 2014. Our total reported device sales and QTL’s results of operations were negatively impacted by units that we believe are not being reported to us by certain licensees and sales of certain unlicensed products in China. In the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded and paid a $975 million fine after reaching a resolution with the China National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) regarding its investigation of us under China’s Anti-Monopoly Law. Despite the resolution of the NDRC investigation, China continues to present significant challenges for us as we believe that certain licensees in China are not fully complying with their contractual obligations to report their sales of licensed products to us, and certain companies, including unlicensed companies, are delaying execution of new license agreements. We continue to make progress with licensees executing agreements based on the new China terms and with several other licensees informing us that they intend to retain the terms of their existing agreements. Negotiations with certain other licensees and unlicensed companies are ongoing, and we expect it will take some time to conclude these negotiations. Strategic Realignment Plan. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we announced a Strategic Realignment Plan designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth as we work to create sustainable long-term value for stockholders. During fiscal 2015, we recorded restructuring and restructuring-related charges of $190 million related to the plan. Capital Return Program. On March 9, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to $15 billion of our common stock. We intend to return a minimum of 75% of our free cash flow(3) to stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends over the foreseeable future. Additionally, we announced our intention to repurchase $10 billion of stock from March 2015 through March 2016. In fiscal 2015, we completed $8.1 billion of repurchases towards our $10 billion stock repurchase commitment, which includes the completion of our $5.0 billion accelerated share repurchase agreements. Excluding these stock repurchases, we returned $6.0 billion, or 134% of free cash flow, to stockholders, including $3.1 billion through repurchases of common stock and $2.9 billion of cash dividends. Shares outstanding decreased by 9% to 1.52 billion at September 27, 2015 from 1.67 billion at September 28, 2014 due to share repurchases, partially offset by net shares issued under our employee benefit plans. 32To support our capital return program and for other general corporate purposes, in May 2015, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes, with maturity dates in 2018 through 2045 and effective interest rates between 0.43% and 4.74%. (1)According to GSMA Intelligence estimates as of November 2, 2015 for the quarter ended September 30, 2015 (estimates excluded Wireless Local Loop).(2)Total reported device sales is the sum of all reported sales in U.S. dollars (as reported to us by our licensees) of all licensed CDMA-based, OFDMA-based and CDMA/OFDMA multimode subscriber devices (including handsets, modules, modem cards and other subscriber devices) by our licensees during a particular period (collectively, 3G/4G devices). Not all licensees report sales the same way (e.g., some licensees report sales net of permitted deductions, including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items, while other licensees report sales and then identify the amount of permitted deductions in their reports), and the way in which licensees report such information may change from time to time. In addition, certain licensees may not report (in the quarter in which they are contractually obligated to report) their sales of certain types of subscriber units, which (as a result of audits, legal actions or for other reasons) may be reported in a subsequent quarter. Accordingly, total reported device sales for a particular period may include prior period activity that was not reported by the licensee until such particular period.(3)Free cash flow, a non-GAAP financial measure, is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. See “Non-GAAP Financial Information.”Our Business and Operating SegmentsWe design, manufacture, have manufactured on our behalf and market digital communications products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents, software and other rights. We have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through two reportable segments: QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing), and our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. Our reportable segments are operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.QCT is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies for use in voice and data communications, networking, application processing, multimedia and global positioning system products. QCT’s integrated circuit products are sold and its system software is licensed to manufacturers that use our products in wireless devices, particularly mobile phones, tablets, laptops, data modules, handheld wireless computers and gaming devices, access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment, and in wired devices, particularly broadband gateway equipment, desktop computers and streaming media players. Our MSM integrated circuits, which include the Mobile Data Modem, Qualcomm Single Chip and Qualcomm Snapdragon processors and LTE modems, perform the core baseband modem functionality in wireless devices providing voice and data communications, as well as multimedia applications and global positioning functions. In addition, our Snapdragon processors provide advanced application and graphics processing capabilities. QCT’s system software enables the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. QCT revenues comprised 68%, 70% and 67% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.QCT utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the package assembly and test manufacturing processes. We rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party suppliers for manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test.QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, 33including, without limitation, products implementing CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD and/or LTE standards and their derivatives. QTL licensing revenues include license fees and royalties based on sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items). QTL recognizes royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees and when other revenue recognition criteria are met. Licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter. QTL revenues comprised 31%, 29% and 30% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues were generated through our licensees’ sales of CDMA2000- and WCDMA-based products, such as feature phones and smartphones.QSI makes strategic investments that are focused on opening new or expanding opportunities for our technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services) for voice and data communications. Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries, including, but not limited to, digital media, e-commerce, healthcare and wearable devices. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity instruments, which generally are recorded using the cost method or the equity method, and convertible debt instruments, which are recorded at fair value. QSI also holds wireless spectrum, which at September 27, 2015 consisted of L-Band spectrum in the United Kingdom that was subsequently sold in October 2015 for an estimated gain of approximately $380 million. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with development contracts with one of our equity method investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future. Nonreportable segments include our small cells, data center and other wireless technology and service initiatives. Seasonality. Many of our products or intellectual property are incorporated into consumer wireless devices, which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand. As a result, QCT has tended historically to have stronger sales toward the end of the calendar year as manufacturers prepare for major holiday selling seasons; and because QTL recognizes royalty revenues when royalties are reported by licensees, QTL has tended to record higher royalty revenues in the first calendar quarter when licensees report their sales made during the fourth calendar quarter. We have also experienced fluctuations in revenues due to the timing of conversions and expansions of 3G and 3G/4G networks by wireless operators and the timing of launches of flagship wireless devices that incorporate our products and/or intellectual property. These trends may or may not continue in the future. Discontinued Operations On November 25, 2013, we completed our sale of the North and Latin America operations of our Omnitracs division to a U.S.-based private equity firm for cash consideration of $788 million (net of cash sold). As a result, we recorded a gain in discontinued operations of $665 million ($430 million net of income tax expense) during fiscal 2014. The revenues and operating results of the North and Latin America operations of the Omnitracs division, which comprised substantially all of the Omnitracs division, were not presented as discontinued operations in any fiscal period because they were immaterial.Looking ForwardWe expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G products and services around the world, driven primarily by smartphones. We also expect growth in new device categories and industries, driven by the expanding adoption of certain technologies that are already commonly used in smartphones. As we look forward to the next several months, we expect our business to be impacted by the following key items:•Our business has been impacted by changing industry dynamics, including: an increased shift in share among our customers within the premium tier, which will continue to negatively impact sales of our integrated Snapdragon processors and skew our product mix towards lower-margin modem chipsets in this tier; an increased use of internally-developed integrated circuit products by certain of our OEM (original equipment manufacturer) customers, which has led to a decline in share at a large customer; and the acceleration of intense competition in the low-tier, particularly in China. We anticipate that our results of operations, particularly for our semiconductor business, QCT, will continue to be adversely impacted by these factors into the next fiscal year. •China continues to present significant opportunities for us, particularly with the rollout of 3G/4G LTE multimode. We expect the rollout of 4G services in China will encourage competition and growth, bring the benefits of 3G/4G LTE multimode to consumers, encourage consumers to replace 2G (GSM) and 3G devices and enable new opportunities beyond mobile applications (e.g., machine-to-machine). 34•In February 2015, we reached a resolution with the NDRC regarding its investigation and agreed to implement a rectification plan that modifies certain of our business practices in China. The rectification plan provides, among other things, that for licenses of only our 3G and 4G essential Chinese patents for branded devices sold for use in China starting on January 1, 2015 (and reported to us starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2015), we will charge running royalties at royalty rates of 5% for 3G CDMA or WCDMA devices (including multimode 3G/4G devices) and 3.5% for 4G devices that do not implement CDMA or WCDMA (including 3-mode LTE-TDD devices), in each case using a royalty base of 65% of the net selling price.•Despite the resolution of the NDRC investigation, China continues to present significant challenges for us. We continue to believe that certain licensees in China are not fully complying with their contractual obligations to report their sales of licensed products to us (which includes 3G/4G units that we believe are not being reported by certain licensees), and certain companies, including unlicensed companies, are delaying execution of new license agreements. We continue to make progress with licensees executing agreements based on the new China terms and with several other licensees informing us that they intend to retain the terms of their existing agreements. Negotiations with certain other licensees and unlicensed companies are ongoing, and we expect it will take some time to conclude these negotiations. We believe that the conclusion of new agreements with these licensees will result in improved reporting by these licensees, including with respect to sales of three-mode devices (i.e., devices that implement GSM, TD-SCDMA and LTE-TDD) sold in China. However, litigation and/or other actions may be necessary to compel licensees to report and pay the required royalties for sales they have not previously reported and to compel unlicensed companies to execute new licenses. •We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements in 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G LTE technologies, OFDM-based WLAN technologies, audio and video codecs, wireless baseband chips, our converged computing/communications (Snapdragon) chips, graphics, connectivity, multimedia products, software and services. We are also investing in targeted opportunities that utilize our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and enter into new industry segments, such as products for the connected home and the Internet of Things; automotive; networking; mobile computing; small cells and addressing the challenge of meeting the increased demand for data; very high speed connectivity; data centers; mobile health; wireless charging; and machine learning, including robotics.•We expect that the increased availability of low-tier 3G/4G smartphone products will help enable further expansion of 3G and 3G/4G multimode in emerging regions, particularly in China.•We expect that 3G/4G device prices will continue to vary broadly due to the increased penetration of smartphones combined with competition throughout the world at all price tiers. Additionally, varying rates of economic growth by region and stronger growth of device shipments in emerging regions as compared to developed regions, are expected to continue to impact the average and range of selling prices of 3G/4G devices.•In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we announced a Strategic Realignment Plan designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth as we work to create sustainable long-term value for stockholders. The core elements of this plan include: (a) right-sizing our cost structure; (b) reviewing alternatives to our corporate and financial structure; (c) reaffirming our plan to return significant capital to stockholders; (d) adding new Directors with complementary skills while reducing the average tenure of our Board of Directors; (e) further aligning executive compensation with performance and stockholder return objectives; and (f) making disciplined investments in areas that build upon our core technologies and capabilities and offer attractive growth opportunities and returns. •In order to right-size our cost structure, we are planning to reduce our annual costs from fiscal 2015 levels (adjusted for variable compensation) of $7.3 billion (as announced on July 22, 2015) by approximately $1.1 billion through a series of targeted reductions across Qualcomm’s businesses, particularly in QCT. We also plan to reduce annual share-based compensation grants by approximately $300 million. We expect these cost reduction initiatives to be fully implemented by the end of fiscal 2016. In connection with this plan, we expect to incur approximately $350 million to $450 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges, of which $190 million were incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Restructuring and restructuring-related charges include severance costs, asset impairment charges, consultancy fees, lease termination costs, acceleration of depreciation and other costs. In addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless value chain and governments as to the benefits of our business model and our extensive technology investments in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry. However, we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not 35welcome the success of our business model in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. We expect that such companies and/or governments or regulators will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world.Further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the Risk Factors included in this Annual Report.Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Although we believe that our estimates and the assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, actual results that differ from our estimates could be material to our consolidated financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies.” We consider the following accounting estimates to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.Impairment of Marketable Securities. We hold investments in marketable securities, with increases and decreases in fair value generally recorded through stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income or loss. We record impairment charges through the statement of operations when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring recognition of impairment losses. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; how long the market value of the security has been less than its cost basis; the security’s relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; expected market volatility; the market and economy in general; analyst recommendations and price targets; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates, as applicable. If we determine that a security price decline is other than temporary, we record an impairment loss, which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded $163 million, $156 million and $72 million, respectively, in impairment losses on our investments in marketable securities.Valuation of Inventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (replacement cost, not to exceed net realizable value) using the first-in, first-out method. Recoverability of inventories is assessed based on review of future customer demand that considers multiple factors, including committed purchase orders from customers as well as purchase commitment projections provided by customers, among other things. This valuation also requires us to make judgments and assumptions based on information currently available about market conditions, including competition, product pricing, product life cycle and development plans. If we overestimate demand for our products, the amount of our loss will be impacted by our contractual ability to reduce inventory purchases from our suppliers. Our assumptions of future product demand are inherently uncertain, and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. We also acquire intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in other types of transactions. The determination of the recorded value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. For intangible assets acquired in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred (or the estimated fair values of the assets received, if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values, unless the values of neither the assets received nor the assets transferred are determinable within reasonable limits, in which case the assets received are measured based on the carrying values of the assets transferred. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. An estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions that require significant judgment. For example, the income approach generally requires us to use assumptions to estimate future cash flows including those related to total addressable market, pricing and share forecasts, competition, technology obsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of certain assets may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models. 36Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets may be based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions, expected selling price and/or other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning, when appropriate. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on a portion or all of our goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and/or long-lived assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. During fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, we recorded $317 million, $642 million and $192 million, respectively, in impairment charges for goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets. The estimated fair values of our QCT and QTL reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values at September 27, 2015. Legal Proceedings. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves. However, the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. A broad range of remedies with respect to our business practices that are deemed to violate applicable laws are potentially available. These remedies may include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or to modify our business practices. We disclose a loss contingency if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred. We record our best estimate of a loss related to pending legal proceedings when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Where a range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability, including the probability of loss related to pending legal proceedings, and revise our estimates and update our disclosures accordingly. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations. Income Taxes. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes, including those related to tax incentives, intercompany research and development cost-sharing arrangements, transfer pricing and tax credits. In addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by taxing authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We are participating in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Compliance Assurance Process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the IRS on the treatment of all issues prior to filing our federal return. A benefit of participation in this program is that post-filing adjustments by the IRS are less likely to occur.Our QCT segment’s non-United States headquarters is located in Singapore. We obtained tax incentives in Singapore that commenced in March 2012, including a tax exemption for the first five years, provided that we meet specified employment and incentive criteria, and as a result of expiration of these incentives, our Singapore tax rate will increase in fiscal 2017 and again in fiscal 2027. Our failure to meet these criteria could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States based on our plans for use and/or investment outside of the United States and our belief that our sources of cash and liquidity in the United States will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. On a regular basis, we consider projected cash needs for, among other things, investments in our existing businesses, future research and development, potential acquisitions and capital transactions, including repurchases of our common stock, dividends and debt repayments. We estimate the amount of cash or other liquidity that is available or needed in the jurisdictions where these investments are expected as well as our ability to generate cash in those jurisdictions and our access to capital markets. This analysis enables us to conclude whether or not we will indefinitely reinvest the current period’s foreign earnings. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $10.2 billion related to the United States federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $28.8 billion of undistributed earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Should we decide to no longer indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the United States, for example, if we determine that such earnings are needed to fund future domestic operations or there is 37not a sufficient need for such earnings outside of the United States, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we make such determination.Results of OperationsRevenues (in millions)Year Ended September 27, 2015 September 28, 2014 September 29, 2013 2015 vs. 2014 Change 2014 vs. 2013 ChangeEquipment and services$17,079 $18,625 $16,988 $(1,546) $1,637Licensing8,202 7,862 7,878 340 (16) $25,281 $26,487 $24,866 $(1,206) $1,621The decrease and increase in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively, were primarily due to a decrease and an increase in QCT revenues of $1.49 billion and $1.94 billion, respectively. The increase in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2014 was partially offset by a decrease of $305 million as a result of the sale of our Omnitracs division during fiscal 2014. The increase in our licensing revenues in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in QTL revenues of $378 million. The decrease in our licensing revenues in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to a decrease in a nonreportable segment’s revenues of $32 million, partially offset by an increase in QTL revenues of $15 million.QCT and QTL segment revenues related to the products of Samsung Electronics and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd/Foxconn, its affiliates and other suppliers to Apple Inc. comprised 45%, 49% and 43% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Revenues from customers in China, South Korea and Taiwan comprised 53%, 16% and 13%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2015, compared to 50%, 23% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2014, and 49%, 20% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2013. We report revenues from external customers by country based on the location to which our products or services are delivered, which for QCT is generally the country in which our customers manufacture their products, or for licensing revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees. As a result, the revenues by country presented herein are not necessarily indicative of either the country in which the devices containing our products and/or intellectual property are ultimately sold to consumers or the country in which the companies that sell the devices are headquartered. For example, China revenues would include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.Costs and Expenses (in millions)Year Ended September 27, 2015 September 28, 2014 September 29, 2013 2015 vs. 2014 Change 2014 vs. 2013 ChangeCost of equipment and services (E&S) revenues$10,378 $10,686 $9,820 $(308) $866Cost as % of E&S revenues61% 57% 58% The decrease in margin percentage in fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to a decrease in QCT gross margin percentage. The increase in margin percentage in fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to a net decrease in gross margin losses incurred by our nonreportable segments, partially offset by a decrease in QCT’s gross margin percentage. Our margin percentage may continue to fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of products sold and services provided, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors.

The increase in fiscal 2015 was partially offset by a decrease of $72 million related to the development costs of display technologies and additional decreases related to the development costs of other new product and licensing initiatives.The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to increases of $73 million in selling and marketing expenses and $46 million in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, partially offset by decreases of $49 million in employee-related expenses and $13 million in share-based compensation. The dollar decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2014 was primarily attributable to decreases of $59 million in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, $53 million in share-based compensation, $53 million in selling and marketing expenses and $22 million in employee-related expenses. The decrease in employee-related expenses and a portion of the decrease in share-based compensation in fiscal 2014 were due to the sale of our Omnitracs division during fiscal 2014.Other expenses in fiscal 2015 were attributable to a $975 million charge resulting from the resolution reached with the NDRC, charges of $255 million and $11 million for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively, related to our content and push-to-talk services and display businesses and $190 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Strategic Realignment Plan, partially offset by $138 million in gains on sales of certain property plant and equipment. Other expenses in fiscal 2014 were comprised of $607 million in certain property, plant and equipment and goodwill impairment charges and $19 million in restructuring-related costs incurred by one of our display businesses, a $16 million goodwill impairment charge related to our former QRS (Qualcomm Retail Solutions) division and a $15 million legal settlement, partially offset by the reversal of a $173 million expense accrual recorded in fiscal 2013 related to the ParkerVision verdict against us, which was overturned. Other expenses in fiscal 2013 were comprised of the $173 million ParkerVision charge and a $158 million impairment charge related to certain long-lived assets of one our display businesses.Interest Expense and Net Investment Income (in millions) Year Ended September 27, 2015 September 28, 2014 September 29, 2013 2015 vs. 2014 Change 2014 vs. 2013 ChangeInterest expense$104 $5 $23 $99 $(18) Investment income, net Interest and dividend income$527 $586 $697 $(59) $(111)Net realized gains on marketable securities451 770 317 (319) 453Net realized gains on other investments49 56 52 (7) 4Impairment losses on marketable securities and other investments(200) (180) (85) (20) (95)Other(12) 1 6 (13) (5) $815 $1,233 $987 $(418) $246The increase in interest expense in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the issuance of an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion in floating- and fixed-rate notes in May 2015. Due to portfolio rebalancing in fiscal 2014 and 2015, we earned lower interest and dividend income on cash and cash equivalents and recorded lower realized gains on marketable securities balances in fiscal 2015. We expect to earn lower interest and dividend income and record lower realized gains in fiscal 2016 as a result of our rebalancing, among other factors. In fiscal 2014, we rebalanced our marketable securities portfolio, which resulted in lower interest and dividend income, due to lower interest rates, and higher net realized gains on marketable securities, compared to fiscal 2013. The increase in impairment losses on marketable securities and other investments in fiscal 2014 was primarily due to an increase in our recognition of unrealized losses on marketable debt securities that we intended to sell or that we more likely than not would 39sell before recovery, which was also impacted by our portfolio rebalancing.

Additionally, during fiscal 2015, we recorded a tax benefit of $101 million related to fiscal 2014 resulting from the United States government reinstating the federal research and development tax credit retroactively to January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 also reflected the United States federal research and development tax credit generated through December 31, 2014, the date on which the credit expired, and a $61 million tax benefit as a result of a favorable tax audit settlement with the Internal Revenue Service related to Qualcomm Atheros, Inc.’s pre-acquisition 2010 and 2011 tax returns. The effective tax rate for our state income tax provision, net of federal benefit, was negligible for all years presented. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 reflected the tax benefit from the United States federal research and development tax credit generated through December 31, 2013, the date on which the credit previously expired. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 also reflected a tax benefit of $66 million related to fiscal 2013 resulting from an agreement reached with the Internal Revenue Service on components of our fiscal 2013 tax return. Additionally, the effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013 reflected increased foreign earnings taxed at less than the United States federal rate. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 reflected a tax benefit of $64 million related to fiscal 2012 resulting from the retroactive extension of the United States federal research and development tax credit.Our Segment ResultsThe following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 financial results for each reportable segment included in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.”(in millions)QCT QTL QSI2015 Revenues$17,154 $7,947 $4EBT (1)2,465 6,882 (74)EBT as a % of revenues14% 87% 2014 Revenues$18,665 $7,569 $—EBT (1)3,807 6,590 (7)EBT as a % of revenues20% 87% 2013 Revenues$16,715 $7,554 $—EBT (1)3,189 6,590 56EBT as a % of revenues19% 87% 40(1)Earnings (loss) before taxes.QCT Segment. QCT results of operations in fiscal 2015 were negatively impacted by the effects of a shift in share among our customers within the premium tier, which reduced our sales of integrated Snapdragon processors and skewed our product mix towards lower-margin modem chipsets in this tier, a decline in share at a large customer and the competitive environment in China. The decrease and increase in QCT revenues in fiscal 2015 and 2014 of $1.51 billion and $1.95 billion, respectively, were primarily due to changes in equipment and services revenues. Equipment and services revenues, mostly related to sales of MSM and accompanying RF and PM integrated circuits, were $16.95 billion, $18.43 billion and $16.49 billion in fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The decrease in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2015 resulted primarily from a decrease of $2.89 billion from lower-priced product mix and lower average selling prices, partially offset by an increase of $1.26 billion related to higher MSM and accompanying RF and PM unit shipments. The increase in equipment and services revenues in 2014 resulted primarily from increases of $2.66 billion related to higher MSM and accompanying RF and PM unit shipments and $203 million related to sales of connectivity products, partially offset by a net decrease of $1.08 billion resulting from lower average selling prices offset by higher-priced product mix. Approximately 932 million, 861 million and 716 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to decreases in gross margin percentage and the related impact of lower revenues relative to operating expenses. The decrease in QCT gross margin percentage in fiscal 2015 primarily resulted from lower average selling prices and lower-margin product mix, partially offset by lower average unit costs. QCT gross margin percentage in fiscal 2015 was also impacted by an increase of $179 million in excess inventory charges. QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues increased in fiscal 2014 as compared to fiscal 2013. During fiscal 2014, QCT revenues increased 12% relative to a combined increase of 5% in research and development expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses, whereas gross margin percentage decreased as a result of lower average selling prices and lower-margin product mix, partially offset by lower average unit costs.QTL Segment. The increases in QTL revenues in fiscal 2015 and 2014 of $378 million and $15 million, respectively, were primarily due to increases in sales of CDMA-based products, including multimode products that also implement OFDMA, reported by licensees, partially offset by decreases in revenues per reported unit. QTL revenues and EBT in fiscal 2015 continued to be impacted negatively by units that we believe are not being reported by certain licensees and sales of certain unlicensed products in China. We expect it will take some time for those certain licensees to fully comply with the reporting requirements of their license agreements and for unlicensed companies that had delayed execution of new licenses pending resolution of the NDRC investigation to execute new licenses. Also in fiscal 2015, QTL experienced negative fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. QTL revenues and EBT for fiscal 2014 were impacted by units that we believe were being underreported by certain licensees, a dispute with a licensee and sales of certain unlicensed products in China. QSI Segment. The decrease in QSI EBT in fiscal 2015 of $67 million was primarily due to increases of $32 million in impairment losses on investments and $29 million in equity losses and other costs related to our equity method investments. The decrease in QSI EBT in fiscal 2014 of $63 million was primarily due to a $39 million decrease in net realized gains on investments and a $35 million increase in impairment losses on investments, partially offset by a $16 million decrease in interest expense related to our former subsidiaries that held Broadband Wireless Access spectrum in India. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, cash provided by our debt programs and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. The following table presents selected financial information related to our liquidity as of and for the years ended September 27, 2015 and September 28, 2014 (in millions): 41 2015 2014 $ Change % ChangeCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$30,947 $32,022 $(1,075) (3%)Accounts receivable, net1,964 2,412 (448) (19%)Inventories1,492 1,458 34 2%Short-term debt1,000 — 1,000 Long-term debt9,969 — 9,969 Net cash provided by operating activities5,506 8,887 (3,381) (38%)Net cash used by investing activities(3,572) (1,639) (1,933) Net cash used by financing activities(2,261) (5,480) 3,219 The net decrease in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily the result of $11.2 billion in payments to repurchase shares of our common stock, including the $5.0 billion accelerated share repurchase agreements, partially offset by $9.9 billion in proceeds from the issuance of notes and net cash provided by operating activities. Total cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to a reduction in net income of $2.7 billion and prepayment of $950 million to secure long-term capacity commitments at a supplier of our integrated circuit products. The decrease in accounts receivable was primarily due to lower revenues related to sales of integrated circuits, partially offset by the timing of payments from certain of our licensees. Our day sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, increased to 33 days at September 27, 2015 compared to 32 days at September 28, 2014, primarily due to the timing of cash payments from certain of our licensees, partially offset by the timing of customer payments for receivables related to integrated circuits. The increase in inventories was primarily due to increases in work-in-process and finished goods inventories in connection with the CSR acquisition, including a step-up in the fair value of the acquired inventories, partially offset by a decrease in other QCT inventories resulting primarily from lower-cost product mix and lower average unit costs.We classify certain of our marketable securities as short-term based on their nature and our plan to make them available, if needed, for use in our current operations. While we do not anticipate using our non-current marketable securities in operations in the foreseeable future, the securities could be liquidated within a short period of time if required. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 27, 2015 consisted of $5.3 billion held by United States-based entities and $25.6 billion held by foreign entities. Most of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign entities are indefinitely reinvested and would be subject to material tax effects if repatriated. However, we believe that our United States sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the United States and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds. We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our expected cash flow generated from operations and our expected financing activities will satisfy our working and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months based on our current business plans. Recent and expected working and other capital requirements also include the items described below.•In connection with our Strategic Realignment Plan, we expect to incur a total of approximately $350 million to $450 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges, the majority of which will result in future cash payments. •Our purchase obligations at September 27, 2015, some of which relate to research and development activities and capital expenditures, totaled $3.0 billion and $953 million for fiscal 2016 and 2017, respectively, and $1.6 billion thereafter. •Our research and development expenditures were $5.5 billion during fiscal 2015 and 2014, and we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development for new technologies, applications and services for voice and data communications, primarily in the wireless industry.•Cash outflows for capital expenditures were $994 million and $1.2 billion during fiscal 2015 and 2014, respectively. We expect to continue to incur capital expenditures in the future to support our business, including research and development activities. Future capital expenditures may be impacted by transactions that are currently not forecasted.•We expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions, the amounts of which could vary significantly, to open new opportunities for our technologies, obtain development resources, grow our patent portfolio or pursue new businesses. 42Debt. In February 2015, we entered into a Revolving Credit Facility that provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing line loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $4.0 billion, expiring in February 2020. At September 27, 2015, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.In March 2015, we began an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $4.0 billion of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. At September 27, 2015, we had $1.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding with weighted-average net interest rates of 0.19% and weighted-average remaining days to maturity of 38 days.In May 2015, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion in eight tranches of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes, with maturity dates in 2018 through 2045 and effective interest rates between 0.43% and 4.74%. Interest is payable in arrears quarterly for the floating-rate notes and semi-annually for the fixed-rate notes. Net proceeds from the issuance of the notes of $9.9 billion were used to fund two accelerated share repurchase agreements and are being used for other general corporate purposes. We may issue additional debt in the future. The amount and timing of additional borrowings will be subject to a number of factors, including the cash flow generated by United States-based entities, acquisitions and strategic investments, acceptable interest rates and changes in corporate income tax law, among other factors. Additional information regarding our outstanding debt at September 27, 2015 is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6. Debt.” Capital Return Program. The following table summarizes stock repurchases and dividends paid during fiscal 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in millions, except per-share amounts): Stock Repurchase Program Dividends Total Shares Average Price Paid Per Share Amount Per Share Amount Amount2015 172.4 $65.21 $11,245 $1.80 $2,880 $14,1252014 60.3 75.48 4,548 1.54 2,586 7,1342013 71.7 64.28 4,609 1.20 2,055 6,664We intend to return a minimum of 75% of our free cash flow to stockholders through stock repurchases and dividends over the foreseeable future, where free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. On March 9, 2015, we announced that we had been authorized to repurchase up to $15 billion of our common stock. Additionally, we announced our intention to repurchase $10 billion of stock from March 2015 through March 2016. In May 2015, we entered into two accelerated share repurchase agreements (ASR Agreements) to repurchase an aggregate of $5.0 billion of our common stock. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, the ASR Agreements were completed, and a total of 78.3 million shares were delivered to us under the ASR Agreements based on the combined volume-weighted average stock price over the terms of the ASR agreements. At September 27, 2015, $6.9 billion remained authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program. To meet our remaining goal, we expect to use existing cash and marketable securities (which include the proceeds from the May 2015 debt offering) held by, and cash flow generated from, United States-based entities. Since September 27, 2015, we repurchased and retired 24.6 million shares of common stock for $1.4 billion. We periodically evaluate repurchases as a means of returning capital to stockholders to determine when and if repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders.On October 9, 2015, we announced a cash dividend of $0.48 per share on our common stock, payable on December 18, 2015 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 1, 2015. We intend to continue to use cash dividends as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.Contractual Obligations/Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K 303(a)(4)(ii). 43The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal period for our outstanding contractual obligations at September 27, 2015 (in millions): Total 2016 2017-2018 2019-2020 Beyond2020 NoExpirationDatePurchase obligations (1)$5,601 $3,017 $1,695 $880 $9 $—Operating lease obligations281 99 114 44 24 —Equity funding and financing commitments (2)132 82 32 — 15 3Long-term debt10,000 — 1,500 2,000 6,500 —Other long-term liabilities (3)(4)246 2 124 110 5 5Total contractual obligations$16,260 $3,200 $3,465 $3,034 $6,553 $8(1)Total purchase obligations include commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories of $2.5 billion, $787 million, $706 million, $680 million and $166 million for each of the subsequent five years from fiscal 2016 through 2020, respectively; there were no such purchase commitments thereafter. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments for semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancelation of outstanding purchase orders is generally allowed but requires payment of all costs incurred through the date of cancelation, and in some cases, incremental fees related to capacity underutilization. (2)Certain of these commitments do not have fixed funding dates and are subject to certain conditions. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be funded under these arrangements; actual funding may be in lesser amounts or not at all.(3)Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenues, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. Other long-term liabilities as presented in this table include the related current portions.(4)Our consolidated balance sheet at September 27, 2015 included $23 million in noncurrent liabilities for uncertain tax positions, some of which may result in cash payment. The future payments related to uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities.Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 27, 2015 is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3. Income Taxes,” “Note 6. Debt” and “Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”Recent Accounting PronouncementsIn May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which outlines a comprehensive revenue recognition model and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance. The new standard requires a company to recognize revenue upon transfer of goods or services to a customer at an amount that reflects the expected consideration to be received in exchange for those goods or services. ASU 2014-09 defines a five-step approach for recognizing revenue, which may require a company to use more judgment and make more estimates than under the current guidance. This ASU, as amended, will be effective for us starting in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. The FASB will also permit entities to adopt one year earlier if they choose. The new standard allows for two methods of adoption: (a) full retrospective adoption, meaning the standard is applied to all periods presented or (b) modified retrospective adoption, meaning the cumulative effect of applying the new standard is recognized as an adjustment to the opening retained earnings balance. We do not intend to adopt the standard early and are in the process of determining the adoption method as well as the effects the adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements.Non-GAAP Financial InformationThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes references to free cash flow and return of capital to stockholders as a percentage of free cash flow. These are financial measures that were not prepared in accordance with GAAP. We define “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and “return of capital to stockholders” as cash paid to repurchase shares of our common stock and cash dividends paid.The non-GAAP financial information presented should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, “non-GAAP” is not a term defined by GAAP, and as a result, our measure of non-GAAP results might be different than similarly titled measures used by other companies. 44We use free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of the amount of cash flow generated that is available to grow our business and to create long-term stockholder value. We believe return of capital to stockholders as a percentage of free cash flow provides insight into our cash-generating activities relative to the amount of capital returned to stockholders. These non-GAAP measures are supplemental to the comparable GAAP measures. The following is a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP results for fiscal 2015 (dollars in millions): Net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP)$5,506Capital expenditures(994)Free cash flow (non-GAAP)$4,512 Cash paid to repurchase shares of our common stock (before commissions)$11,245Cash dividends paid2,880Total return of capital to stockholders14,125Less: common stock repurchases related to $10 billion stock repurchase commitment8,100Adjusted return of capital, excluding repurchases related to $10 billion stock repurchase commitment $6,025 Total return of capital to stockholders as a percentage of net cash provided by operating activities (GAAP)257%Total return of capital to stockholders as a percentage of free cash flow (non-GAAP)313%Adjusted return of capital to stockholders as a percentage of free cash flow (non-GAAP)134%Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskInterest Rate Risk - Debt and Interest Rate Swap Agreements. In fiscal 2015, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturity dates. We also entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion to effectively convert certain fixed-rate interest payments into floating-rate payments. The interest rates on our floating-rate notes and interest rate swaps are based on LIBOR. By issuing the floating-rate notes and entering into the interest rate swap agreements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. At September 27, 2015, a hypothetical increase in LIBOR-based interest rates of 100 basis points would cause our interest expense to increase by $30 million on an annualized basis as it relates to our floating-rate notes and the interest rate swap agreements.Additionally, in fiscal 2015, we began a commercial paper program that provides for the issuance of up to $4.0 billion of commercial paper. At September 27, 2015, we had $1.0 billion of commercial paper outstanding, with original maturities of less than 4 months. Changes in interest rates could affect the amounts of interest that we pay if we refinance the current outstanding commercial paper with new debt.Additional information regarding our notes and related interest rate swap agreements and commercial paper program is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6. Debt.”Interest Rate Risk - Investment Portfolio. We invest a portion of our cash in a number of diversified fixed and floating rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, debt funds and derivative instruments related to our investment portfolio (including interest rate swaps) that are subject to interest rate risk. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect the fair value of our investment portfolio. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise, our holdings could lose value. At September 27, 2015, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across the entire yield curve on our holdings would have resulted in decreases of $11 million and $323 million in the fair values of our holdings classified as trading (including derivative instruments) and our remaining holdings, respectively.Equity Price Risk. We hold a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equity securities and fund shares that are subject to equity price risk. We have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size, style, industry and geography, and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and fund shares at September 27, 2015 would have caused a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of $163 million. At September 27, 2015, gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and fund shares were $28 million. Although we consider the unrealized losses to be temporary, there is a risk that we may incur other-than-temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these securities if they do not recover in value within a reasonable period. 45Foreign Exchange Risk. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties. We utilize such derivative financial instruments for hedging or risk management purposes rather than for speculation purposes. Counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major banking institutions. In the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us, which could have a negative impact on our results. A description of our foreign currency accounting policies is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies.”At September 27, 2015, our net asset related to foreign currency option and forward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency risk (on royalties earned from certain licensees on their sales of CDMA-based devices) was negligible. If our forecasted royalty revenues for currencies in which we hedge were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in our hedged foreign currency, we would not incur a loss as our hedge positions would continue to be fully effective.At September 27, 2015, our net liability related to foreign currency option and forward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency risk (on certain operating expenditure transactions) was negligible. If our forecasted operating expenditures for currencies in which we hedge were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in our hedged foreign currency, we would incur a negligible loss.At September 27, 2015, our net asset related to foreign currency forwards, futures, options and swaps in our marketable securities portfolios that were not designated as hedging instruments was negligible. If the foreign exchange rates relevant to these contracts were to change unfavorably by 10% and we do not have an offset foreign currency exposure relating to debt instruments held in our marketable securities portfolios classified as trading, we would incur a negligible loss.Financial assets and liabilities held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global company, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies.Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks.",2023-12-30 18:21:41.911845
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2016,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Our Business and Operating Segments” under the heading “Seasonality.”Strategic Realignment PlanIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we announced a Strategic Realignment Plan designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth as we work to create sustainable long-term value for stockholders. As part of this Strategic Realignment Plan, among other actions, we implemented a cost reduction plan, which included a series of targeted reductions across our businesses, particularly in QCT, and a reduction to annual share-based compensation grants. Additional information regarding our Strategic Realignment Plan is provided in this Annual Report in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation, Fiscal 2016 Overview” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10. Strategic Realignment Plan.” 12AcquisitionsIn January 2016, we announced that we had reached an agreement with TDK Corporation to form a joint venture, under the name RF360 Holdings Singapore Pte. Ltd., to enable delivery of RFFE modules and RF filters into fully integrated products for mobile devices and IoT applications, among others. The joint venture will initially be owned 51% by us and 49% by TDK. Certain intellectual property, patents and filter and module design and manufacturing assets will be carved out of existing TDK businesses and be acquired by the joint venture, with certain assets acquired by us. The purchase price of our interest in the joint venture and the assets to be transferred to us is $1.2 billion, to be adjusted for working capital, outstanding indebtedness and certain capital expenditures, among other things. Additionally, we have the option to acquire (and TDK has an option to sell) TDK’s interest in the joint venture for $1.15 billion 30 months after the closing date. TDK will be entitled to up to a total of $200 million in payments based on sales of RF filter functions over the three-year period after the closing date, which is a substitute for and in lieu of any right of TDK to receive any profit sharing, distributions, dividends or other payments of any kind or nature. The transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and other closing conditions and is expected to close in early calendar 2017.On October 27, 2016, we announced a definitive agreement under which Qualcomm River Holdings, B.V., an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated, will acquire NXP Semiconductors N.V. Pursuant to the definitive agreement, Qualcomm River Holdings will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of NXP for $110 per share in cash, for estimated total cash consideration of $38 billion. NXP is a leader in high-performance, mixed-signal semiconductor electronics in automotive, broad-based microcontrollers, secure identification, network processing and RF power products. The transaction is expected to close by the end of calendar 2017 and is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions and other closing conditions, including the tender of specified percentages (which vary from 70% to 95% based on certain circumstances as provided in the definitive agreement) of the issued and outstanding common shares of NXP in the offer. An Extraordinary General Meeting of NXP’s shareholders will be convened in connection with the offer to adopt, among other things, certain resolutions relating to the transaction. The tender offer is not subject to any financing condition; however, we intend to fund the transaction with cash held by foreign entities and new debt. As a result, we secured $13.6 billion in committed financing in connection with signing the definitive agreement.Qualcomm River Holdings and NXP may terminate the definitive agreement under certain circumstances. If the definitive agreement is terminated by NXP in certain circumstances, including termination by NXP to enter into a superior proposal for an alternative acquisition transaction or a termination following a change of recommendation by the NXP board of directors, NXP will be required to pay Qualcomm River Holdings a termination fee of $1.25 billion. If the definitive agreement is terminated by Qualcomm River Holdings under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals or the failure of NXP to complete certain pre-closing reorganization steps in all material respects, Qualcomm River Holdings will be required to pay NXP a termination fee of $2.0 billion.Corporate StructureWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operations and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by QUALCOMM Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.Revenue Concentrations, Significant Customers and Geographical InformationConsolidated revenues from international customers and licensees as a percentage of total revenues were 98%, 99% and 99% in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. During fiscal 2016, 57%, 17% and 12% of our revenues were from customers and licensees based in China (including Hong Kong), South Korea and Taiwan, respectively, compared to 53%, 16% and 13% during fiscal 2015, respectively, and 50%, 23% and 11% during fiscal 2014, respectively. We report revenues from external customers by country based on the location to which our products or services are delivered, which for QCT is generally the country in which our customers manufacture their products, or for licensing revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees. As a result, the revenues by country presented herein are not necessarily indicative of either the country in which the devices containing our products and/or intellectual property are ultimately sold to consumers or the country in which the companies that sell the devices are headquartered. For example, China revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, 13which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States. Additional geographic information is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.”A small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, revenues from Samsung Electronics and from Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd./Foxconn, its affiliates and other suppliers to Apple Inc. each comprised more than 10% of consolidated revenues.Research and DevelopmentThe communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in CDMA, OFDMA and a broad range of other technologies. Using these engineering resources, we expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products and services, including continuing the development of CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies, developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world. Our research and development team has a demonstrated track record of innovation in voice and data communication technologies and application processor technology, among others. Our research and development expenditures in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 totaled approximately $5.2 billion, $5.5 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.We continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in 4G OFDMA-based technologies (including LTE) and 5G-based technologies. We also make acquisitions to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or to pursue new business opportunities.We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops), consumer electronics and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G and 4G LTE technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including WLAN, Bluetooth, Ethernet, GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other mobile client software environments in our chipsets.We develop on our own, and with our partners, innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition.We have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world that support our global development activities and ongoing efforts to develop and/or advance 4G OFDMA, 5G and a broad range of other technologies. We continue to use our substantial engineering resources and expertise to develop new technologies, applications and services and make them available to licensees to help grow the communications industry and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities.We also make investments in opportunities that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and enter into adjacent industry segments, such as products for automotive, the IoT, including the connected home, smart cities and wearables, data center, networking, mobile computing, mobile health and machine learning, including robotics, among others.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing activities of our operating segments are discussed under Operating Segments. Other marketing activities include public relations, advertising, digital marketing and social media, participation in technical conferences and trade shows, development of business cases and white papers, competitive analyses, industry intelligence and other marketing programs, such as marketing development funds with our customers. Our Corporate Marketing department provides company information on our Internet site and through other channels regarding our products, strategies and technology to industry analysts and media. 14CompetitionCompetition faced by our operating segments is discussed under Operating Segments. Competition in the communications industry throughout the world continues to increase at a rapid pace as consumers, businesses and governments realize the potential of wireless communications products and services. We have facilitated competition in the wireless communications industry by licensing our technologies to, and therefore enabling, a large number of manufacturers. Although we have attained a significant position in the industry, many of our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products, to use our competitors’ integrated circuit products, or to choose alternative technologies; lower cost structures and/or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices and lower or negative margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies or competitors; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and original equipment manufacturers in emerging geographic regions (such as China); and/or a more established presence in certain regions. These relationships may affect customers’ decisions to purchase products or license technology from us. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market positions to our detriment.We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings and introduce new technologies and services in the future and as additional companies compete with our products or services based on 3G, 4G or other technologies. Although we intend to continue to make substantial investments in developing new products and technologies and improving existing products and technologies, our competitors may introduce alternative products, services or technologies that threaten our business. It is also possible that the prices we charge for our products and services may continue to decline as competition continues to intensify.Corporate Responsibility and SustainabilityWe strive to better our local and global communities through ethical business practices, socially empowering technology applications, educational and environmental programs and employee diversity and volunteerism.•Our Governance.

Risk FactorsYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of these risks occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Risks Related to Our BusinessesOur proposed acquisition of NXP involves a number of risks, including, among others, the risk that we fail to complete the acquisition, in a timely manner or at all, regulatory risks, risks associated with our use of a significant portion of our cash and our taking on significant indebtedness, other financial risks, integration risks, and risk associated with the reactions of customers, suppliers and employees.Our and NXP’s obligations to consummate the proposed transaction are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among others: (i) the tender of a minimum number of NXP’s outstanding common shares in the tender offer to be commenced by a subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated; (ii) the expiration or termination of any waiting periods under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended; (iii) the receipt of regulatory clearance under European Union and certain other foreign antitrust laws; (iv) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the proposed transaction; (v) there being no event that would have a material adverse effect on NXP; (vi) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of NXP, subject to certain exceptions, and NXP’s material compliance with its covenants, in the definitive agreement; (vii) the approval of certain governance-related resolutions at an extraordinary general meeting of NXP’s shareholders; and (viii) the completion of certain internal reorganization steps with respect to NXP and the disposition of certain non-core assets of NXP. We cannot provide assurance that the conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all, and if the proposed transaction is not completed, we would not realize any of the expected benefits.The regulatory approvals required in connection with the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may contain materially burdensome conditions. If any conditions or changes to the structure of the proposed transaction are required to obtain these regulatory approvals, they may have the effect of jeopardizing or delaying completion of the proposed transaction or reducing our anticipated benefits. If we agree to any material conditions in order to obtain any approvals required to complete the proposed transaction, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. 17In addition, the use of a significant portion of our cash and the incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of the proposed transaction may have an adverse impact on our liquidity, limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions. See the Risk Factor entitled “There are risks associated with our indebtedness.”If the proposed transaction is not completed, our stock price could fall to the extent that our current price reflects an assumption that we will complete it. Furthermore, if the proposed transaction is not completed and the purchase agreement is terminated, we would not realize any of the expected benefits of the proposed transaction, and we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price, including, among others:•we could be required to pay a termination fee to NXP of $2.0 billion; •we will have incurred and may continue to incur costs relating to the proposed transaction, many of which are payable by us whether or not the proposed transaction is completed;•matters relating to the proposed transaction (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management team and numerous others throughout our organization, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities;•we may be subject to legal proceedings related to the proposed transaction or the failure to complete the proposed transaction;•the failure to consummate the proposed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative perception of us in the investment community; and•any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the proposed transaction, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, suppliers, partners or employees, may continue or intensify in the event the proposed transaction is not consummated. The proposed transaction will be our largest acquisition to date, by a significant margin. The benefits we expect to realize from the proposed transaction will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the businesses successfully and efficiently. See the Risk Factor entitled “We may engage in strategic acquisitions, transactions or make investments that could adversely affect our financial results or fail to enhance stockholder value.”Furthermore, uncertainties about the proposed transaction may cause our and/or NXP’s current and prospective employees to experience uncertainty about their futures. These uncertainties may impair our and/or NXP’s ability to retain, recruit or motivate key management, engineering, technical and other personnel. Similarly, our and/or NXP’s existing or prospective customers, licensees, suppliers and/or partners may delay, defer or cease purchasing products or services from or providing products or services to us or NXP; delay or defer other decisions concerning us or NXP; or otherwise seek to change the terms on which they do business with us or NXP. Any of the above could harm us and/or NXP, and thus decrease the benefits we expect to receive from the proposed transaction. The proposed transaction may also result in significant charges or other liabilities that could adversely affect our financial results, such as cash expenses and non-cash accounting charges incurred in connection with our acquisition and/or integration of the business and operations of NXP. Further, our failure to identify or accurately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities we are assuming in the proposed transaction could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting charges, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, operating results or financial condition. The price of our common stock following the proposed transaction could decline to the extent our financial results are materially affected by any of these events.Our revenues depend on commercial network deployments, expansions and upgrades of CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies; our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on these technologies; and customers’ demand for our products and services.We develop, patent and commercialize technology and products based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, which are primarily wireless. We depend on operators of wireless networks and our customers and licensees to adopt these technologies for use in their networks, devices and services. We also depend on our customers and licensees to develop devices and services based on these technologies with value-added features to drive consumer demand for new 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G devices, as well as establishing the selling prices for such devices. Further, we depend on the timing of our customers’ and licensees’ deployments of new devices and services based on these technologies. Increasingly, we also depend on operators of wireless networks, our customers and licensees and other third parties to incorporate these technologies into new device types and into industries beyond traditional cellular communications, such as automotive, the IoT, including the connected home, smart cities and wearables, data center, networking, mobile computing, mobile health and 18machine learning, including robotics, among others. We are also impacted by consumers’ rates of replacement of smartphones and other computing devices. Our revenues and/or growth in revenues could be negatively impacted, our business may be harmed and our substantial investments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return, if:•wireless operators and industries beyond traditional cellular communications deploy alternative technologies;•wireless operators delay 3G and 3G/4G multimode network deployments, expansions or upgrades and/or delay moving 2G customers to 3G, 3G/4G multimode or 4G wireless devices;•LTE, an OFDMA-based 4G wireless technology, is not more widely deployed or further commercial deployment is delayed;•government regulators delay making sufficient spectrum available for 3G, 4G, new unlicensed technologies that we are developing in conjunction with 3G and 4G, as well as for 5G, thereby restricting the ability of wireless operators to deploy or expand the use of these technologies;•wireless operators delay or do not drive improvements in 3G or 3G/4G multimode network performance and/or capacity;•our customers’ and licensees’ revenues and sales of products, particularly premium-tier products, and services using these technologies do not grow or do not grow as quickly as anticipated due to, for example, the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed regions;•our intellectual property and technical leadership included in the 5G standardization effort is different than in 3G and 4G standards;•the standardization and/or deployment of 5G technology is delayed; and/or•we are unable to drive the adoption of our products and services into networks and devices, including devices beyond traditional cellular applications, based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies.Our industry is subject to competition in an environment of rapid technological change that could result in decreased demand and/or declining average selling prices for our products and/or those of our customers and/or licensees.Our products, services and technologies face significant competition. We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to attract new business and/or customers, as new opportunities develop and as new competitors enter the industry. Competition in wireless communications is affected by various factors that include, among others: device manufacturer concentrations; growth in demand, consumption and competition in emerging geographic regions; government intervention and/or support of national industries and/or competitors; evolving industry standards and business models; evolving methods of transmission of voice and data communications; increasing data traffic and densification of wireless networks; convergence and aggregation of connectivity technologies (including Wi-Fi and LTE) in both devices and access points; consolidation of wireless technologies and infrastructure at the network edge; networking and connectivity trends (including cloud services); use of both licensed and unlicensed spectrum; the evolving nature of computing (including demand for always on, always connected capabilities); the speed of technological change (including the transition to smaller geometry process technologies); value-added features that drive selling prices as well as consumer demand for new 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G devices; turnkey, integrated products that incorporate hardware, software, user interface, applications and reference designs; scalability; and the ability of the system technology to meet customers’ immediate and future network requirements. We anticipate that additional competitors will introduce products as a result of growth opportunities in wireless communications, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, technological and public policy changes and relatively low barriers to entry in certain segments of the industry. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape.We expect that our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:•differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features (e.g., modem, RFFE, graphics and/or other processors, camera and connectivity) and with smaller geometry process technologies that drive performance;•develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points to effectively cover both emerging and developed geographic regions and all device tiers; 19•continue to drive the adoption of our integrated circuit products into the most popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices, such as smartphones, tablets, other computing devices, automobiles, wearable and other connected devices and infrastructure products;•maintain and/or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit products at the premium device tier, while increasing the adoption of our products in mid- and low-tier devices, in part by strengthening our integrated circuit product roadmap for, and developing channel relationships in, emerging geographic regions, such as China and India, and by providing turnkey products, which incorporate our integrated circuits, for low- and mid-tier smartphones and tablets;•continue to be a leader in 4G technology evolution, including expansion of our LTE-based single mode licensing program in areas where single-mode products are commercialized, and continue to innovate and introduce 4G turnkey, integrated products and services that differentiate us from our competition;•be a leader serving original equipment manufacturers, high level operating systems (HLOS) providers, operators and other industry participants as competitors, new industry entrants and other factors continue to affect the industry landscape;•be a preferred partner (and sustain preferred relationships) providing integrated circuit products that support multiple operating system and infrastructure platforms to industry participants that effectively commercialize new devices using these platforms;•increase and/or accelerate demand for our semiconductor component products, including RFFE, and our wired and wireless connectivity products, including networking products for consumers, carriers and enterprise equipment and connected devices;•identify potential acquisition targets that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic needs, reach agreement on terms acceptable to us and effectively integrate these new businesses and/or technologies;•create standalone value and/or contribute to the success of our existing businesses through acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions (and/or by developing customer, licensee and/or vendor relationships) in new industry segments and/or disruptive technologies, products and/or services (such as products for automotive, the IoT, including the connected home, smart cities and wearables, data center, networking, mobile computing, mobile health and machine learning, including robotics, among others); •become a leading supplier of radio frequency front-end products, which are designed to address cellular radio frequency band fragmentation while improving radio frequency performance and assist original equipment manufacturers in developing multiband, multimode mobile devices; •be a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing and develop and commercialize 5G integrated circuit products and services; and/or•continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in mobile computing and other consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging geographic regions.Competition in any or all product tiers may result in the loss of certain business or customers, which would negatively impact our revenues and operating results. Such competition may also reduce average selling prices for our chipset products and/or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging geographic regions where competitors may have lower cost structures and/or may have a willingness and ability to accept lower prices and/or lower or negative margins on their products (particularly in China). Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees’ products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.Companies that promote standards that are neither CDMA- nor OFDMA-based (e.g., GSM) as well as companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Broadcom Limited, Cirrus Logic, Ericsson, HiSilicon Technologies, Intel, Leadcore Technology Co., Ltd., Marvell Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, MediaTek, Microchip Technology Inc., Nvidia, Qorvo Inc., Realtek Semiconductor, Samsung Electronics, Skyworks Solutions Inc. and Spreadtrum Communications (which is controlled by Tsinghua Unigroup). Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products, to use our competitors’ integrated circuit products, or to choose alternative technologies; lower cost structures and/or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices 20and lower or negative margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies or competitors; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and original equipment manufacturers in emerging geographic regions (such as China); and/or a more established presence in certain regions.We derive a significant portion of our consolidated revenues from a small number of customers and licensees. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our operating results could be negatively affected.Our QCT segment derives a significant portion of its revenues from a small number of customers, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. In addition, certain of our largest integrated circuit customers develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past chosen, and may in the future choose, to utilize in certain of their devices rather than our integrated circuit products (and/or sell their integrated circuit products to third parties in competition with us). Also, one of our largest integrated circuit customers has begun to utilize products of one of our competitors in certain of their devices rather than our products. The loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by such customers or the cancelation of significant purchases from any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products, our competitors’ integrated circuit products or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected operating results, and a delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Further, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers’ new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing of such introductions may cause our operating results to fluctuate. Accordingly, if current industry dynamics and concentrations continue, our QCT segment’s revenues will continue to depend largely upon, and be impacted by, future purchases, and the timing and size of any such future purchases, by these significant customers.One of our largest customers purchases our Mobile Data Modem (MDM) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. To the extent such customer takes device share from our other customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted. Further, companies that develop HLOS for devices, including leading technology companies, now sell their own devices. If we fail to effectively partner or continue partnering with these companies, or with their partners or customers, they may decide not to purchase (either directly or through their contract manufacturers), or to reduce or discontinue their purchases of, our integrated circuit products.In addition, there has been and continues to be litigation among certain of our customers and other industry participants, and the potential outcomes of such litigation, including but not limited to injunctions against devices that incorporate our products and/or intellectual property or rulings on certain patent law or patent licensing issues that create new legal precedent, could impact our business, particularly if such action impacts one of our larger customers.Although we have more than 330 CDMA-based licensees, our QTL segment derives a significant portion of licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and/or payment requirements or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of such license agreements under similar terms, our revenues, operating results and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We have little or no control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our major licensees, without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.We derive a significant portion of our consolidated revenues from the premium-tier device segment. If sales of premium-tier devices decrease, and/or sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products decrease, our operating results could be negatively affected.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from the premium-tier device segment, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, slowing growth in the 21premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, lengthening replacement cycles in developed regions, where premium-tier smartphones are common; increasing consumer demand in emerging regions, particularly China, where premium-tier smartphones are less common and replacement cycles are on average longer than in developed regions; and/or a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and/or innovation cycles. In addition, as discussed in the prior risk factor, our industry is experiencing concentration of device share among a few companies at the premium tier, which gives them significant supply chain leverage. Further, those companies may utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products, or our competitors’ integrated circuit products, rather than our products in a portion of their devices. These dynamics may result in lower prices for and/or reduced sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products.A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, or a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), may reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected operating results. Efforts by some communications equipment manufacturers or their customers to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions and/or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.From time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to renegotiate, mitigate and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity and/or unenforceability of our patents and/or licenses, or some form of unfair competition; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and other organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the imposition of some form of compulsory licensing and/or to weaken a patent holder’s ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) licensees using various strategies to attempt to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers that results in lowering the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price on which the royalty is calculated. In addition, certain licensees have disputed or underreported royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or delayed entering into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and licensees and/or companies may continue to do so in the future. Further, to the extent such licensees and/or companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting and/or non-reporting on our business and operating results will be exacerbated.We are currently subject to various litigation and governmental investigations and/or proceedings, some of which may arise out of the strategies described above. Certain legal matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Depending on the type of matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region.In addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products (standard-essential patents) on terms that are fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these FRAND commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our patent portfolio.Further, some companies or entities have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents 22held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and/or have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by severely limiting the base upon which the royalty percentage may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (and/or other companies’) alleged failure to abide by these policies.Some SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted and may in the future adopt some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party.We expect that such proposals, interpretations and strategies will continue in the future, and if successful, our business model would be harmed, either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalties (or by reducing the royalties we can collect) on all or a portion of our patent portfolio, limiting our return on investment with respect to new technologies, limiting our ability to seek injunctions against infringers of our standard-essential patents, constraining our ability to make licensing commitments when submitting our technology for inclusion in future standards (which could make our technology less likely to be included in such standards) or forcing us to work outside of SDOs or other industry groups to promote our new technologies, and our results of operations could be negatively impacted. In addition, the legal and other costs associated with asserting or defending our positions have been and continue to be significant. We assume that such challenges, regardless of their merits, will continue into the foreseeable future and may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources.We are subject to government regulations and policies. Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or other proceedings, new or changed laws, regulations or policies and/or our failure or inability to comply with laws, regulations or policies.Our business, products and services, and those of our customers and licensees, are subject to various laws and regulations globally, as well as government policies and the specifications of international, national and regional communications standards bodies. The adoption of new laws, regulations or policies, changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations or policies, changes in the regulation of our activities by a government or standards body and/or adverse rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such laws, regulations or policies, including, among others, those affecting licensing practices, competitive business practices, the use of our technology or products, protection of intellectual property, trade, foreign investments or loans, spectrum availability and license issuance, adoption of standards, the provision of device subsidies by wireless operators to their customers, taxation, privacy and data protection, environmental protection or employment, could have an adverse effect on our business.We are currently subject to various governmental investigations and/or proceedings, and certain matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Depending on the type of matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region.Delays in government approvals or other governmental activities that could result from, among others, a decrease in or a lack of funding for certain agencies or branches of the government and/or political changes, could result in our incurring higher costs, could negatively impact our ability to timely consummate strategic transactions and/or could have other negative impacts on our business and the businesses of our customers and licensees.National, state and local environmental laws and regulations affect our operations around the world. These laws may make it more expensive to manufacture, have manufactured and sell products, and our costs could increase if our vendors (e.g., third-party manufacturers or utility companies) pass on their costs to us.Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) or an adjoining country, or were from recycled or scrap sources. The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to determine that our products are “DRC conflict free,” we may face challenges with our customers that place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed.Laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance, business conduct, public disclosure and health care are complex and changing and may create uncertainty regarding compliance. Laws, regulations and standards are subject to 23varying interpretations in many cases, and their application in practice may evolve over time. As a result, our efforts to comply may fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. New laws, regulations and standards or evolving interpretations of legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and/or procedures and may divert management time and attention to compliance activities.The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, or could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property rights or by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions.We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, international treaties and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and proprietary information is difficult and time consuming. The steps we have taken have not always prevented, and we cannot be certain the steps we will take in the future will prevent, the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary intellectual property rights as fully or as readily as United States laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective. Some industry participants who have a vested interest in devaluing patents in general, or standard-essential patents in particular, have mounted attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established patent laws. In the United States, there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law changes and current and potential future litigation regarding patents, the outcomes of which could be detrimental to our licensing business. The laws in certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including certain countries in Asia, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States. We expect that the European Union will adopt a unitary patent system in the next few years that may broadly impact that region’s patent regime. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any potential changes. In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of any standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in the future in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our products or technology.We have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights and/or contracts, including collecting royalties for use of our patent portfolio in particular foreign jurisdictions due to, among others: policies of foreign governments; challenges to our licensing practices under such jurisdictions’ competition laws; adoption of mandatory licensing provisions by foreign jurisdictions (either with controlled/regulated royalties or royalty free); failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce judgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and/or challenges pending before foreign competition agencies to the pricing and integration of additional features and functionality into our chipset products. Certain licensees have disputed or underreported royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or delayed entering into license agreements for their use of our intellectual property, and such licensees and/or companies may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, although our license agreements provide us with the right to audit the books and records of licensees, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. Further, certain licensees may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their books and records. To the extent we do not aggressively enforce our rights under our license agreements, licensees may not comply with their existing license agreements, and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed companies to enter into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, other unlicensed companies may not enter into license agreements.We have entered into litigation in the past and may need to further litigate in the future to enforce our contract and/or intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable (which may in turn result in other licensees either not complying with their existing license agreements and/or initiating litigation) and/or we could incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our operating results. Further, even a positive resolution to our enforcement efforts may take time to conclude, which may reduce our revenues in the period prior to conclusion.Our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our products and services into new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries, such as the IoT, automotive and computing, among others. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas and industry segments, and related technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing technologies, products 24and services and new technologies, such as 5G, may not generate operating income or contribute to future operating results that meet our expectations.Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, and we must make substantial research, development and other investments, such as acquisitions, in new products, services and technologies to compete successfully. Technological innovations generally require significant research and development efforts before they are commercially viable. While we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G OFDMA- and 5G-based technologies, we also innovate across a broad spectrum of opportunities to deploy new and expanded products and enter into adjacent industry segments by leveraging our existing technical and business expertise and/or through acquisitions.In particular, our future growth significantly depends on new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments, such as automotive, IoT, including the connected home, smart cities and wearables, data center, networking, mobile computing, mobile health and machine learning, including robotics, among others; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies, products and services for new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments; and third parties incorporating our technology, products and services into device types used in these product areas and industry segments. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments, and in developing new products, services and technologies for these product areas and industry segments.However, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments, and corresponding technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing, technologies, products and services and new technologies, such as use of both licensed and unlicensed spectrum, convergence of cellular and Wi-Fi and 5G, may not succeed due to, among others: new industry segments and/or consumer demand may not grow as anticipated; our strategies and/or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be successful; improvements in alternate technologies in ways that reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors’ products or services being more cost effective, having more capabilities or fewer limitations or being brought to market faster than our new products and services; and competitors having longer operating histories in industry segments that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of or overestimate the future operating income and/or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns. If our new technologies, products and/or services are not successful, or are not successful in the time frame we anticipate, we may incur significant costs and/or asset impairments, our business may not grow as anticipated, our revenues and/or margins may be negatively impacted and/or our reputation may be harmed.The continued and future success of our licensing programs can be impacted by the deployment of other technologies in place of technologies based on CDMA, OFDMA and their derivatives; the success of our licensing programs for 4G single mode products and emerging industry segments; and the need to extend license agreements that are expiring and/or to cover additional future patents.Although we own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to GSM, GPRS, EDGE, OFDM, OFDMA, WLAN and other technologies, our patent portfolio licensing program in these areas is less established and might not be as successful in generating licensing revenues as our CDMA licensing program has been. Many wireless operators are investigating, have selected or have deployed OFDMA-based LTE as their next-generation 4G technology in existing (or future if not yet deployed) wireless spectrum bands as complementary to their existing CDMA-based networks. While 3G/4G multimode products are generally covered by our existing 3G licensing agreements, products that implement 4G but do not also implement 3G are generally not covered by these agreements. Although we believe that our patented technology is essential and useful to implementation of the LTE industry standards and have granted royalty-bearing licenses to more than 210 companies (including Huawei, Lenovo, LG, Microsoft, Oppo, Samsung, Sony Mobile, vivo, Xiaomi and ZTE) that have realized that they need a license to our patents to make and sell products implementing 4G standards but not implementing 3G standards, it may be difficult to agree on material terms and/or conditions of new license agreements that are acceptable to us with companies that are currently unlicensed. Further, the royalty rates for single mode 4G products are lower than our royalty rates for 3G and 3G/4G multimode products, so, without a corresponding increase in volumes and/or device ASP, we will not achieve the same licensing revenues on such LTE products as on 3G and 3G/4G multimode products. In addition, new connectivity and other services are emerging that rely on devices that may or may not be used on traditional cellular networks, such as devices used in the connected home or the IoT. We also seek to diversify and broaden our technology licensing programs to new industry segments in which we can utilize our technology leadership, such as wireless charging and other technologies. Standards, even de facto standards, that develop as these technologies mature, in particular those that do not include a base level of interoperability, may impact our ability to obtain royalties that are equivalent to those that we receive for 3G and 3G/4G multimode products used in cellular communications. Although we believe that our patented 25technology is essential and useful to the commercialization of such services, the royalties we receive may be lower than those we receive from our current licensing program.Over the long-term, we need to continue to evolve our patent portfolio. If we do not maintain a strong portfolio that is applicable to current and/or future standards (such as 5G), products and/or services, our future licensing revenues could be negatively impacted.The licenses granted to and from us under a number of our license agreements include only patents that are either filed or issued prior to a certain date and, in a small number of agreements, royalties are payable on those patents for a specified time period. As a result, there are agreements with some licensees where later patents are not licensed by or to us and/or royalties are not owed to us under such license agreements after the specified time period. Additionally, certain of our license agreements (including essentially all of our recent agreements in China) are effective for a specified term. In order to license or to obtain a license to such later patents or after the expiration of a specified term, or to receive royalties after the specified time period, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. Accordingly, to the extent not renewed on their terms or by election for an additional (generally multi-year) period, if applicable, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees more frequently than we have done historically. We might not be able to renew those license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, in the future without affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees, and such modifications or new agreements may negatively impact our revenues. If there is a delay in renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize revenues related to that licensee’s product sales. Further, if we are unable to reach agreement on such modifications or new agreements, it could result in patent infringement litigation with such companies.We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture and testing of our products. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide technology leadership, supply assurance and low cost, our operating results and our business may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our operating results. Our QCT segment currently utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Under the turnkey model, our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party suppliers for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. The semiconductor manufacturing foundries that supply products to our QCT segment are primarily located in Asia, as are our primary warehouses where we store finished goods for fulfillment of customer orders. The following could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands and/or negatively impact our revenues, business operations, profitability and/or cash flows:•a reduction, interruption, delay or limitation in our product supply sources;•a failure by our suppliers to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our products;•our suppliers’ inability to react to shifts in product demand or an increase in raw material or component prices;•our suppliers’ delay in developing leading process technologies, or inability to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies;•the loss of a supplier or the inability of a supplier to meet performance, quality or yield specifications or delivery schedules; and/or•additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier.While we have established alternate suppliers for certain technologies, we rely on sole- or limited-source suppliers for certain products, subjecting us to significant risks, including: possible shortages of raw materials or manufacturing capacity; poor product performance; and reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing capability and yields, quality assurance, quantity and costs. To the extent we have established alternate suppliers, these suppliers may require significant levels of support to bring complex technologies to production. As a result, we may invest a significant amount of effort and resources and incur higher costs to support and maintain such alternate suppliers. Further, any future consolidation of foundry suppliers could increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and reduce our suppliers’ willingness to negotiate pricing, which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reductions and/or increase our manufacturing 26costs. Our arrangements with our suppliers may obligate us to incur costs to manufacture and test our products that do not decrease at the same rate as decreases in pricing to our customers. Our ability, and that of our suppliers, to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies, and to effectively compete with the manufacturing processes and performance of our competitors, could impact our ability to introduce new products and meet customer demand, could increase our costs (possibly decreasing our margins) and could subject us to the risk of excess inventories. Our inability to meet customer demand due to sole- or limited-sourcing and/or the additional costs that we incur because of these or other supply constraints or because of the need to support alternate suppliers could negatively impact our business and our results of operations.Although we have long-term contracts with our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific quantity, our suppliers may allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the production and testing of products for their other customers while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture or test our products. Accordingly, capacity for our products may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. To the extent we do obtain long-term capacity commitments, we may incur additional costs related to those commitments and/or make non-refundable payments for capacity commitments that are not used.One or more of our suppliers or potential alternate suppliers may manufacture CDMA- or OFDMA-based integrated circuits that compete with our products. In this event, the supplier could elect to allocate raw materials and manufacturing capacity to their own products and reduce or limit deliveries to us to our detriment. In addition, we may not receive reasonable pricing, manufacturing or delivery terms. We cannot guarantee that the actions of our suppliers will not cause disruptions in our operations that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers or increase our cost of sales.Additionally, we place orders with our suppliers using our forecasts of customer demand, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates, and are generally only partially covered by commitments from our customers. If we overestimate customer demand, we may experience increased excess and/or obsolete inventory, which would negatively impact our operating results. Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business.From time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights against our products or products using our technologies or other technologies used in our industry. These claims have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such litigation given, among other factors, the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products or services were found to infringe another company’s intellectual property rights, we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our products or services, which could be costly, or to license such rights and/or pay damages or other compensation to such other company. If we are unable to redesign our products or services, license such intellectual property rights used in our products or services or otherwise distribute our products (e.g., through a licensed supplier), we could be prohibited from making and selling such products or providing such services. In any potential dispute involving other companies’ patents or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers against certain types of liability and/or damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products or services sold or provided by us. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could hurt our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales and/or reductions in our licensees’ sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset and/or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delays, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.We expect that we may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (and/or on the sale of our customers’ devices using such products) and/or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our chipset customers 27and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our worldwide chipset sales and/or a reduction in our licensees’ sales to wireless operators, causing corresponding declines in our chipset and/or licensing revenues.Certain legal matters, including certain claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property, are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We may engage in strategic acquisitions, transactions or make investments that could adversely affect our financial results or fail to enhance stockholder value.We engage in strategic acquisitions and other transactions, including joint ventures, and make investments, which we believe are important to the future of our business, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. We acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology, wireless spectrum and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions and purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening new or expanding opportunities for our technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services) for voice and data communications and new industry segments. Recent material transactions include our acquisition of CSR plc, our pending joint venture with TDK Corporation and our proposed acquisition of NXP. Many of our strategic activities entail a high degree of risk and require the use of domestic and/or foreign capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies, products or services. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership interests. In addition, we may record impairment charges related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our financial results, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited. We may underestimate the costs and/or overestimate the benefits, including product and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve them. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions or other strategic activities, our results of operations may be adversely affected, and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transactions.Achieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions, including joint ventures and other strategic investments in which we have management and operational control, depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies. Such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, technology, products, processes, operations (including manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers and suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development and/or supply operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; and consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not derive any commercial value from associated technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these technologies, and we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain, or we may become subject to litigation. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sales or distribution channels, business or operational models (including manufacturing), geographic regions, industry segments and/or categories of products served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of the combination. Our use of open source software may harm our business.Certain of our software and our suppliers’ software may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, and we have seen, and believe we will continue to see, an increase in customers requesting that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage. Also, our use and our customers’ use of open source software may subject our products and our customers’ products to governmental scrutiny and delays in product certification, which could cause customers to view our products as less desirable than our competitors’ products. 28While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property rights, our use of open source software presents risks that could have an adverse effect on these rights and on our business.Our stock price, earnings and the fair value of our investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market downturns.Our stock price and earnings have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock and/or earnings include those identified throughout this Risk Factors section, volatility of the stock market in general and technology-based companies in particular, announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers or licensees and variations between our actual results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts, among others. Further, increased volatility in the financial markets and/or overall economic conditions may reduce the amounts that we realize in the future on our cash equivalents and/or marketable securities and may reduce our earnings as a result of any impairment charges that we record to reduce recorded values of marketable securities to their fair values.In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Due to changes in our stock price, we are and may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s attention and our resources. Certain legal matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”We maintain an extensive investment portfolio of varied holdings, which are generally classified as available-for-sale and are therefore recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair value of our investments are subject to fluctuation based primarily on market price volatility, as well as the underlying operations of the associated investment, among other things. If the fair value of such investments decreases below their cost basis, as some of our previous investments have, we may be required in certain circumstances to recognize a loss in our results of operations. The sensitivity of and risks associated with the market value of our investment portfolio are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” There are risks associated with our indebtedness.Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur, including in connection with our proposed acquisition of NXP, may have negative consequences on our business, including, among others:•requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends or other general corporate and other purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and/or•increasing our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations to the extent a portion of our debt has variable interest rates.Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things: repatriate funds to the United States at substantial tax cost; refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing and/or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such refinancing and/or restructuring would increase. If there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt in the future and/or the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.Global, regional or local economic conditions that impact the mobile communications industry or the other industries in which we operate could negatively affect the demand for our products and services and our customers’ or licensees’ products and services, which may negatively affect our revenues.A decline in global, regional or local economic conditions or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or 29licensees, could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on demand for our products and for the products and services of our customers or licensees, particularly equipment manufacturers or others in the wireless communications industry who buy their products, such as wireless operators. Any prolonged economic downturn may result in a decrease in demand for our products or technologies; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting and/or payments from our licensees and/or customers; failures by counterparties; and negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers’ ability to purchase or pay for our products and services and network operators’ ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be adversely affected by economic conditions, leading to a reduction, cancelation or delay of orders for our products or services.We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them, particularly in an environment of cost reductions. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenues, harm our ability to collect receivables or increase the U.S. dollar cost of our products.Our customers sell their products throughout the world in various currencies. Our consolidated revenues from international customers as a percentage of our total revenues were greater than 90% during each of the last three fiscal years. Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business and our operating results due to a number of factors, including, among others:•Our products and those of our customers and licensees that are sold outside the United States may become less price-competitive, which may result in reduced demand for those products and/or downward pressure on average selling prices;•Certain of our revenues, such as royalties, that are derived from licensee or customer sales denominated in foreign currencies could decrease;•Our foreign suppliers may raise their prices if they are impacted by currency fluctuations, resulting in higher than expected costs and lower margins; and/or•Foreign exchange hedging transactions that we engage in to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations may require the payment of structuring fees, limit the U.S. dollar value of royalties from licensees’ sales that are denominated in foreign currencies, cause earnings volatility if the hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting and expose us to counterparty risk if the counterparty fails to perform.Failures in our products or services or in the products or services of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.The use of devices containing our products to access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system software in those devices to viral or malicious attacks. While we continue to focus on this issue and are taking measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities continue to evolve, enabling more data and processes, such as mobile computing, and increasing the risk of security failures. Further, our products are inherently complex and may contain defects or errors that are detected only when the products are in use. The design process interface in new domains of technology and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes are complex and add risk to manufacturing yields and reliability. Further, manufacturing, testing, marketing and use of our products and those of our customers and licensees entail the risk of product liability. Because our products and services are responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products and/or networks, security failures, defects or errors in our products or services could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and/or on the end users of our customers’ products. Such adverse impact could include product liability claims or recalls, write-offs of our inventories and/or intangible assets; unfavorable purchase commitments; a shift of business to our competitors; a decrease in demand for connected devices and wireless services; damage to our reputation and to our customer relationships; and other financial liability or harm to our business. Further, security failures, defects or errors in the products of our customers or licensees, such as the recent issues with the Galaxy Note 7 that caused Samsung to discontinue that product, could have an adverse impact on our operating results due to a delay or decrease in demand for our products or services generally, and our premium-tier products in particular, among other factors. 30Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches.Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are increasingly more sophisticated. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks and impersonating authorized users, among others. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. While we have identified several incidents of unauthorized access, to date none have caused material damage to our business. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives and/or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ confidential information, we may incur liability. We expect to continue to devote resources to the security of our information technology systems.Potential tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Singapore where our QCT segment’s non-United States headquarters is located. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In such case, our income tax provision and results of operations in the period or periods in which that determination is made could be negatively affected.We have tax incentives in Singapore provided that we meet specified employment and other criteria, and as a result of the expiration of these incentives, our Singapore tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal 2017 and again in fiscal 2027. If we do not meet the criteria required to retain such incentives, our Singapore tax rate could increase prior to fiscal 2027, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.Tax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. For example, we consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States based on our current needs for those earnings to be reinvested offshore as well as estimates that future domestic cash generated from operations and/or borrowings will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs for the foreseeable future. No provision has been made for United States federal, state or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries. Our future financial results and liquidity may be adversely affected if tax rules regarding unrepatriated earnings change, if domestic cash needs require us to repatriate foreign earnings, if the shares of these foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred or if the United States international tax rules change as part of comprehensive tax reform or other tax legislation. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to transfer pricing. These changes, if adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. We have not yet determined what changes, if any, may be needed to our operations or structure to address BEPS. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the United States or Singapore, our operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition could be adversely affected.Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2. PropertiesAt September 25, 2016, we occupied the following facilities (square footage in millions): United States Other Countries TotalOwned facilities4.6 0.1 4.7Leased facilities1.6 3.3 4.9Total6.2 3.4 9.6 31Our headquarters as well as certain research and development, manufacturing and network management hub operations are located in San Diego, California. Additionally, our QCT segment’s non-United States headquarters is located in Singapore. We also own and lease properties around the world for use as sales and administrative offices and research and development centers, primarily in the United States, India, China and the United Kingdom. Our facility leases expire at varying dates through 2025, not including renewals that would be at our option. Several other owned and leased facilities are under construction totaling approximately 493,000 additional square feet.We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and that the productive capacity in facilities that are not under construction is substantially utilized. We do not identify or allocate facilities by operating segment. Additional information on net property, plant and equipment by geography is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.” In the future, we may need to purchase, build or lease additional facilities to meet the requirements projected in our long-term business plan.Item 3. Legal ProceedingsInformation regarding legal proceedings is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We are also engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business and, while there can be no assurance, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Item 4. Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable. 32Part IIItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket Information and DividendsOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “QCOM.” The following table sets forth the range of high and low sales prices of our common stock, as reported by NASDAQ, and cash dividends announced per share of common stock for the fiscal periods presented.

On October 31, 2016, the last sale price reported on the NASDAQ Global Select Market for our common stock was $68.72 per share. On October 6, 2016, we announced a cash dividend of $0.53 per share on our common stock, payable on December 16, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 30, 2016. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements, including those relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, legal risks, stock repurchase programs, debt issuance, changes in federal and state income tax law and changes to our business model.Share-Based CompensationWe primarily issue restricted stock units under our equity compensation plans, which are part of a broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and directors and align stockholder and employee interests.Our 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2016 Plan) provides for the grant of both incentive and nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, unrestricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, performance shares, deferred compensation awards and other stock-based awards.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIn addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in the section entitled “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report.OverviewFiscal 2016 OverviewThe transition of wireless networks and devices to 3G/4G (CDMA-based, OFDMA-based and CDMA/OFDMA multimode) continued around the world. 3G/4G connections increased to approximately 4.0 billion, up 18% year-over-year, and represent approximately 54% of total mobile connections, up from 47% at the end of fiscal 2015.(1) Revenues were $23.6 billion, a decrease of 7% compared to fiscal 2015, with net income attributable to Qualcomm of $5.7 billion, an increase of 8% compared to fiscal 2015.QCT Segment. We shipped approximately 842 million Mobile Station Modem (MSM) integrated circuits for CDMA- and OFDMA-based wireless devices, a decrease of 10%, compared to approximately 932 million MSM integrated circuits in fiscal 2015. QCT’s revenues decreased by 10%, and its earnings before taxes as a percentage of revenues decreased to 12% from 14% in fiscal 2015, primarily due to the effects of a shift in share among our customers within the premium tier, which reduced our sales of integrated Snapdragon processors and skewed our product mix towards lower-margin modem chipsets in this tier, a decline in share at our large customers and the competitive environment in China, partially offset by lower product costs, including lower excess inventory charges, and the impact of the acquisition of CSR in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.QTL Segment. Total reported device sales(2) by licensees were approximately $267.4 billion in fiscal 2016, an increase of approximately 7%, compared to approximately $250.9 billion in fiscal 2015. However, despite the increase in total reported device sales, QTL’s revenues decreased by 4% compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to decreases in revenues per reported unit and recognition of unearned license fees, partially offset by an increase in reported sales of CDMA-based products (including multimode products that also implement OFDMA) and $266 million in licensing revenues recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 due to the termination of an infrastructure license agreement resulting from the merger of two licensees. QTL revenues and EBT in fiscal 2016 continued to be impacted negatively by units that we believe are not being reported by certain licensees and sales of certain unlicensed products.Strategic Realignment Plan. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we announced a Strategic Realignment Plan designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth as we work to create sustainable long-term value for stockholders. As part of this Strategic Realignment Plan, among other actions, we implemented a cost reduction plan, which included a series of targeted reductions across our businesses, particularly in QCT, and a reduction to annual share-based compensation grants. These cost reduction initiatives were achieved by the end of fiscal 2016.(3) During fiscal 2016, we recorded restructuring and restructuring-related charges of $202 million related to the plan.Capital Return Program. We previously announced our intention to repurchase $10 billion of stock from March 2015 through March 2016. In the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we completed the remaining $1.9 billion of repurchases towards our $10 billion stock repurchase commitment, which includes the completion of our $5.0 billion accelerated share repurchase agreements. Excluding these stock repurchases, we returned $5.0 billion to stockholders, including $2.0 billion through repurchases of common stock and $3.0 billion of cash dividends. Shares outstanding decreased by 3% to 1.48 billion at September 25, 2016 from 1.52 billion at September 27, 2015 due to share repurchases, partially offset by net shares issued under our employee benefit plans. (1)According to GSMA Intelligence estimates as of October 31, 2016 for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 (estimates excluded Wireless Local Loop).(2)Total reported device sales is the sum of all reported sales in U.S. dollars (as reported to us by our licensees) of all licensed CDMA-based, OFDMA-based and CDMA/OFDMA multimode subscriber devices (including handsets, modules, modem cards and other subscriber devices) by our licensees during a particular period (collectively, 3G/4G devices). Not all licensees report sales the same way (e.g., some licensees report sales net of permitted deductions, including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items, while other licensees report sales and then identify the amount of permitted deductions in their reports), and the way in which licensees report such information may change from time to time. In addition, certain licensees may not report (in the quarter in which they are contractually obligated to report) their sales of certain types of subscriber units, which (as a result of audits, legal actions or for other 36reasons) may be reported in a subsequent quarter. Accordingly, total reported device sales for a particular period may include prior period activity that was not reported by the licensee until such particular period.(3)The cost reduction initiative related to certain research and development and selling, general and marketing expenses and certain non-product-related cost of revenues. It excludes the impact of the CSR and Capsule Technologie acquisitions as well as costs of a nonreportable segment up to the amount of related revenues recognized in fiscal 2016.Our Business and Operating SegmentsWe design, manufacture, have manufactured on our behalf and market digital communications products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing our intellectual property, including patents, software and other rights. We have three reportable segments. We conduct business primarily through two reportable segments, QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing), and our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. Our reportable segments are operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated and its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.QCT is a leading developer and supplier of integrated circuits and system software based on CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies for use in wireless voice and data communications, networking, application processing, multimedia and global positioning system products. QCT’s integrated circuit products are sold and its system software is licensed to manufacturers that use our products in mobile phones, tablets, laptops, data modules, handheld wireless computers and gaming devices, access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment, broadband gateway equipment and other consumer electronic devices. Our MSM integrated circuits, which include the Mobile Data Modem, Qualcomm Single Chip and Snapdragon processors and LTE modems, perform the core baseband modem functionality in wireless devices providing voice and data communications, as well as multimedia applications and global positioning functions. In addition, our Snapdragon processors provide advanced application and graphics processing capabilities. QCT’s system software helps enable the other device components to interface with the integrated circuit products and is the foundation software enabling manufacturers to develop devices utilizing the functionality within the integrated circuits. QCT revenues comprised 65%, 68% and 70% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.QCT currently utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Integrated circuits are die cut from silicon wafers that have completed the package assembly and test manufacturing processes. We rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits based primarily on our proprietary designs and test programs. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Turnkey is when our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party suppliers for manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test.QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products, including, without limitation, products implementing CDMA2000, WCDMA, CDMA TDD and/or LTE standards and their derivatives. QTL licensing revenues include license fees and royalties based on sales by licensees of products incorporating or using our intellectual property. License fees are fixed amounts paid in one or more installments. Royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items). QTL recognizes royalty revenues based on royalties reported by licensees and when other revenue recognition criteria are met. Licensees, however, do not report and pay royalties owed for sales in any given quarter until after the conclusion of that quarter. QTL revenues comprised 33%, 31% and 29% of our total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The vast majority of such revenues were generated through our licensees’ sales of CDMA2000- and WCDMA-based products, such as feature phones and smartphones.QSI makes strategic investments that are focused on opening new or expanding opportunities for our technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services) for voice and data communications. Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries, including, but not limited to, digital media, e-commerce, healthcare and wearable devices. Investments primarily include non- 37marketable equity instruments, which generally are recorded using the cost method or the equity method, and convertible debt instruments, which are recorded at fair value. QSI also held wireless spectrum, which was sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 for a gain of approximately $380 million. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with development contracts with one of our equity method investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future. Nonreportable segments include our mobile heath, data center, small cell and other wireless technology and service initiatives.Seasonality. Many of our products or intellectual property are incorporated into consumer wireless devices, which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand. As a result, QCT has tended historically to have stronger sales toward the end of the calendar year as manufacturers prepare for major holiday selling seasons; and because QTL recognizes royalty revenues when royalties are reported by licensees, QTL has tended to record higher royalty revenues in the first calendar quarter when licensees report their sales made during the fourth calendar quarter. We have also experienced fluctuations in revenues due to the timing of conversions and expansions of 3G and 3G/4G networks by wireless operators and the timing of launches of flagship wireless devices that incorporate our products and/or intellectual property. These trends may or may not continue in the future. Looking ForwardWe expect continued growth in the coming years in consumer demand for 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G products and services around the world, driven primarily by smartphones. We also expect growth in new device categories and industries, driven by the expanding adoption of certain technologies that are already commonly used in smartphones. As we look forward to the next several months, we expect our business to be impacted by the following key items:•On October 27, 2016, we announced a definitive agreement under which Qualcomm River Holdings, B.V., an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary of Qualcomm Incorporated, will acquire NXP Semiconductors N.V. Pursuant to the definitive agreement, Qualcomm River Holdings will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of NXP for $110 per share in cash, for estimated total cash consideration of $38 billion. NXP is a leader in high-performance, mixed-signal semiconductor electronics in automotive, broad-based microcontrollers, secure identification, network processing and RF power products. The transaction is expected to close by the end of calendar 2017 and is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions and other closing conditions, including the tender of specified percentages (which vary from 70% to 95% based on certain circumstances as provided in the definitive agreement) of the issued and outstanding common shares of NXP in the offer. The tender offer is not subject to any financing condition; however, we intend to fund the transaction with cash held by foreign entities and new debt. We expect that this will require us to: devote significant resources and management time and attention prior to close; take on significant debt; and utilize a substantial portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities.•Consumer demand for 3G/4G smartphone products is increasing in emerging regions, particularly in China, driven by availability of lower-tier-3G/4G devices. We expect the ongoing rollout of 4G services in emerging regions will encourage competition and growth, bringing the benefits of 3G/4G LTE multimode to consumers. •Our business, particularly QCT, expects to continue to be impacted by industry dynamics, including:•Concentration of device share among a few companies within the premium tier, resulting in significant supply chain leverage for those companies; •Decisions by companies to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products or our competitors’ integrated circuit products in a portion of their devices; •Intense competition, particularly in China, as our competitors expand their product offerings and/or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to attract new and/or retain customers; and•Lengthening replacement cycles in developed regions, where the smartphone industry is mature, premium-tier smartphones are common and consumer demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and/or innovation cycles, and from increasing consumer demand in emerging regions where premium-tier smartphones are less common and replacement cycles are on average longer than in developed regions.•We continue to believe that certain licensees, particularly in China, are not fully complying with their contractual obligations to report their sales of licensed products to us, and certain companies, including unlicensed companies, are delaying execution of new license agreements. While we have made substantial progress in reaching agreements 38with many companies, negotiations with certain licensees and unlicensed companies are ongoing. We believe that the conclusion of new agreements with these companies will result in improved reporting by these licensees, including with respect to sales of three-mode devices (i.e., devices that implement GSM, TD-SCDMA and LTE-TDD) sold in China. Additionally, we believe our increased efforts in the areas of compliance will also improve reporting, but will also result in increased costs to the business. Litigation and/or other actions (such as the litigation against Meizu Technology Co., Ltd. described in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies”) may be necessary to compel licensees to report and pay the required royalties for sales they have not previously reported and/or to compel unlicensed companies to execute licenses.•Regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions continue to investigate our business practices. An unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business with remedies that include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies” elsewhere in this Annual Report.•We continue to invest significant resources toward advancements in 4G LTE and 5G technologies, OFDM-based WLAN technologies, wireless baseband chips, our converged computing/communications (Snapdragon) chips, radio frequency front-end (RFFE), connectivity, graphics, audio and video codecs, multimedia products, software and services, which contribute to the expansion of our intellectual property portfolio. We are also investing in targeted opportunities that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new business models and enter into new industry segments, such as products for automotive, the Internet of Things (IoT), including the connected home, smart cities and wearables, data center, networking, mobile computing, mobile health and machine learning, including robotics, among others.•In January 2016, we announced that we had reached an agreement with TDK Corporation to form a joint venture, under the name RF360 Holdings Singapore Pte. Ltd., to enable delivery of RFFE modules and RF filters into fully integrated products for mobile devices and IoT applications, among others. The joint venture will initially be owned 51% by us and 49% by TDK. Certain intellectual property, patents and filter and module design and manufacturing assets will be carved out of existing TDK businesses and be acquired by the joint venture, with certain assets acquired by us. The purchase price of our interest in the joint venture and the assets to be transferred to us is $1.2 billion, to be adjusted for working capital, outstanding indebtedness and certain capital expenditures, among other things. Additionally, we have the option to acquire (and TDK has an option to sell) TDK’s interest in the joint venture for $1.15 billion 30 months after the closing date. TDK will be entitled to up to a total of $200 million in payments based on sales of RF filter functions over the three-year period after the closing date, which is a substitute for and in lieu of any right of TDK to receive any profit sharing, distributions, dividends or other payments of any kind or nature. The transaction is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals and other closing conditions and is expected to close in early calendar 2017.In addition to the foregoing business and market-based matters, we continue to devote resources to working with and educating participants in the wireless value chain and governments as to the benefits of our business model and our extensive technology investments in promoting a highly competitive and innovative wireless industry. However, we expect that certain companies may continue to be dissatisfied with the need to pay reasonable royalties for the use of our technology and not welcome the success of our business model in enabling new, highly cost-effective competitors to their products. We expect that such companies, and/or governments or regulators, will continue to challenge our business model in various forums throughout the world. Further discussion of risks related to our business is presented in the Risk Factors included in this Annual Report. Critical Accounting EstimatesThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, including assumptions as to future events. By their nature, estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Although we believe that our estimates and the assumptions supporting our assessments are reasonable, actual results that differ from our estimates could be material to our consolidated financial statements. A summary of our significant accounting policies is included in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies.” We consider the following accounting estimates to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 39Impairment of Marketable Securities and Other Investments. We hold investments in marketable securities, with increases and decreases in fair value generally recorded through stockholders’ equity as other comprehensive income or loss. We record impairment losses in earnings when we believe an investment has experienced a decline that is other than temporary. The determination that a decline is other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors. Adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of investees could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments, thereby requiring recognition of impairment losses. When assessing these investments for an other-than-temporary decline in value, we consider such factors as, among other things, the significance of the decline in value as compared to the cost basis; underlying factors contributing to a decline in the prices of securities in a single asset class; how long the market value of the security has been less than its cost basis; the security’s relative performance versus its peers, sector or asset class; expected market volatility; the market and economy in general; analyst recommendations and price targets; views of external investment managers; news or financial information that has been released specific to the investee; and the outlook for the overall industry in which the investee operates, as applicable. During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $112 million, $163 million and $156 million, respectively, in impairment losses on our investments in marketable securities. As of September 25, 2016, we had gross unrealized losses of $105 million. Prior to closing the NXP transaction, we expect to divest a substantial portion of our marketable securities portfolio in order to finance our proposed acquisition, which may result in losses in our results of operations.We also hold investments in non-marketable equity instruments in privately held companies that are accounted for using either the cost or the equity method. Many of these investments are in early-stage companies, which are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products of these companies are uncertain and may never develop. We monitor our investments for events or circumstances that could indicate the investments are impaired, such as a deterioration in the investee’s financial condition and business forecasts and lower valuations in recently completed or proposed financings, and we record impairment losses in earnings when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary.Valuation of Inventories. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market (replacement cost, not to exceed net realizable value) using the first-in, first-out method. Recoverability of inventories is assessed based on review of future customer demand that considers multiple factors, including committed purchase orders from customers as well as purchase commitment projections provided by customers, among other things. This valuation also requires us to make judgments and assumptions based on information currently available about market conditions, including competition, product pricing, product life cycle and development plans. If we overestimate demand for our products, the amount of our loss will be impacted by our contractual ability to reduce inventory purchases from our suppliers. Our assumptions of future product demand are inherently uncertain, and changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material write-downs in the future. Valuation of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived and Long-Lived Assets. Our business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. We also acquire intangible assets and property, plant and equipment in other types of transactions. The determination of the recorded value of intangible assets acquired in a business combination requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements. For intangible assets acquired in a non-monetary exchange, the estimated fair values of the assets transferred (or the estimated fair values of the assets received, if more clearly evident) are used to establish their recorded values, unless the values of neither the assets received nor the assets transferred are determinable within reasonable limits, in which case the assets received are measured based on the carrying values of the assets transferred. Valuation techniques consistent with the market approach, income approach and/or cost approach are used to measure fair value. An estimate of fair value can be affected by many assumptions that require significant judgment. For example, the income approach generally requires us to use assumptions to estimate future cash flows including those related to total addressable market, pricing and share forecasts, competition, technology obsolescence, future tax rates and discount rates. Our estimate of the fair value of certain assets may differ materially from that determined by others who use different assumptions or utilize different business models. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amounts may be impaired. Long-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets may be based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions, expected selling price and/or other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning, when appropriate. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on a 40portion or all of our goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and/or long-lived assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values. Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses are impaired. Any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations. During fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded $107 million, $317 million and $642 million, respectively, in impairment charges for goodwill, other indefinite-lived intangible assets and long-lived assets. The estimated fair values of our QCT and QTL reporting units were substantially in excess of their respective carrying values at September 25, 2016. Legal Proceedings. We are currently involved in certain legal proceedings, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves. However, the unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. A broad range of remedies with respect to our business practices that are deemed to violate applicable laws are potentially available. These remedies may include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or to modify our business practices. We disclose a loss contingency if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a material loss has been incurred. We record our best estimate of a loss related to pending legal proceedings when the loss is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Where a range of loss can be reasonably estimated with no best estimate in the range, we record the minimum estimated liability. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability, including the probability of loss related to pending legal proceedings, and revise our estimates and update our disclosures accordingly. Significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether a loss is reasonably estimable. Revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations. Income Taxes. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and the assessment of our income tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in various taxing jurisdictions. In addition, the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. Tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy, changes in legislation, the evolution of regulations and court rulings. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining our provision for income taxes, including those related to tax incentives, intercompany research and development cost-sharing arrangements, transfer pricing and tax credits. While we believe we have appropriate support for the positions taken on our tax returns, we regularly assess the potential outcomes of examinations by taxing authorities in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. Therefore, the actual liability for United States or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates, which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities. We are participating in the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Compliance Assurance Process program whereby we endeavor to agree with the IRS on the treatment of all issues prior to filing our federal return. A benefit of participation in this program is that post-filing adjustments by the IRS are less likely to occur.Our QCT segment’s non-United States headquarters is located in Singapore. We obtained tax incentives in Singapore that commenced in March 2012, including a tax exemption for the first five years, provided that we meet specified employment and incentive criteria, and as a result of the expiration of these incentives, our Singapore tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal 2017 and again in fiscal 2027. Our failure to meet these criteria could adversely impact our provision for income taxes.We consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States based on our plans for use and/or investment outside of the United States and our belief that our sources of cash and liquidity in the United States will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs. On a regular basis, we consider projected cash needs for, among other things, potential acquisitions, such as our proposed acquisition of NXP, investments in our existing businesses, future research and development and capital transactions, including repurchases of our common stock, dividends and debt repayments. We estimate the amount of cash or other liquidity that is available or needed in the jurisdictions where these investments are expected as well as our ability to generate cash in those jurisdictions and our access to capital markets. This analysis enables us to conclude whether or not we will indefinitely reinvest the current period’s foreign earnings. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability of approximately $11.5 billion related to the United States federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes on approximately $32.5 billion of undistributed earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries indefinitely reinvested outside the United States. Should we decide to no longer indefinitely reinvest such earnings outside the United States, for example, if we determine that such earnings are needed to fund future domestic operations or there is not a sufficient need for such earnings outside of the United States, we would have to adjust the income tax provision in the period we make such determination. 41Results of OperationsRevenues (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 Change 2015 vs. 2014 ChangeEquipment and services$15,467 $17,079 $18,625 $(1,612) $(1,546)Licensing8,087 8,202 7,862 (115) 340 $23,554 $25,281 $26,487 $(1,727) $(1,206)The decreases in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2016 and 2015 were primarily due to decreases in QCT revenues of $1.76 billion and $1.49 billion, respectively. The decrease in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2016 was partially offset by increases in a nonreportable segment’s revenues and QSI revenues of $56 million and $43 million, respectively. The decrease in licensing revenues in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the decrease in QTL revenues, partially offset by an increase in a nonreportable segment’s revenues of $143 million. The increase in our licensing revenues in fiscal 2015 was primarily due to an increase in QTL revenues of $378 million. QCT and QTL segment revenues related to the products of Samsung Electronics and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd/Foxconn, its affiliates and other suppliers to Apple Inc. comprised 40%, 45% and 49% of total consolidated revenues in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.Revenues from customers in China, South Korea and Taiwan comprised 57%, 17% and 12%, respectively, of total consolidated revenues for fiscal 2016, compared to 53%, 16% and 13%, respectively, for fiscal 2015, and 50%, 23% and 11%, respectively, for fiscal 2014. We report revenues from external customers by country based on the location to which our products or services are delivered, which for QCT is generally the country in which our customers manufacture their products, or for licensing revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees. As a result, the revenues by country presented herein are not necessarily indicative of either the country in which the devices containing our products and/or intellectual property are ultimately sold to consumers or the country in which the companies that sell the devices are headquartered. For example, China revenues would include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States.Costs and Expenses (in millions) 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 Change 2015 vs. 2014 ChangeCost of revenues$9,749 $10,378 $10,686 $(629) $(308)Gross margin 59% 59% 60% The margin percentage in fiscal 2016 remained flat primarily due to the effect of $163 million in additional charges related to the amortization of intangible assets and the recognition of the step-up of inventories to fair value primarily related to the acquisition of CSR plc in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, offset by the impact of higher-margin segment mix primarily related to QTL. The decrease in margin percentage in fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to a decrease in QCT gross margin percentage. Our margin percentage may continue to fluctuate in future periods depending on the mix of products sold and services provided, competitive pricing, new product introduction costs and other factors. 2016 2015 2014 2016 vs. 2015 Change 2015 vs. 2014 ChangeResearch and development$5,151 $5,490 $5,477 $(339) $13% of revenues22% 22% 21% Selling, general, and administrative$2,385 $2,344 $2,290 $41 $54% of revenues10% 9% 9% Other$(226) $1,293 $484 $(1,519) $809The dollar decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to a decrease of $228 million in costs related to the development of integrated circuit technologies and related software products. Such decrease was primarily driven by actions initiated under the Strategic Realignment Plan, partially offset by increased research and development costs resulting from acquisitions. The decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal 2016 also 42included decreases of $67 million in development costs of display technologies and $45 million in share-based compensation expense. The dollar increase in research and development expenses in fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to an increase of $117 million in costs related to the development of integrated circuit technologies and related software products, partially offset by a decrease of $72 million related to the development costs of display technologies and additional decreases related to the development costs of other new product and licensing initiatives.The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to increases of $65 million in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, $39 million in employee-related expenses and $27 million in depreciation and amortization expense, partially offset by decreases of $36 million in share-based compensation expense, $21 million in selling and marketing expenses, $19 million in professional services and $17 million in patent-related costs. The dollar increase in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2015 was primarily attributable to increases of $73 million in selling and marketing expenses and $46 million in costs related to litigation and other legal matters, partially offset by decreases of $49 million in employee-related expenses and $13 million in share-based compensation.Other income in fiscal 2016 was primarily attributable to a $380 million gain on the sale of wireless spectrum, partially offset by be net charges related to our Strategic Realignment Plan, which included $202 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges, partially offset by a $48 million gain on the sale of our business that provided augmented reality applications. Other expenses in fiscal 2015 were attributable to a $975 million charge resulting from the resolution reached with the NDRC, charges of $255 million and $11 million for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, respectively, related to our content and push-to-talk services and display businesses and $190 million in restructuring and restructuring-related charges related to our Strategic Realignment Plan, partially offset by $138 million in gains on sales of certain property plant and equipment. Other expenses in fiscal 2014 were comprised of $607 million in certain property, plant and equipment and goodwill impairment charges and $19 million in restructuring-related costs incurred by one of our display businesses, a $16 million goodwill impairment charge related to our former QRS (Qualcomm Retail Solutions) division and a $15 million legal settlement, partially offset by the reversal of a $173 million expense accrual recorded in fiscal 2013 related to the ParkerVision verdict against us, which was overturned.

The effective tax rate for our state income tax provision, net of federal benefit, was negligible for all years presented.During fiscal 2015, the NDRC imposed a fine of $975 million, which was not deductible for tax purposes and was substantially attributable to a foreign jurisdiction. Additionally, during fiscal 2015, we recorded a tax benefit of $101 million related to fiscal 2014 resulting from the United States government reinstating the federal research and development tax credit retroactively to January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 also reflected the United States federal research and development tax credit generated through December 31, 2014, the date on which the credit expired and a $61 million tax benefit as a result of a favorable tax audit settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to Qualcomm Atheros, Inc.’s pre-acquisition 2010 and 2011 tax returns. The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 reflected the tax benefit from the United States federal research and development tax credit generated through December 31, 2013, the date on which the credit previously expired. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 also reflected a tax benefit of $66 million related to fiscal 2013 resulting from an agreement reached with the IRS on components of our fiscal 2013 tax return.The annual effective tax rate for fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 also reflected tax benefits for certain tax incentives obtained in Singapore that commenced in March 2012, including a tax exemption for the first five years, provided that we meet specified employment and other criteria. Our Singapore tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal 2017 and again in fiscal 2027 as a result of the expiration of these incentives.Unrecognized tax benefits were $271 million and $40 million at September 25, 2016 and September 27, 2015, respectively. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to tax positions related to classification of income. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at September 25, 2016 may increase or decrease in the next 12 months.Our Segment ResultsThe following should be read in conjunction with the fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 financial results for each reportable segment included in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.” 44(in millions)QCT QTL QSI2016 Revenues$15,409 $7,664 $47EBT (1)1,812 6,528 386EBT as a % of revenues12% 85% 2015 Revenues$17,154 $7,947 $4EBT (1)2,465 6,882 (74)EBT as a % of revenues14% 87% 2014 Revenues$18,665 $7,569 $—EBT (1)3,807 6,590 (7)EBT as a % of revenues20% 87% (1)Earnings (loss) before taxes.QCT Segment. QCT results of operations in fiscal 2016 were negatively impacted by the effects of a shift in share among our customers within the premium tier, which reduced our sales of integrated Snapdragon processors and skewed our product mix towards lower-margin modem chipsets in this tier, a decline in share at our large customers and the competitive environment in China. The decreases in QCT revenues in fiscal 2016 and 2015 of $1.75 billion and $1.51 billion, respectively, were primarily due to decreases in equipment and services revenues. Equipment and services revenues, mostly related to sales of MSM and accompanying Radio Frequency (RF) and Power Management (PM) integrated circuits, were $15.18 billion, $16.95 billion and $18.43 billion in fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2016 resulted primarily from decreases of $1.35 billion related to lower MSM and accompanying RF and PM unit shipments and $1.14 billion from lower average selling prices and lower-priced product mix, partially offset by a net increase of $753 million in revenues related to other products, primarily related to higher connectivity shipments resulting from the acquisition of CSR in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The decrease in equipment and services revenues in fiscal 2015 resulted primarily from a decrease of $2.89 billion from lower-priced product mix and lower average selling prices, partially offset by an increase of $1.26 billion related to higher MSM and accompanying RF and PM unit shipments. Approximately 842 million, 932 million and 861 million MSM integrated circuits were sold during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2016 as compared to fiscal 2015 primarily due to the impact of lower revenues relative to operating expenses. QCT gross margin percentage remained flat in fiscal 2016 primarily as a result of lower average selling prices and lower-margin product mix, offset by lower average unit costs and lower excess inventory charges. QCT EBT as a percentage of revenues decreased in fiscal 2015 as compared to fiscal 2014 primarily due to a decrease in gross margin percentage and the related impact of lower revenues relative to operating expenses. The decrease in QCT gross margin percentage in fiscal 2015 primarily resulted from lower average selling prices and lower-margin product mix, partially offset by lower average unit costs. QCT gross margin percentage in fiscal 2015 was also impacted by an increase of $179 million in excess inventory charges.QTL Segment. The decrease in QTL revenues in fiscal 2016 of $283 million was primarily attributable to decreases in revenues per reported unit and recognition of unearned license fees, partially offset by an increase in reported sales of CDMA-based products (including multimode products that also implement OFDMA) and $266 million in licensing revenues recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 due to the termination of an infrastructure license agreement resulting from the merger of two licensees. QTL revenues and EBT in fiscal 2016 continued to be impacted negatively by units that we believe are not being reported by certain licensees and sales of certain unlicensed products. While we have reached agreements with many licensees, negotiations with certain other licensees and unlicensed companies are ongoing, and additional litigation may become necessary if negotiations fail to resolve the relevant issues. The increase in QTL revenues in fiscal 2015 of $378 million was primarily due to an increase in sales of CDMA-based products, including multimode products that also implement OFDMA, reported by licensees, partially offset by a decrease in revenues per reported unit. QTL revenues and EBT in fiscal 2015 were impacted negatively by units that we believe were not being reported by certain licensees and sales of certain unlicensed products in China. Also in fiscal 2015, QTL experienced negative fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. 45QSI Segment. The increase in QSI EBT in fiscal 2016 was primarily due to a $380 million gain on the sale of wireless spectrum, an increase of $47 million in net realized gains on investments and a decrease of $21 million in impairment losses on investments. The decrease in QSI EBT in fiscal 2015 of $67 million was primarily due to increases of $32 million in impairment losses on investments and $29 million in equity losses and other costs related to our equity method investments. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOn October 27, 2016, we announced a definitive agreement under which Qualcomm River Holdings will acquire NXP. Pursuant to the definitive agreement, Qualcomm River Holdings will commence a tender offer to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of NXP for $110 per share in cash, for estimated total cash consideration of $38 billion. The transaction is expected to close by the end of calendar 2017 and is subject to receipt of regulatory approvals in various jurisdictions and other closing conditions. We intend to fund the transaction with cash held by foreign entities, which will result in the use of a substantial portion of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as well as new debt, and we secured $13.6 billion in committed financing in connection with signing the definitive agreement.Qualcomm River Holdings and NXP may terminate the definitive agreement under certain circumstances. If the definitive agreement is terminated by NXP in certain circumstances, NXP will be required to pay Qualcomm River Holdings a termination fee of $1.25 billion. If the definitive agreement is terminated by Qualcomm River Holdings under certain circumstances involving the failure to obtain the required regulatory approvals or the failure of NXP to complete certain pre-closing reorganization steps in all material respects, Qualcomm River Holdings will be required to pay NXP a termination fee of $2.0 billion.Our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, cash generated from operations, cash provided by our debt programs and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans. The following table presents selected financial information related to our liquidity as of and for the years ended September 25, 2016 and September 27, 2015 (in millions): 2016 2015 $ Change % ChangeCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities$32,350 $30,947 $1,403 5%Accounts receivable, net2,219 1,964 255 13%Inventories1,556 1,492 64 4%Short-term debt1,749 1,000 749 75%Long-term debt10,008 9,969 39 —%Net cash provided by operating activities7,400 5,506 1,894 34%Net cash used by investing activities(3,488) (3,572) 84 2%Net cash used by financing activities(5,522) (2,261) (3,261) The net increase in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was primarily the result of net cash provided by operating activities and net proceeds from short-term debt, partially offset by $3.9 billion in payments to repurchase shares of our common stock and $3.0 billion in cash dividends paid. Total cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to changes in working capital, which was impacted by a prepayment of $950 million in fiscal 2015 to secure long-term capacity commitments at a supplier of our integrated circuit products, and an increase in net income of $434 million. Our days sales outstanding, on a consolidated basis, were 33 days at September 25, 2016 and September 27, 2015. The increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to the timing of the collection of payments from certain of our licensees. The increase in inventories was primarily due to an increase in the overall quantity of units on hand to align with near-term demand, partially offset by lower average unit costs.Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at September 25, 2016 consisted of $2.8 billion held by United States-based entities and $29.6 billion held by foreign entities. Most of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign entities are indefinitely reinvested and would be subject to material tax effects if repatriated. However, we believe that our United States sources of cash and liquidity are sufficient to meet our business needs in the United States and do not expect that we will need to repatriate the funds. We believe our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, our expected cash flow generated from operations and our expected financing activities will satisfy our working and other capital requirements for at least the next 12 months based on our current business plans. Recent and expected working and other capital requirements, in addition to our proposed acquisition of NXP, also include the items described below. 46•Our purchase obligations at September 25, 2016, some of which relate to research and development activities and capital expenditures, totaled $4.2 billion and $886 million for fiscal 2017 and 2018, respectively, and $1.0 billion thereafter. •Our research and development expenditures were $5.2 billion and $5.5 billion during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively, and we expect to continue to invest heavily in research and development for new technologies, applications and services for voice and data communications.•Cash outflows for capital expenditures were $539 million and $994 million during fiscal 2016 and 2015, respectively. We expect to continue to incur capital expenditures in the future to support our business, including research and development activities. Future capital expenditures may be impacted by transactions that are currently not forecasted.•In January 2016, we announced that we had reached agreement with TDK Corporation to form a joint venture, under the name RF360 Holdings Singapore Pte. Ltd. The joint venture will initially be owned 51% by us and 49% by TDK. The purchase price due upon close of the transaction is $1.2 billion, to be adjusted for working capital, outstanding indebtedness and certain capital expenditures, among other things. Additionally, we have the option to acquire (and TDK has an option to sell) TDK’s interest in the joint venture for $1.15 billion 30 months after the closing date. We expect to use existing cash resources to fund the acquisition. TDK will be entitled to up to a total of $200 million in payments based on sales of RF filter functions over the three-year period after the closing date. The transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions and is expected to close in early calendar 2017.•We expect to continue making strategic investments and acquisitions, the amounts of which could vary significantly, to open new opportunities for our technologies, obtain development resources, grow our patent portfolio or pursue new businesses.Debt. We have a Revolving Credit Facility that provides for unsecured revolving facility loans, swing line loans and letters of credit in an aggregate amount of up to $4.0 billion, expiring in February 2020. At September 25, 2016, no amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility.We have an unsecured commercial paper program, which provides for the issuance of up to $4.0 billion of commercial paper. Net proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. At September 25, 2016, we had $1.7 billion of commercial paper outstanding with weighted-average net interest rates of 0.52% and weighted-average remaining days to maturity of 36 days.In May 2015, we issued an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion in eight tranches of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes, with maturity dates in 2018 through 2045 and effective interest rates between 0.93% and 4.74%. Interest is payable in arrears quarterly for the floating-rate notes and semi-annually for the fixed-rate notes. In addition to the new debt we expect to issue in connection with our proposed acquisition of NXP, we may also issue debt in the future. The amount and timing of such additional borrowings will be subject to a number of factors, including the cash flow generated by United States-based entities, acquisitions and strategic investments, acceptable interest rates and changes in corporate income tax law, among other factors. Additional information regarding our outstanding debt at September 25, 2016 is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6. Debt.” Capital Return Program. The following table summarizes stock repurchases and dividends paid during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014 (in millions, except per-share amounts): Stock Repurchase Program Dividends Total Shares Average Price Paid Per Share Amount Per Share Amount Amount2016 73.8 $53.16 $3,922 $2.02 $2,990 $6,9122015 172.4 65.21 11,245 1.80 2,880 14,1252014 60.3 75.48 4,548 1.54 2,586 7,134On March 9, 2015, we announced that we had been authorized to repurchase up to $15 billion of our common stock. Additionally, we announced our intention to repurchase $10 billion of stock from March 2015 through March 2016, which we completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2016. At September 25, 2016, $3.0 billion remained authorized for repurchase under our stock repurchase program. Since September 25, 2016, we repurchased and retired 1,865,000 shares of common 47stock for $124 million. As a result of our proposed acquisition of NXP and the pending use of our cash and marketable securities, we currently expect to repurchase shares during the next few years to offset dilution. We periodically evaluate repurchases as a means of returning capital to stockholders to determine when and if repurchases are in the best interests of our stockholders.On October 6, 2016, we announced a cash dividend of $0.53 per share on our common stock, payable on December 16, 2016 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on November 30, 2016. We intend to continue to use cash dividends as a means of returning capital to stockholders, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders.Contractual Obligations/Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe have no significant contractual obligations not fully recorded on our consolidated balance sheets or fully disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. We have no material off-balance sheet arrangements as defined in Regulation S-K 303(a)(4)(ii).The following table summarizes the payments due by fiscal period for our outstanding contractual obligations at September 25, 2016 (in millions): Total 2017 2018-2019 2020-2021 Beyond2021 NoExpirationDatePurchase obligations (1)$6,104 $4,204 $1,635 $260 $5 $—Operating lease obligations338 94 132 76 36 —Equity funding and financing commitments (2)251 16 87 12 134 2Long-term debt (3)10,000 — 1,500 2,000 6,500 —Other long-term liabilities (4)(5)240 4 191 31 3 11Total contractual obligations$16,933 $4,318 $3,545 $2,379 $6,678 $13(1)Total purchase obligations include commitments to purchase integrated circuit product inventories of $3.4 billion, $766 million, $673 million and $158 million for each of the subsequent four years from fiscal 2017 through 2020, respectively; there were no such purchase commitments thereafter. Integrated circuit product inventory obligations represent purchase commitments for semiconductor die, finished goods and manufacturing services, such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and final test. Under our manufacturing relationships with our foundry suppliers and assembly and test service providers, cancelation of outstanding purchase orders is generally allowed but requires payment of all costs incurred through the date of cancelation, and in some cases, incremental fees related to capacity underutilization. (2)Certain of these commitments do not have fixed funding dates and are subject to certain conditions. Commitments represent the maximum amounts to be funded under these arrangements; actual funding may be in lesser amounts or not at all.(3)The amounts noted herein represent contractual payments of principal only.(4)Certain long-term liabilities reflected on our balance sheet, such as unearned revenues, are not presented in this table because they do not require cash settlement in the future. Other long-term liabilities as presented in this table include the related current portions, as applicable.(5)Our consolidated balance sheet at September 25, 2016 included $140 million in noncurrent liabilities for uncertain tax positions, some of which may result in cash payment. The future payments related to uncertain tax positions have not been presented in the table above due to the uncertainty of the amounts and timing of cash settlement with the taxing authorities.Additional information regarding our financial commitments at September 25, 2016 is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 3. Income Taxes,” “Note 6. Debt” and “Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”Recent Accounting PronouncementsInformation regarding recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of those pronouncements, if any, on our consolidated financial statements is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies.” 48Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market RiskInterest Rate Risk - Debt and Interest Rate Swap Agreements. We issued an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 billion of unsecured floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying maturity dates. We also entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion to effectively convert certain fixed-rate interest payments into floating-rate payments. The interest rates on our floating-rate notes and interest rate swaps are based on LIBOR. By issuing the floating-rate notes and entering into the interest rate swap agreements, we have assumed risks associated with variable interest rates based upon LIBOR. At September 25, 2016, a hypothetical increase in LIBOR-based interest rates of 100 basis points would cause our interest expense to increase by $30 million on an annualized basis as it relates to our floating-rate notes and the interest rate swap agreements.Additionally, we have a commercial paper program that provides for the issuance of up to $4.0 billion of commercial paper. At September 25, 2016, we had $1.7 billion of commercial paper outstanding, with original maturities of less than 4 months. Changes in interest rates could affect the amounts of interest that we pay if we refinance the current outstanding commercial paper with new debt.Additional information regarding our notes and related interest rate swap agreements and commercial paper program is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies” and “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 6. Debt.”Interest Rate Risk - Investment Portfolio. We invest a portion of our cash in a number of diversified fixed- and floating- rate securities, consisting of cash equivalents, marketable debt securities, debt funds and derivative instruments related to our investment portfolio (including interest rate swaps) that are subject to interest rate risk. Changes in the general level of interest rates can affect the fair value of our investment portfolio. If interest rates in the general economy were to rise, our holdings could lose value. At September 25, 2016, a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 100 basis points across the entire yield curve on our holdings would have resulted in a decrease of $501 million in the fair value of our holdings.Equity Price Risk. We hold a diversified marketable securities portfolio that includes equity securities and fund shares that are subject to equity price risk. We have made investments in marketable equity securities of companies of varying size, style, industry and geography, and changes in investment allocations may affect the price volatility of our investments. A 10% decrease in the market price of our marketable equity securities and fund shares at September 25, 2016 would have caused a decrease in the carrying amounts of these securities of $175 million. At September 25, 2016, gross unrealized losses of our marketable equity securities and fund shares were $12 million. Although we consider the unrealized losses to be temporary, there is a risk that we may incur other-than-temporary impairment charges or realized losses on the values of these securities if they do not recover in value within a reasonable period.We also hold investments in non-marketable equity instruments in privately held companies that may be impacted by equity price risks. Volatility in the equity markets could negatively affect our investees’ ability to raise additional capital as well as our ability to realize value from our investments through initial public offerings, mergers and private sales. Consequently, we could incur other-than-temporary impairment losses or realized losses on all or a part of the values of our non-marketable equity investments. At September 25, 2016, the carrying value of our non-marketable equity investments was $855 million and was included in other noncurrent assets.Foreign Exchange Risk. We manage our exposure to foreign exchange market risks, when deemed appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments, including foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial counterparties. We utilize such derivative financial instruments for hedging or risk management purposes rather than for speculation purposes. Counterparties to our derivative contracts are all major banking institutions. In the event of the financial insolvency or distress of a counterparty to our derivative financial instruments, we may be unable to settle transactions if the counterparty does not provide us with sufficient collateral to secure its net settlement obligations to us, which could have a negative impact on our results. A description of our foreign currency accounting policies is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. The Company and Its Significant Accounting Policies.”At September 25, 2016, our net liability related to foreign currency option and forward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency risk (on royalties earned from certain licensees on their sales of CDMA-based devices) was negligible. If our forecasted royalty revenues for currencies in which we hedge were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in our hedged foreign currency, we would not incur a loss as our hedge positions would continue to be fully effective.At September 25, 2016, our net asset related to foreign currency option and forward contracts designated as hedges of foreign currency risk (on certain operating expenditure transactions) was negligible. If our forecasted operating expenditures 49for currencies in which we hedge were to decline by 20% and foreign exchange rates were to change unfavorably by 20% in our hedged foreign currency, we would incur a negligible loss.Financial assets and liabilities held by consolidated subsidiaries that are not denominated in the functional currency of those entities are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations and may affect reported earnings. As a global company, we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates. We may hedge currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in nonfunctional currencies and certain anticipated nonfunctional currency transactions. As a result, we could experience unanticipated gains or losses on anticipated foreign currency cash flows, as well as economic loss with respect to the recoverability of investments. While we may hedge certain transactions with non-United States customers, declines in currency values in certain regions may, if not reversed, adversely affect future product sales because our products may become more expensive to purchase in the countries of the affected currencies.Our analysis methods used to assess and mitigate the risks discussed above should not be considered projections of future risks.",2023-12-30 18:21:47.492793
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2017,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the “Our Business and Operating Segments” section under the heading “Seasonality.”Strategic Realignment PlanIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we announced a Strategic Realignment Plan designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth as we worked to create sustainable long-term value for stockholders. As part of this Strategic Realignment Plan, among other actions, we implemented a cost reduction plan, which included a series of targeted reductions across our businesses, particularly in QCT, and a reduction to annual share-based compensation grants. The cost reduction initiatives were achieved by the end of fiscal 2016 and other activities under the plan were completed by the end of fiscal 2017. Additional information regarding our Strategic Realignment Plan is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10. Strategic Realignment Plan.”Corporate StructureWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operations and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by QUALCOMM Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.Revenue Concentrations, Significant Customers and Geographical Information Revenues in fiscal 2017 were negatively impacted by the actions of Apple Inc. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd./Foxconn, its affiliates and other suppliers to Apple, as well as the previously disclosed dispute with another licensee, who underpaid royalties due in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 and did not report or pay royalties due in the third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. A small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, revenues from suppliers to Apple Inc. and from Samsung Electronics each comprised more than 10% of consolidated revenues. Combined revenues from GuangDong OPPO Mobile Telecommunications Corp. Ltd. and vivo Communication Technology Co., Ltd., and their respective affiliates, also comprised more than 10% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2017. Consolidated revenues from international customers and licensees as a percentage of total revenues were 98%, 98% and 99% in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During fiscal 2017, 65% and 16% of our revenues were from customers and licensees based in China (including Hong Kong) and South Korea, respectively, compared to 57% and 17% during fiscal 2016, respectively, and 53% and 16% during fiscal 2015, respectively. We report revenues from external customers by country based on the location to which our products or services are delivered, which for QCT is generally the country in which our customers manufacture their products, or for licensing revenues, the invoiced addresses of our licensees. As a result, the revenues by country presented herein are not necessarily indicative of either the country in which the devices 14containing our products and/or intellectual property are ultimately sold to consumers or the country in which the companies that sell the devices are headquartered. For example, China revenues could include revenues related to shipments of integrated circuits to a company that is headquartered in South Korea but that manufactures devices in China, which devices are then sold to consumers in Europe and/or the United States. Additional geographic information is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.”Research and DevelopmentThe communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in CDMA, OFDMA and a broad range of other technologies. Using these engineering resources, we expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products, including continuing the development of CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies, developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies, assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world and leveraging our existing technology in new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, IoT and networking. Our research and development team has a demonstrated track record of innovation in voice and data communication technologies and application processor technology, among others. Our research and development expenditures in fiscal 2017, 2016 and 2015 totaled approximately $5.5 billion, $5.2 billion and $5.5 billion, respectively.We continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in 4G OFDMA-based technologies (including LTE) and 5G-based technologies. We also engage in acquisitions and other transactions, such as joint ventures, to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or open or expand opportunities for our technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products and services) for voice and data communications and new industry segments outside of the traditional cellular industry. Recent transactions include our acquisition of CSR plc, our RF360 Holdings joint venture with TDK Corporation and our proposed acquisition of NXP. We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets and laptops), consumer electronics and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G and 4G LTE technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including WLAN, Bluetooth, Ethernet, GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other mobile client software environments in our chipsets.We develop on our own, and with our partners, innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition.We have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world that support our global development activities and ongoing efforts to develop and/or advance 4G OFDMA, 5G and a broad range of other technologies. We continue to use our substantial engineering resources and expertise to develop new technologies, applications and services and make them available to licensees to help grow the communications industry and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities.We also make investments in opportunities that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and enter into adjacent industry segments, such as products for automotive, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics), data center, networking, computing and machine learning, among others.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing activities of our operating segments are discussed under Operating Segments. Other marketing activities include public relations, advertising, digital marketing and social media, participation in technical conferences and trade shows, development of business cases and white papers, competitive analyses, industry intelligence and other marketing programs, such as marketing development funds with our customers. Our Corporate Marketing department provides company information on our Internet site and through other channels regarding our products, strategies and technology to industry analysts and media. 15CompetitionCompetition faced by our operating segments is discussed under Operating Segments. Competition in the communications industry throughout the world continues to increase at a rapid pace as consumers, businesses and governments realize the potential of wireless communications products and services. We have facilitated competition in the wireless communications industry by licensing our technologies to a large number of manufacturers. Although we have attained a significant position in the traditional cellular industry, many of our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products, to use our competitors’ integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, including by bundling with other products, or to choose alternative technologies; lower cost structures and/or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices and lower or negative margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies or competitors; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and original equipment manufacturers in certain geographic regions (such as China) and/or experience in adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries (such as automotive and IoT); and/or a more established presence in certain regions. These relationships may affect customers’ decisions to purchase products or license technology from us. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market positions to our detriment.We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings and introduce new technologies and services in the future and as additional companies compete with our products or services based on 3G, 4G or other technologies. Although we intend to continue to make substantial investments in developing new products and technologies and improving existing products and technologies, our competitors may introduce alternative products, services or technologies that threaten our business. It is also possible that the prices we charge for our products and services may continue to decline as competition continues to intensify. See also the Risk Factor entitled “Our industry is subject to competition in an environment of rapid technological change that could result in decreased demand and/or declining average selling prices for our products and/or those of our customers and/or licensees.”Corporate Responsibility and SustainabilityWe strive to better our local and global communities through ethical business practices, socially empowering technology applications, educational and environmental programs and employee diversity and volunteerism.•Our Governance.

Risk FactorsYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business and results of operations, and require significant management time and attention. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Risks Related to Our BusinessesOur proposed acquisition of NXP Semiconductors N.V. involves a number of risks, including, among others, the risk that we fail to complete the acquisition, in a timely manner or at all, regulatory risks, risks associated with our use of a significant portion of our cash and our taking on significant indebtedness, other financial risks, integration risks, and risk associated with the reactions of customers, suppliers and employees.Our and NXP’s obligations to consummate the proposed transaction are subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, including, among others: (i) the tender of a minimum number of NXP’s outstanding common shares in the tender offer commenced by a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated; (ii) the receipt of regulatory clearance under European Union and certain other foreign antitrust laws; (iii) the absence of any law or order prohibiting the proposed transaction; (iv) there being no event that would have a material adverse effect on NXP; (v) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of NXP, subject to certain exceptions, and NXP’s material compliance with its covenants, in the definitive agreement; and (vi) the completion of certain internal reorganization steps with respect to NXP and the disposition of certain non-core assets of NXP. We cannot provide assurance that the conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all, and if the proposed transaction is not completed, we would not realize any of the expected benefits.The regulatory approvals required in connection with the proposed transaction may not be obtained or may contain materially burdensome conditions. If any conditions or changes to the structure of the proposed transaction are required to obtain these regulatory approvals, they may have the effect of jeopardizing or delaying completion of the proposed transaction or reducing our anticipated benefits. If we agree to any material conditions in order to obtain any approvals required to complete the proposed transaction, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected. 18In addition, the use of a significant portion of our cash and the incurrence of substantial indebtedness in connection with the financing of the proposed transaction will reduce our liquidity, and may limit our flexibility in responding to other business opportunities and increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions. See the Risk Factor entitled “There are risks associated with our indebtedness.”If the proposed transaction is not completed, our stock price could fall to the extent that our current price reflects an assumption that we will complete it. Furthermore, if the proposed transaction is not completed and the purchase agreement is terminated, we would not realize any of the expected benefits of the proposed transaction, and we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and stock price, including, among others:•we could be required to pay a termination fee to NXP of $2.0 billion; •we will have incurred and may continue to incur costs relating to the proposed transaction, many of which are payable by us whether or not the proposed transaction is completed;•matters relating to the proposed transaction (including integration planning) require substantial commitments of time and resources by our management team and numerous others throughout our organization, which could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities;•we may be subject to legal proceedings related to the proposed transaction or the failure to complete the proposed transaction;•the failure to consummate the proposed transaction may result in negative publicity and a negative perception of us in the investment community; and•any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the proposed transaction, including any adverse changes in our relationships with our customers, suppliers, partners or employees, may continue or intensify in the event the proposed transaction is not consummated. The proposed transaction will be our largest acquisition to date, by a significant margin. The benefits we expect to realize from the proposed transaction will depend, in part, on our ability to integrate the businesses successfully and efficiently. See the Risk Factor entitled “We may engage in strategic acquisitions, transactions or make investments that could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.”Furthermore, uncertainties about the proposed transaction may cause our and/or NXP’s current and prospective employees to experience uncertainty about their futures. These uncertainties may impair our and/or NXP’s ability to retain, recruit or motivate key management, engineering, technical and other personnel. Similarly, our and/or NXP’s existing or prospective customers, licensees, suppliers and/or partners may delay, defer or cease purchasing products or services from or providing products or services to us or NXP; delay or defer other decisions concerning us or NXP; or otherwise seek to change the terms on which they do business with us or NXP. Any of the above could harm us and/or NXP, and thus decrease the benefits we expect to receive from the proposed transaction. The proposed transaction may also result in significant charges or other liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations, such as cash expenses and non-cash accounting charges incurred in connection with our acquisition and/or integration of the business and operations of NXP. Further, our failure to identify or accurately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities we are assuming in the proposed transaction could result in unexpected litigation or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting charges, unexpected increases in taxes due, a loss of anticipated tax benefits or other adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Our revenues depend on commercial network deployments, expansions and upgrades of CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies; our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on these technologies; and customers’ demand for our products and services.We develop, patent and commercialize technology and products based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, which are primarily wireless. We depend on operators of wireless networks and our customers and licensees to adopt and/or implement the latest generation of these technologies for use in their networks, devices and services. We also depend on our customers and licensees to develop devices and services based on these technologies with value-added features to drive consumer demand for new 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G devices, and in the future 5G devices, as well as establishing the selling prices for such devices. Further, we depend on the timing of our customers’ and licensees’ deployments of new devices and services based on these technologies. Increasingly, we also depend on operators of wireless networks, our customers and licensees and other third parties to incorporate these technologies into new device types and into industries beyond traditional cellular communications, such as automotive, the internet of things (IoT) (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics), data center, networking, computing, and machine 19learning, among others. We are also impacted by consumers’ rates of replacement of smartphones and other computing devices. Our revenues and/or growth in revenues could be negatively impacted, our business may be harmed and our substantial investments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return, if:•wireless operators and industries beyond traditional cellular communications deploy alternative technologies;•wireless operators delay next-generation network deployments, expansions or upgrades and/or delay moving 2G customers to 3G, 3G/4G multimode or 4G wireless devices;•LTE, an OFDMA-based 4G wireless technology, is not more widely deployed or further commercial deployment is delayed;•government regulators delay making sufficient spectrum available for 3G, 4G, new unlicensed technologies that we are developing in conjunction with 3G and 4G, as well as for 5G, thereby restricting the ability of wireless operators to deploy or expand the use of these technologies;•wireless operators delay or do not drive improvements in 3G, 4G or 3G/4G multimode network performance and/or capacity;•our customers’ and licensees’ revenues and sales of products, particularly premium-tier products, and services using these technologies do not grow or do not grow as quickly as anticipated due to, for example, the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed regions;•our intellectual property and technical leadership included in the 5G standardization effort is different than in 3G and 4G standards;•the standardization and/or deployment of 5G technology is delayed; and/or•we are unable to drive the adoption of our products and services into networks and devices, including devices beyond traditional cellular applications, based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies.Our industry is subject to competition in an environment of rapid technological change that could result in decreased demand and/or declining average selling prices for our products and/or those of our customers and/or licensees.Our products, services and technologies face significant competition. We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to attract new business and/or customers, as new opportunities develop and as new competitors enter the industry. Competition in wireless communications is affected by various factors that include, among others: device manufacturer concentrations and vertical integration; growth in demand, consumption and competition in certain geographic regions; government intervention and/or support of national industries and/or competitors; evolving industry standards and business models; evolving methods of transmission of voice and data communications; increasing data traffic and densification of wireless networks; convergence and aggregation of connectivity technologies (including Wi-Fi and LTE) in both devices and access points; consolidation of wireless technologies and infrastructure at the network edge; networking and connectivity trends (including cloud services); use of both licensed and unlicensed spectrum; the evolving nature of computing (including demand for always on, always connected capabilities); the speed of technological change (including the transition to smaller geometry process technologies); value-added features that drive selling prices as well as consumer demand for new 3G, 3G/4G multimode and 4G devices; turnkey, integrated products that incorporate hardware, software, user interface, applications and reference designs; scalability; and the ability of the system technology to meet customers’ immediate and future network requirements. We anticipate that additional competitors will introduce products as a result of growth opportunities in wireless communications, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, technological and public policy changes and relatively low barriers to entry in certain segments of the industry. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape.We expect that our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:•differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features (e.g., modem, radio frequency front-end (RFFE), graphics and/or other processors, camera and connectivity) and with smaller geometry process technologies that drive performance;•develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points to effectively cover both emerging and developed geographic regions and all device tiers; 20•continue to drive the adoption of our integrated circuit products into the most popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops, other computing devices, automobiles, wearables and voice and music and other connected devices and infrastructure products;•maintain and/or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit products at the premium device tier, while increasing the adoption of our products in mid- and low-tier devices, in part by strengthening our integrated circuit product roadmap for, and developing channel relationships in, emerging geographic regions, such as China and India, and by providing turnkey products, which incorporate our integrated circuits, for low- and mid-tier smartphones, tablets and laptops;•continue to be a leader in 4G technology evolution, including expansion of our LTE-based single mode licensing program in areas where single-mode products are commercialized, and continue to innovate and introduce 4G turnkey, integrated products and services that differentiate us from our competition;•be a leader serving original equipment manufacturers, high level operating systems (HLOS) providers, operators, cloud providers and other industry participants as competitors, new industry entrants and other factors continue to affect the industry landscape;•be a preferred partner (and sustain preferred relationships) providing integrated circuit products that support multiple operating system and infrastructure platforms to industry participants that effectively commercialize new devices using these platforms;•increase and/or accelerate demand for our semiconductor component products, including RFFE, and our wired and wireless connectivity products, including networking products for consumers, carriers and enterprise equipment and connected devices;•identify potential acquisition targets that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic needs, reach agreement on terms acceptable to us and effectively integrate these new businesses and/or technologies;•create standalone value and/or contribute to the success of our existing businesses through acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions (and/or by developing customer, licensee and/or vendor relationships) in new industry segments and/or disruptive technologies, products and/or services (such as products for automotive, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics), data center, networking, computing, and machine learning, among others); •become a leading supplier of RFFE products, which are designed to address cellular radio frequency band fragmentation while improving radio frequency performance and assist original equipment manufacturers in developing multiband, multimode mobile devices; •be a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing and develop and commercialize 5G integrated circuit products and services; and/or•continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in computing and other consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging geographic regions.Competition in any or all product tiers may result in the loss of certain business or customers, which would negatively impact our revenues, results of operations and cash flows. Such competition may also reduce average selling prices for our chipset products and/or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging geographic regions where competitors may have lower cost structures and/or may have a willingness and ability to accept lower prices and/or lower or negative margins on their products (particularly in China). Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees’ products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.Companies that promote standards that are neither CDMA- nor OFDMA-based (e.g., GSM) as well as companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Broadcom Limited, Cirrus Logic, Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, HiSilicon Technologies, Intel, Marvell Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, MediaTek, Microchip Technology Inc., Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Nordic Semiconductor, Nvidia, Qorvo Inc., Realtek Semiconductor, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Sequans Communications S.A., Skyworks Solutions Inc., Sony Corporation and Spreadtrum Communications (which is controlled by Tsinghua Unigroup). Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain 21circumstances to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products, to use our competitors’ integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, including by bundling with other products, or to choose alternative technologies; lower cost structures and/or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices and lower or negative margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies or competitors; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and original equipment manufacturers in certain geographic regions (such as China) and/or experience in adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries (such as automotive and IoT); and/or a more established presence in certain regions. We derive a significant portion of our consolidated revenues from a small number of customers and licensees. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.Our QCT segment derives a significant portion of its revenues from a small number of customers, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. In addition, certain of our largest integrated circuit customers develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past chosen, and may in the future choose, to utilize in certain of their devices rather than our integrated circuit products (and/or sell their integrated circuit products to third parties in competition with us). Also, one of our largest integrated circuit customers has utilized products of one of our competitors in certain of their devices rather than our products. The loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by such customers or the cancelation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products, our competitors’ integrated circuit products or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations, and a delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development. Further, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers’ new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate. Accordingly, if current industry dynamics and concentrations continue, our QCT segment’s revenues will continue to depend largely upon, and be impacted by, future purchases, and the timing and size of any such future purchases, by these significant customers.One of our largest customers purchases our Mobile Data Modem (MDM) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. To the extent such customer takes device share from our other customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted. Further, companies that develop HLOS for devices, including leading technology companies, now sell their own devices. If we fail to effectively partner or continue partnering with these companies, or with their partners or customers, they may decide not to purchase (either directly or through their contract manufacturers), or to reduce or discontinue their purchases of, our integrated circuit products.In addition, there has been and continues to be litigation among certain of our customers and other industry participants, and the potential outcomes of such litigation, including but not limited to injunctions against devices that incorporate our products and/or intellectual property, or rulings on certain patent law or patent licensing issues that create new legal precedent, could impact our business, particularly if such action impacts one of our larger customers.Although we have several hundred licensees, our QTL segment derives a significant portion of its licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and/or payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of such license agreements under similar terms, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We have no control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our significant licensees, without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues. 22We derive a significant portion of our consolidated revenues from the premium-tier device segment. If sales of premium-tier devices decrease, and/or sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products decrease, our results of operations could be negatively affected.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from the premium-tier device segment, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, lengthening replacement cycles in developed regions, where premium-tier smartphones are common; increasing consumer demand in emerging regions, particularly China and India, where premium-tier smartphones are less common and replacement cycles are on average longer than in developed regions; and/or a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and/or innovation cycles. In addition, as discussed in the prior risk factor, our industry is experiencing concentration of device share among a few companies at the premium tier, which gives them significant supply chain leverage. Further, those companies may utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products, or our competitors’ integrated circuit products, rather than our products in a portion of their devices. These dynamics may result in lower prices for and/or reduced sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products.A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, or a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), may reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.Efforts by some communications equipment manufacturers or their customers to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions and/or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.From time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to renegotiate, mitigate and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity and/or unenforceability of our patents and/or licenses, that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and other organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, the imposition of some form of compulsory licensing and/or to weaken a patent holder’s ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) licensees using various strategies to attempt to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers that results in lowering the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price on which the royalty is calculated. In addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported and/or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and licensees and/or companies may continue to do so in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report and/or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and/or companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment and/or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows will be exacerbated.We are currently subject to various litigation and governmental investigations and/or proceedings, some of which have arisen and may continue to arise out of the strategies described above. Certain legal matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Depending on the type of matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that 23country or region. See also the Risk Factor entitled “If we are required to change our patent licensing practices due to governmental investigations and/or private legal proceedings challenging those practices, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.”In addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments. Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our patent portfolio.Further, some companies or entities have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and/or have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by severely limiting the base upon which the royalty percentage may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (and/or other companies’) alleged failure to abide by these policies.Some SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted and may in the future adopt some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party.We expect that such proposals, interpretations and strategies will continue in the future, and if successful, our business model would be harmed, either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalties (or by reducing the royalties we can collect) on all or a portion of our patent portfolio, limiting our return on investment with respect to new technologies, limiting our ability to seek injunctions against infringers of our standard-essential patents, constraining our ability to make licensing commitments when submitting our technology for inclusion in future standards (which could make our technology less likely to be included in such standards) or forcing us to work outside of SDOs or other industry groups to promote our new technologies, and our revenues, results of operations and/or cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, the legal and other costs associated with asserting or defending our positions have been and continue to be significant. We assume that such challenges, regardless of their merits, will continue into the foreseeable future and may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources.Our business, particularly our licensing business, may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or proceedings.We are currently subject to various governmental investigations and/or proceedings, particularly with respect to our licensing business, and certain such matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” Key allegations in those matters include, among others, that we do not license our cellular standard-essential patents separately from our other patents, that we violate FRAND licensing commitments by refusing to grant licenses to chipset makers, that our royalty rates are too high and/or that the base on which our royalties are calculated should be something less than the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of the applicable device (minus certain permitted deductions). The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Depending on the type of matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, and the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. See also the Risk Factor entitled “If we are required to change our patent licensing practices due to governmental investigations and/or private legal proceedings challenging those practices, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.”If we are required to change our patent licensing practices due to governmental investigations and/or private legal proceedings challenging those practices, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.We are currently subject to various governmental investigations and private legal proceedings challenging our patent licensing practices as described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” Key allegations in those matters include, among others, that we do not license our cellular standard-essential patents separately from our other patents, that we violate FRAND licensing commitments by refusing to 24grant licenses to chipset makers, that our royalty rates are too high and/or that the base on which our royalties are calculated should be something less than the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of the applicable device (minus certain permitted deductions). We believe that the ultimate intent of these investigations and legal proceedings is to reduce the amount of royalties that licensees are required to pay to us for their use of our intellectual property.We have historically licensed our cellular standard-essential patents together with our other patents that may be useful to licensed products because licensees typically have desired to obtain the commercial benefits of receiving such broad patent rights from us. However, we also have licensed only our cellular standard-essential patents to certain licensees who have requested such licenses. In addition, in connection with our resolution with the China National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) in China, our standard practice in China since 2015 is to offer licenses for our 3G and 4G standard-essential Chinese patents for branded devices sold for use in China separately from licenses to our other patents. If we were required to separately license our cellular standard-essential patents to all of our licensees worldwide, and more licensees chose such a license instead of a portfolio license than has historically been the case, our licensing revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted unless we were able to license our other patents at rates that offset all or a portion of any difference between the royalties previously received for licenses of substantially all of our patent portfolio as compared to licenses of only our cellular standard-essential patents and/or there was a sufficient increase in the overall volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid.If we were required to grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers (i.e., to implement a more complex, tiered licensing structure in which we license certain portions of our patent portfolio to chipset manufacturers and other portions to device manufacturers), we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, and we may incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed. In addition, our licensing revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain, in the aggregate, equivalent revenues under such a multi-level licensing structure.If we were required to reduce the royalty rates we charge under our patent license agreements, our revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted absent a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid. Similarly, if we were required to reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, our revenues, results of operations and/or cash flows would be negatively impacted unless there was a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid and/or we were able to increase our royalty rates to offset the decrease in revenues resulting from such lower royalty base (assuming the absolute royalty dollars were below any relevant royalty caps).To the extent that we were required to implement any of these new licensing practices by modifying or renegotiating our existing license agreements, we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, and we may incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed. The impact of any such changes to our licensing practices could vary widely and by jurisdiction, depending on the specific outcomes and the geographic scope of such outcomes. In addition, if we were required to make modifications to our licensing practices in one jurisdiction, licensees and/or governmental agencies in other jurisdictions may attempt to obtain similar outcomes for themselves and/or for such other jurisdictions, as applicable.The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and/or could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property rights and/or by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions.We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, international treaties and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and proprietary information is difficult and time consuming. The steps we have taken have not always prevented, and we cannot be certain the steps we will take in the future will prevent, the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary intellectual property rights as fully or as readily as United States laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective. Some industry participants who have a vested interest in devaluing patents in general, or standard-essential patents in particular, have mounted attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established patent laws. In the United States, there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law changes and current and potential future litigation regarding patents, the outcomes of which could be detrimental to our licensing business. The laws in certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including certain countries in Asia, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States. We expect that the European Union will adopt a unitary patent system in the next few years that may broadly impact that region’s patent regime. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any 25potential changes. In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of any standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in the future in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our products or technologies.We have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights and/or contracts, including collecting royalties for use of our patent portfolio due to, among others: refusal by certain licensees to report and/or pay all or a portion of the royalties they owe to us; policies of foreign governments; challenges to our licensing practices under competition laws; adoption of mandatory licensing provisions by foreign jurisdictions (either with controlled/regulated royalties or royalty free); failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce judgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and/or challenges before competition agencies to our licensing business and/or the pricing and integration of additional features and functionality into our chipset products. Certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported and/or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or delayed entering into or renewing license agreements for their use of our intellectual property, and such licensees and/or companies may continue to do so in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report and/or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or not enter into, new license agreements. Additionally, although our license agreements provide us with the right to audit the books and records of licensees, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. Further, certain licensees may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their books and records. To the extent we do not aggressively enforce our rights under our license agreements, licensees may not comply with their existing license agreements, and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed companies to enter into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, other unlicensed companies may not enter into license agreements.We have entered into litigation in the past and may need to further litigate in the future to enforce our contract and/or intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. We are currently engaged in litigation matters related to protecting or enforcing our contract and/or intellectual property rights, and certain such matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable (which may in turn result in other licensees either not complying with their existing license agreements and/or initiating litigation) and/or we could incur substantial costs. Any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our results of operations and/or cash flows. Further, even a positive resolution to our enforcement efforts may take time to conclude, which may reduce our revenues and cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development, in the periods prior to conclusion. See also the Risk Factor entitled “If we are required to change our patent licensing practices due to governmental investigations and/or private legal proceedings challenging those practices, our business and results of operations could be adversely impacted.”Our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our technologies, products and services into new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, IoT and networking, among others. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas and industry segments, and related technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing technologies, products and services and new technologies, such as 5G, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, and we must make substantial research, development and other investments, such as acquisitions, in new products, services and technologies to compete successfully. Technological innovations generally require significant research and development efforts before they are commercially viable. While we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G OFDMA- and 5G-based technologies, we also innovate across a broad spectrum of opportunities to deploy new and expanded products and enter into adjacent industry segments by leveraging our existing technical and business expertise and/or through acquisitions.In particular, our future growth significantly depends on new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments, such as automotive, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics) data center, networking, computing, and machine learning, among others; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies, products and services for new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments; and third 26parties incorporating our technology, products and services into devices used in these product areas and industry segments. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments, and in developing new products, services and technologies for these product areas and industry segments.However, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments, and corresponding technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing, technologies, products and services and new technologies, such as 5G, use of both licensed and unlicensed spectrum, and convergence of cellular and Wi-Fi, may not succeed due to, among others: new industry segments and/or consumer demand may not grow as anticipated; our strategies and/or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be successful; improvements in alternate technologies in ways that reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors’ products or services being more cost effective, having more capabilities or fewer limitations or being brought to market faster than our new products and services; and competitors having longer operating histories in industry segments that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of or overestimate the future revenues and/or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns. Further, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in a significant barrier to entry and increased costs.If our new technologies, products and/or services are not successful, or are not successful in the time frame we anticipate, we may incur significant costs and/or asset impairments, our business may not grow as anticipated, our revenues and/or margins may be negatively impacted and/or our reputation may be harmed.There are numerous risks associated with our operation and control of manufacturing facilities we acquired through the formation of our joint venture with TDK, RF360 Holdings, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model, environmental compliance and liability, exposure to natural disasters, timely supply of equipment and materials and manufacturing difficulties.Manufacturing facilities are characterized by a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model. In less favorable industry environments, in particular, we may be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products. During such periods, our manufacturing facilities could operate at lower capacity levels, while the fixed costs associated with full capacity continue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit.We are subject to many environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing facilities, which govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We cannot make assurances that we will be at all times in compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several, liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances. Certain of these laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. In addition, we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.We have manufacturing facilities in Asia and Europe. If tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts were to damage, destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facilities, it could disrupt our operations, delay new production and shipments of inventory or result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs. In addition, natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts may result in disruptions in transportation, distribution channels or supply chains, or significant increases in the prices of raw materials.Our manufacturing operations depend on securing raw materials and other supplies in adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner from multiple suppliers, and in some cases we rely on a limited number of suppliers, particularly in Asia. Accordingly, there may be cases where supplies of raw materials and other products are interrupted by disaster, accident or some other event at a supplier, supply is suspended due to quality or other issues, or there is a shortage of supply due to a rapid increase in demand, which could impact production and prevent us from supplying products to our customers. If the supply-demand balance is disrupted, it may considerably increase costs of manufacturing due to increased prices we pay for raw materials or fuel. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Further, it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another. A failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations. 27Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production, and as a result we may not be able to deliver products or do so in a timely, cost-effective or competitive manner. Further, to remain competitive and/or meet customer demand, we may be required to improve our facilities and process technologies and carry out extensive research and development, each of which may require investment of significant amounts of capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.The continued and future success of our licensing programs can be impacted by the deployment of other technologies in place of technologies based on CDMA, OFDMA and their derivatives; the success of our licensing programs for 4G single mode products and emerging industry segments; and the need to extend license agreements that are expiring and/or to cover additional future patents.Although we own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to OFDM, OFDMA, WLAN and other technologies, our patent portfolio licensing program in some of these areas may be less established and might not be as successful in generating licensing revenues as our CDMA licensing program has been. Many wireless operators have selected or have deployed OFDMA-based LTE as their next-generation 4G technology in existing (or future if not yet deployed) wireless spectrum bands as complementary to their existing CDMA-based networks. While 3G/4G multimode products are generally covered by our existing 3G licensing agreements, products that implement 4G but do not also implement 3G are generally not covered by these agreements. We believe that our patented technologies are essential and useful to implementation of the LTE industry standards and have granted royalty-bearing 4G single-mode licenses to the majority of the leading handset and other wireless device companies (including Huawei, LG, Microsoft, Oppo, Samsung, Sony Mobile, vivo, Xiaomi and ZTE) as they recognize that they need a license to our patents to make and sell products implementing 4G standards but not implementing 3G standards. The royalty rates for single mode 4G products are lower than our royalty rates for 3G and 3G/4G multimode products. Accordingly, without a corresponding increase in volumes and/or device ASP, we will not achieve the same licensing revenues on such LTE products as on 3G and 3G/4G multimode products. In addition, new connectivity and other services are emerging that rely on devices that may or may not be used on traditional cellular networks, such as devices used in the IoT and automotive industry segments. We also seek to diversify and broaden our technology licensing programs to new industry segments in which we can utilize our technology leadership, such as wireless charging and other technologies. Standards, even de facto standards, that develop as these technologies mature, in particular those that do not include a base level of interoperability, may impact our ability to obtain royalties at all or that are equivalent to those that we receive for 3G and 3G/4G multimode products used in cellular communications. Although we believe that our patented technologies are essential and useful to the commercialization of such services, any royalties we receive may be lower than those we receive from our current licensing program.Over the long-term, we need to continue to evolve our patent portfolio, particularly in 5G. If we do not maintain a strong portfolio that is applicable to current and/or future standards (such as 5G), products and/or services, our future licensing revenues could be negatively impacted.The licenses granted to and from us under a number of our license agreements include only patents that are either filed or issued prior to a certain date. As a result, there are agreements with some licensees where later patents are not licensed by or to us. Additionally, certain of our license agreements (including essentially all of our recent agreements in China) are effective for a specified term. In order to license or to obtain a license to such later patents or after the expiration of a specified term, or to receive royalties after the specified time period, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. Accordingly, to the extent not renewed on their terms or by election for an additional (generally multi-year) period, if applicable, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees more frequently than we have done historically. We might not be able to renew those license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, in the future without affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees, and such modifications or new agreements may negatively impact our revenues. If there is a delay in renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize revenues related to that licensee’s product sales. Further, if we are unable to reach agreement on such modifications or new agreements, it could result in patent infringement litigation with such companies.We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide technology leadership, supply assurance and low cost, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations. Our QCT segment primarily utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Other than the manufacturing facilities we now operate through our recently formed RF360 Holdings joint venture, we rely on independent third-party suppliers to 28perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Under the turnkey model, our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party suppliers for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and the majority of our final test requirements. The semiconductor manufacturing foundries that supply products to our QCT segment are primarily located in Asia, as are our primary warehouses where we store finished goods for fulfillment of customer orders. The following could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands and/or negatively impact our revenues, business operations, profitability and/or cash flows:•a reduction, interruption, delay or limitation in our product supply sources;•a failure by our suppliers to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our products;•our suppliers’ inability to react to shifts in product demand or an increase in raw material or component prices;•our suppliers’ delay in developing leading process technologies, or inability to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies;•the loss of a supplier or the inability of a supplier to meet performance, quality or yield specifications or delivery schedules; •additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier; and/or•natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts, particularly in Asia, impacting our suppliers.While we have established alternate suppliers for certain technologies, we rely on sole- or limited-source suppliers for certain products, subjecting us to significant risks, including: possible shortages of raw materials or manufacturing capacity; poor product performance; and reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing capability and yields, quality assurance, quantity and costs. To the extent we have established alternate suppliers, these suppliers may require significant levels of support to bring complex technologies to production. As a result, we may invest a significant amount of effort and resources and incur higher costs to support and maintain such alternate suppliers. Further, any future consolidation of foundry suppliers could increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and reduce our suppliers’ willingness to negotiate pricing, which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reductions and/or increase our manufacturing costs. Our arrangements with our suppliers may obligate us to incur costs to manufacture and test our products that do not decrease at the same rate as decreases in pricing to our customers. Our ability, and that of our suppliers, to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies, and to effectively compete with the manufacturing processes and performance of our competitors, could impact our ability to introduce new products and meet customer demand, could increase our costs (possibly decreasing our margins) and could subject us to the risk of excess inventories. Our inability to meet customer demand due to sole- or limited-sourcing and/or the additional costs that we incur because of these or other supply constraints or because of the need to support alternate suppliers could negatively impact our business, our results of operations and/or cash flows.Although we have long-term contracts with our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific quantity, our suppliers may allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the production and testing of products for their other customers while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture or test our products. Accordingly, capacity for our products may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. To the extent we do obtain long-term capacity commitments, we may incur additional costs related to those commitments and/or make non-refundable payments for capacity commitments that are not used.One or more of our suppliers or potential alternate suppliers may manufacture CDMA- or OFDMA-based integrated circuits that compete with our products. Such suppliers could elect to allocate raw materials and manufacturing capacity to their own products and reduce or limit deliveries to us to our detriment. In addition, we may not receive reasonable pricing, manufacturing or delivery terms from our suppliers. We cannot guarantee that the actions of our suppliers will not cause disruptions in our operations that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers or increase our cost of sales. 29Additionally, we place orders with our suppliers using our forecasts of customer demand, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates, and are generally only partially covered by commitments from our customers. If we overestimate customer demand, we may experience increased excess and/or obsolete inventory, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business.From time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights against our products or products using our technologies or other technologies used in our industry. These claims have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such litigation given, among other factors, the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products or services were found to infringe another company’s intellectual property rights, we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our products or services, which could be costly, or to license such rights and/or pay damages or other compensation to such other company. If we are unable to redesign our products or services, license such intellectual property rights used in our products or services or otherwise distribute our products (e.g., through a licensed supplier), we could be prohibited from making and selling such products or providing such services. In any potential dispute involving other companies’ patents or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and/or damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products or services sold or provided by us, or by intellectual property provided by us to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and/or cash flows. Furthermore, any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could hurt our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales and/or reductions in our licensees’ sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset and/or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delays, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.We expect that we may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (and/or on the sale of our customers’ devices using such products) and/or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our chipset customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our worldwide chipset sales and/or a reduction in our licensees’ sales to wireless operators, causing corresponding declines in our chipset and/or licensing revenues.Certain legal matters, including certain claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property, are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We may engage in strategic acquisitions, transactions or make investments that could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.We engage in strategic acquisitions and other transactions, including joint ventures, and make investments, which we believe are important to the future of our business, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. We acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology, wireless spectrum and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions and purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services) for voice and data communications and new industry segments. Recent material transactions include our acquisition of CSR plc, our RF360 Holdings joint venture with TDK Corporation and our proposed acquisition of NXP. Many of our strategic activities entail a high degree of risk and require the use of domestic and/or foreign capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies, products or services. We may underestimate the costs and/or 30overestimate the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership interests. In addition, we may record impairment charges related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited. Achieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions, including joint ventures and other strategic investments in which we have management and operational control, depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, technology, products, processes, operations (including manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers and suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development and/or supply operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not derive any commercial value from associated technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these technologies, and we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain, and we may become subject to litigation. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sales or distribution channels, business or operational models (including manufacturing), geographic regions, industry segments and/or categories of products served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of the combination. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions or other strategic activities, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transactions.We are subject to various laws, regulations, policies and standards. Our business may suffer as a result of existing, or new or amended, laws, regulations, policies or standards and/or our failure or inability to comply with laws, regulations, policies or standards.Our business, products and services, and those of our customers and licensees, are subject to various laws and regulations globally, as well as government policies and the specifications of international, national and regional communications standards bodies. Compliance with existing laws, regulations, policies and standards, the adoption of new laws, regulations, policies or standards, changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, policies or standards, changes in the regulation of our activities by a government or standards body and/or rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such laws, regulations, policies or standards, including, among others, those affecting licensing practices, competitive business practices, the use of our technology or products, protection of intellectual property, trade, foreign currency, investments or loans, spectrum availability and license issuance, adoption of standards, the provision of device subsidies by wireless operators to their customers, taxation, export control, privacy and data protection, environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, human rights, corporate governance, public disclosure or business conduct could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Government policies, particularly in China, that restrict the timing of funds that may flow out of a country may impact the timing of our receipt of payments from our customers and/or licensees in such country, which may negatively impact our cash flows.Delays in government approvals or other governmental activities that could result from, among others, a decrease in or a lack of funding for certain agencies or branches of the government and/or political changes, could result in our incurring higher costs, could negatively impact our ability to timely consummate strategic transactions and/or could have other negative impacts on our business and the businesses of our customers and licensees.National, state and local environmental laws and regulations affect our operations around the world. These laws may make it more expensive to manufacture, have manufactured and sell products, and our costs could increase if our vendors (e.g., suppliers, third-party manufacturers or utility companies) pass on their costs to us. We are also subject to laws and regulations impacting the manufacturing operations we acquired through our RF360 Holdings joint venture. See the Risk Factor entitled “There are numerous risks associated with our operation and control of manufacturing facilities we acquired through the formation of our joint venture with TDK, RF360 Holdings, including high fixed costs, environmental compliance and liability, exposure to natural disasters, timely supply of equipment and materials and manufacturing difficulties.”Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country (collectively, the Covered 31Countries), or were from recycled or scrap sources. Other countries or regions may impose similar requirements in the future. The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to determine that the conflict minerals used in our products do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Covered Countries, we may face challenges with our customers that place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. Similarly, other laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that require additional transparency regarding the employment practices of our suppliers, and any failure to maintain responsible sourcing practices could also adversely affect our relationships with customers and our reputation.Laws, regulations, policies and standards are complex and changing and may create uncertainty regarding compliance. Laws, regulations, policies and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases, and their application in practice may evolve over time. As a result, our efforts to comply may fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. Failure to comply with any law, regulation, policy or standard may adversely affect our business, results of operations and/or cash flows. New laws, regulations, policies and standards or evolving interpretations of legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and/or procedures and may divert management time and attention to compliance activities.Our use of open source software may harm our business.Certain of our software and our suppliers’ software may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, and we have seen, and believe we will continue to see, an increase in customers requesting that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. Also, our use and our customers’ use of open source software may subject our products and our customers’ products to governmental scrutiny and delays in product certification, which could cause customers to view our products as less desirable than our competitors’ products. While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property rights, our use of open source software presents risks that could have an adverse effect on these rights and on our business.Our stock price, earnings and the fair value of our investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market downturns.Our stock price and earnings have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock and/or earnings include those identified throughout this Risk Factors section, volatility of the stock market in general and technology-based companies in particular, announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers or licensees and variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors, among others. Further, increased volatility in the financial markets and/or overall economic conditions may reduce the amounts that we realize in the future on our cash equivalents and/or marketable securities and may reduce our earnings as a result of any impairment charges that we record to reduce recorded values of marketable securities to their fair values.In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. Due to changes in our stock price, we are and may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s attention and our resources. Certain legal matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”We maintain an extensive investment portfolio of varied holdings, which are generally classified as available-for-sale and are therefore recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at fair value, with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The fair values of our investments are subject to fluctuation based primarily on market price volatility, as well as the underlying operations of the associated investment, among other things. If the fair value of such investments decreases below their cost basis, as some of our previous investments have, we may be required in certain circumstances to recognize a loss in our results of operations. The sensitivity of and risks associated with 32the market value of our investment portfolio are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Part II, Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.” There are risks associated with our indebtedness.Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur, including in connection with our proposed acquisition of NXP, may have negative consequences on our business, including, among others:•requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends or other general corporate and other purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and/or•increasing our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations to the extent a portion of our debt has variable interest rates.Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, including factors which negatively impact our cash flows, such as licensees withholding some or all of the royalty payments they owe to us or paying fines in connection with regulatory investigations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things: repatriate funds to the United States at substantial tax cost; refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing and/or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such refinancing and/or restructuring would increase. If there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt in the future and/or the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches or other misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary or confidential information.Attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems are increasingly more sophisticated. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, include covertly introducing malware to our computers and networks, including those in our manufacturing operations, and impersonating authorized users, among others. In addition, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, customers or licensees, may misappropriate, use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers or licensees our intellectual property and/or proprietary or confidential business information. We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The theft, unauthorized use or publication of our intellectual property and/or proprietary or confidential business information could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives and/or otherwise adversely affect our business. To the extent any security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our customers’ or licensees’ proprietary or confidential information, we may incur liability. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our information technology systems.Potential tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Singapore where our QCT segment’s non-United States headquarters is located. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly are subject to examination of our tax returns and reports by taxing authorities in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, most notably in countries where we earn a routine return and the tax authorities believe substantial value-add activities are performed. Our current examinations are at various stages with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts give rise to a revision become known. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable at September 24, 2017, the final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In such case, our income tax provision, results of operations and/or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made could be negatively affected.We have tax incentives in Singapore provided that we meet specified employment and other criteria, and as a result of the expiration of these incentives, our Singapore tax rate increased in fiscal 2017 and is expected to increase again in fiscal 332027. If we do not meet the criteria required to retain such incentives, our Singapore tax rate could increase prior to fiscal 2027, and our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.Tax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business. For example, we consider the operating earnings of certain non-United States subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested outside the United States based on our current needs for those earnings to be reinvested offshore as well as estimates that future domestic cash generated from operations and/or borrowings will be sufficient to meet future domestic cash needs for the foreseeable future. No provision has been made for United States federal, state or foreign taxes that may result from future remittances of the undistributed earnings of these foreign subsidiaries. Our future results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected if tax rules regarding unrepatriated earnings change, if domestic cash needs require us to repatriate foreign earnings, if the shares of these foreign subsidiaries were sold or otherwise transferred or if the United States international tax rules change as part of comprehensive tax reform or other tax legislation. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to transfer pricing. These changes, if adopted by countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow. We have not yet determined what changes, if any, may be needed to our operations or structure to address BEPS. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the United States or Singapore, our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition could be adversely affected.Global, regional or local economic conditions that impact the mobile communications industry or the other industries in which we operate could negatively affect the demand for our products and services and our customers’ or licensees’ products and services, which may negatively affect our revenues.A decline in global, regional or local economic conditions or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or licensees, could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on demand for our products and for the products and services of our customers or licensees, particularly equipment manufacturers or others in the wireless communications industry who buy their products, such as wireless operators. Any prolonged economic downturn may result in a decrease in demand for our products or technologies; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting and/or payments from our licensees and/or customers; failures by counterparties; and negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers’ ability to purchase or pay for our products and services and network operators’ ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be adversely affected by economic conditions, leading to a reduction, cancelation or delay of orders for our products or services.We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenues, harm our ability to collect receivables or increase the U.S. dollar cost of our products.Our customers sell their products throughout the world in various currencies. Our consolidated revenues from international customers and licensees as a percentage of our total revenues were greater than 90% in each of the last three fiscal years. Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business, revenues, results of operations and/or cash flows due to a number of factors, including, among others:•Our products and those of our customers and licensees that are sold outside the United States may become less price-competitive, which may result in reduced demand for those products and/or downward pressure on average selling prices;•Certain of our revenues, such as royalties, that are derived from licensee or customer sales denominated in foreign currencies could decrease; 34•Our foreign suppliers may raise their prices if they are impacted by currency fluctuations, resulting in higher than expected costs and lower margins; •Certain of our costs that are derived from supply contracts denominated in foreign currencies could increase; and/or•Foreign exchange hedging transactions that we engage in to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations may require the payment of structuring fees, limit the U.S. dollar value of royalties from licensees’ sales that are denominated in foreign currencies, cause earnings volatility if the hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting and expose us to counterparty risk if the counterparty fails to perform.Failures in our products or services or in the products or services of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.The use of devices containing our products to access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system software in those devices to viral or malicious attacks. While we continue to focus on this issue and are taking measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities continue to evolve, enabling more data and processes, such as computing, and increasing the risk of security failures. Further, our products are inherently complex and may contain defects or errors that are detected only when the products are in use. The design process interface in new domains of technology and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes are complex and add risk to manufacturing yields and reliability. Further, manufacturing, testing, marketing and use of our products and those of our customers and licensees entail the risk of product liability. Because our products and services are responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products and/or networks, security failures, defects or errors in our products or services could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and/or on the end users of our customers’ products. Such adverse impact could include product liability claims or recalls, write-offs of our inventories, property, plant and equipment and/or intangible assets; unfavorable purchase commitments; a shift of business to our competitors; a decrease in demand for connected devices and wireless services; damage to our reputation and to our customer relationships; and other financial liability or harm to our business. Further, security failures, defects or errors in the products of our customers or licensees could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and/or cash flows due to a delay or decrease in demand for our products or services generally, and our premium-tier products in particular, among other factors. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2.

Additionally, our QCT segment’s non-United States headquarters is located in Singapore. Our consolidated RF360 Holdings joint venture with TDK leases manufacturing facilities in Germany, China and Singapore. We also own and lease properties around the world for use as sales and administrative offices and research and development centers, primarily in the United States and India. Our facility leases expire at varying dates through 2025, not including renewals that would be at our option. Several other owned and leased facilities are under construction totaling approximately 128,000 additional square feet.We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and that the productive capacity in facilities that are not under construction is substantially utilized. We do not identify or allocate facilities by operating segment. Additional information on net property, plant and equipment by geography is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.” In the future, we may need to purchase, build or lease additional facilities to meet the requirements projected in our long-term business plan. 35Item 3. Legal and Regulatory ProceedingsInformation regarding legal and regulatory proceedings is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIn addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report.The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in “Part II,",2023-12-30 18:21:52.161440
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2018,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the “Our Business and Operating Segments” section under the heading “Seasonality.”Restructuring PlansIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced a Cost Plan designed to align our cost structure to our long-term margin targets. As part of this plan, we have initiated and continue to execute on a series of targeted actions across our businesses to reduce annual costs by $1 billion, excluding incremental costs resulting from any future acquisition of a business. We expect these cost reductions to be fully captured in fiscal 2019. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we announced a Strategic Realignment Plan designed to improve execution, enhance financial performance and drive profitable growth as we worked to create sustainable long-term value for stockholders. As part of this, among other actions, we implemented a cost reduction plan, which included a series of targeted reductions across our businesses, particularly in QCT, and a reduction to our annual share-based compensation grants. Restructuring activities were initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, and the cost reduction initiatives were achieved by the end of fiscal 2016 and other activities under the plan were completed by the end of fiscal 2017. Additional information regarding our Cost Plan and Strategic Realignment Plan is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10. Restructuring Plans.”Corporate StructureWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operations and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by QUALCOMM Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.Revenue Concentrations and Significant CustomersRevenues in fiscal 2018 and 2017 were negatively impacted by our continued dispute with Apple Inc. and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd./Foxconn, its affiliates and other suppliers to Apple. We did not record any revenues in fiscal 2018 or the third or fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 for royalties due on sales of Apple’s products.A small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2018, revenues from Samsung Electronics, Xiaomi Corporation and suppliers to Apple Inc. each comprised more than 10% of consolidated revenues. Combined revenues from GuangDong OPPO Mobile Telecommunications Corp. Ltd. and vivo Communication Technology Co., Ltd., and their respective affiliates, also comprised more than 10% of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2018 and 2017. In fiscal 2017 and 2016, revenues from Samsung Electronics and suppliers to Apple Inc. each comprised more than 10% of consolidated revenues. 14Research and DevelopmentThe communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in CDMA, OFDMA and a broad range of other technologies. Using these engineering resources, we expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products, and to leverage that research and development in adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries (such as automotive, IoT and networking), including continuing the development of CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies (such as RFFE), developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies, and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world. Our research and development team has a demonstrated track record of innovation in voice and data communication technologies and application processor technology, among others.We continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in 4G OFDMA-based technologies (including LTE) and 5G OFDMA-based technologies. We also engage in acquisitions and other transactions, such as joint ventures, to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or open or expand opportunities for our technologies and to support the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products and services) for voice and data communications and new industry segments outside of the traditional cellular industry. Our most recent significant transaction was our RF360 Holdings joint venture with TDK Corporation. We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets and laptops), consumer electronics and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G and 4G LTE technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, GPS, GLONASS, BeiDou, Galileo and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other mobile client software environments in our chipsets.We develop on our own, and with our partners, innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition.We have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world that support our global development activities and ongoing efforts to develop and/or advance 4G, 5G and a broad range of other technologies. We continue to use our substantial engineering resources and expertise to develop new technologies, applications and services and make them available to licensees to help grow the communications industry and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities.We also make investments in opportunities that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and enter into adjacent industry segments, such as products for automotive, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics), networking, computing and AI, such as machine learning, among others.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing activities of our operating segments are discussed under Operating Segments. Other marketing activities include public relations, advertising, digital marketing and social media, participation in technical conferences and trade shows, development of business cases and white papers, competitive analyses, industry intelligence and other marketing programs, such as marketing development funds with our customers. Our Corporate Marketing department provides company information on our Internet site and through other channels regarding our products, strategies and technology to industry analysts and media.CompetitionCompetition faced by our operating segments is discussed under Operating Segments. Competition in the communications industry throughout the world continues to increase at a rapid pace as consumers, businesses and governments realize the potential of wireless communications products and services. We have facilitated competition in the wireless communications industry by licensing our technologies to a large number of manufacturers. Although we have attained a significant position in the traditional cellular industry, many of our current and potential competitors may have 15advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products, to use our competitors’ integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, including by bundling with other products, or to choose alternative technologies; lower cost structures and/or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices and lower or negative margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies or competitors; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and original equipment manufacturers in certain geographic regions (such as China) and/or experience in adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries (such as automotive and IoT); and/or a more established presence in certain regions. These relationships may affect customers’ decisions to purchase products or license technology from us. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market positions to our detriment.We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings and introduce new technologies and services in the future and as additional companies compete with our products or services based on 3G, 4G, 5G or other technologies. Although we intend to continue to make substantial investments in developing new products and technologies and improving existing products and technologies, our competitors may introduce alternative products, services or technologies that threaten our business. It is also possible that the prices we charge for our products and services may continue to decline as competition continues to intensify.

Risk FactorsYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business and results of operations and require significant management time and attention. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Risks Related to Our BusinessesOur revenues depend on commercial network deployments, expansions and upgrades of CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, including 5G; our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on these technologies; and customers’ demand for our products and services.We develop, patent and commercialize technology and products based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, which are primarily wireless. We depend on operators of wireless networks and our customers and licensees to adopt and/or implement the latest generation of these technologies for use in their networks, devices and services. We also depend on our customers and licensees to develop devices and services based on these technologies with value-added features to drive consumer demand for new 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multi-mode devices, as well as 3G, 4G and 5G single-mode devices, as well as to establish the selling prices for such devices. Further, we depend on the timing of our customers’ and licensees’ deployments of new devices and services based on these technologies. Increasingly, we also depend on operators of wireless networks, our customers and licensees and other third parties to incorporate these technologies into new device types and into industries and applications beyond traditional cellular communications, such as automotive, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics), networking, computing and artificial intelligence (AI), such as machine learning, among others. We have historically been successful during wireless technology transitions. The next generation of wireless technologies is 5G, which we expect will empower a new era of connected devices and will be utilized not only in handsets but in new device types, industries and applications beyond traditional cellular communications, as described above (see also Part I, Item 1, “Business” for a further description of 5G). We expect initial commercial deployments of 5G devices to begin in calendar 2019. We believe it is important that we be a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and develop, commercialize and be a leading supplier of 5G integrated circuit products and services in order to sustain and grow our business long-term.Our revenues and/or growth in revenues could be negatively impacted, our business may be harmed and our substantial investments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return, if:•wireless operators and industries beyond traditional cellular communications deploy alternative technologies;•wireless operators delay next-generation network deployments, particularly 5G, expansions or upgrades and/or delay moving 2G customers to 3G, 3G/4G multi-mode, 4G or 5G wireless devices;•LTE, an OFDMA-based wireless technology, is not more widely deployed or further commercial deployment is delayed;•government regulators delay making sufficient spectrum available for 3G, 4G and 5G wireless technologies, including unlicensed spectrum and shared spectrum technologies, thereby restricting the ability of wireless operators to deploy or expand the use of these technologies;•wireless operators delay or do not drive improvements in 3G, 4G or 3G/4G multi-mode network performance and/or capacity; 18•our customers’ and licensees’ revenues and sales of products, particularly premium-tier products, and services using these technologies, and average selling prices (ASPs) of such products, decline, do not grow or do not grow as anticipated due to, for example, the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed regions;•our intellectual property and technical leadership included in the 5G standardization effort is different than in 3G and 4G standards;•the standardization and/or deployment of 5G technologies is delayed; •we are unable to drive the adoption of our products and services into networks and devices, including devices beyond traditional cellular applications, based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies; and/or•consumers’ rates of replacement of smartphones and other computing devices decline, do not grow or do not grow as quickly as anticipated.Our industry is subject to competition in an environment of rapid technological change that could result in decreased demand and/or declining average selling prices for our products and/or those of our customers and/or licensees.Our products, services and technologies face significant competition. We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to attract new business and/or customers, as new opportunities develop, and as new competitors enter the industry. Competition in wireless communications is affected by various factors that include, among others: device manufacturer concentrations; vertical integration; growth in demand, consumption and competition in certain geographic regions; government intervention and/or support of national industries and/or competitors; evolving industry standards and business models; evolving methods of transmission of voice and data communications; increasing data traffic and densification of wireless networks; convergence and aggregation of connectivity technologies (including Wi-Fi and LTE) in both devices and access points; consolidation of wireless technologies and infrastructure at the network edge; networking and connectivity trends (including cloud services); use of licensed, shared and unlicensed spectrum; the evolving nature of computing (including demand for always on, always connected capabilities); the speed of technological change (including the transition to smaller geometry process technologies); value-added features that drive selling prices as well as consumer demand for new 3G, 3G/4G multi-mode, 4G and 5G devices; turnkey, integrated products that incorporate hardware, software, user interface, applications and reference designs; scalability; and the ability of the system technology to meet customers’ immediate and future network requirements. We anticipate that additional competitors will introduce products as a result of growth opportunities in wireless communications, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, technological and public policy changes and relatively low barriers to entry in certain segments of the industry. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape.We expect that our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:•differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features (e.g., modem, radio frequency front-end (RFFE), graphics and/or other processors, camera and connectivity) and with smaller geometry process technologies that drive performance;•develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points to effectively cover both emerging and developed geographic regions and all device tiers;•drive the adoption of our integrated circuit products into the most popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and other computing devices, automobiles, wearables and voice and music and other connected devices and infrastructure products;•maintain and/or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit products at the premium device tier, while increasing the adoption of our products in mid- and low-tier devices, in part by strengthening our integrated circuit product roadmap for, and developing channel relationships in, emerging regions, such as China and India, and by providing turnkey products, which incorporate our integrated circuits, for low- and mid-tier smartphones, tablets and laptops;•continue to be a leader in 4G and 5G technology evolution, including expansion of our LTE-based single-mode licensing program in areas where single-mode products are commercialized, and continue to innovate and introduce 4G and 5G turnkey, integrated products and services that differentiate us from our competition;•be a leader serving original equipment manufacturers, high level operating systems (HLOS) providers, operators, cloud providers and other industry participants as competitors, new industry entrants and other factors continue to affect the industry landscape; 19•be a preferred partner (and sustain preferred relationships) providing integrated circuit products that support multiple operating system and infrastructure platforms to industry participants that effectively commercialize new devices using these platforms;•increase and/or accelerate demand for our semiconductor component products, including RFFE, and our wired and wireless connectivity products, including networking products for consumers, carriers and enterprise equipment and connected devices;•identify potential acquisition targets that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic needs, reach agreement on terms acceptable to us, close the transactions and effectively integrate these new businesses and/or technologies;•create standalone value and/or contribute to the success of our existing businesses through acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions (and/or by developing customer, licensee, vendor, distributor and/or other channel relationships) in new industry segments and/or disruptive technologies, products and/or services (such as products for automotive, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics), networking, computing and AI, such as machine learning, among others); •become a leading supplier of RFFE products, which are designed to address cellular radio frequency band fragmentation while improving radio frequency performance and assist original equipment manufacturers in developing multiband, multi-mode mobile devices; •be a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing and develop, commercialize and be a leading supplier of 5G integrated circuit products and services; and/or•continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in computing and other consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging regions.Competition in any or all product tiers may result in the loss of certain business or customers, which would negatively impact our revenues, results of operations and cash flows. Such competition may also reduce average selling prices for our chipset products and/or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging regions where competitors may have lower cost structures and/or may have a willingness and ability to accept lower prices and/or lower or negative margins on their products (particularly in China). Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees’ products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.We compete with many different semiconductor companies, ranging from multinational companies with integrated research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing organizations across a broad spectrum of product lines, to companies that are focused on a single application market segment or standard product, including those that produce products for automotive, IoT and networking applications. Most of these competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our businesses. Companies that promote standards that are neither CDMA- nor OFDMA-based (e.g., GSM) as well as companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Advanced Micro Devices, Inc., Broadcom Limited, Cirrus Logic, Cypress Semiconductor Corporation, HiSilicon Technologies, Intel, Marvell Technology, Maxim Integrated Products, MediaTek, Microchip Technology Inc., Murata Manufacturing Co., Ltd., Nordic Semiconductor, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors N.V., Qorvo Inc., Realtek Semiconductor, Renesas Electronics Corporation, Samsung Electronics, Sequans Communications S.A., Skyworks Solutions Inc. and Spreadtrum Communications (which is controlled by Tsinghua Unigroup). Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products, to use our competitors’ integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, including by bundling with other products, or to choose alternative technologies; lower cost structures and/or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices and lower or negative margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies or competitors; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and original equipment manufacturers in certain geographic regions (such as China) and/or experience in adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries (such as automotive and IoT); and/or a more established presence in certain regions. 20We derive a significant portion of our consolidated revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, which increasingly includes a small number of Chinese OEMs. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.Our QCT segment derives a significant portion of its revenues from a small number of customers, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Chinese OEMs continue to grow their device share in China and are increasing their device share in regions outside of China, and we derive a significant and increasing portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs. In addition, certain of our largest integrated circuit customers develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past chosen to utilize in certain of their devices, and may in the future choose to utilize in certain (or all) of their devices, rather than our products (and/or sell their integrated circuit products to third parties in competition with us). Also, Apple, which has historically been one of our largest customers, now utilizes products of one of our competitors in many of their devices rather than our products, is solely utilizing one or more or our competitor’s products in its next smartphone launch, and may continue to use our competitors’ products rather than our products in the future.The loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by such customers or the cancelation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products, our competitors’ integrated circuit products or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations, and a delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development. Further, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers’ new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and/or success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate. Accordingly, if current industry dynamics and concentrations continue, our QCT segment’s revenues will continue to depend largely upon, and be impacted by, future purchases, and the timing and size of any such future purchases, by these significant customers.Further, Apple purchases our Mobile Data Modem (MDM) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. To the extent Apple takes device share from our other customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted. Further, companies that develop HLOS for devices, including leading technology companies, now sell their own devices. If we fail to effectively partner or continue partnering with these companies, or with their partners or customers, they may decide not to purchase (either directly or through their contract manufacturers), or to reduce or discontinue their purchases of, our integrated circuit products.In addition, there has been and continues to be litigation among certain of our customers and other industry participants, and the potential outcomes of such litigation, including but not limited to injunctions against devices that incorporate our products and/or intellectual property, or rulings on certain patent law or patent licensing issues that create new legal precedent, could impact our business, particularly if such action impacts one of our larger customers.Although we have more than 300 licensees, our QTL segment derives a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of licensees, which increasingly includes a small number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and/or payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of such license agreements, including standard-essential patent only license agreements, under similar terms, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We have no control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees, without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues. Such adverse impact may be muted by the per unit royalty caps that apply to certain categories of complete wireless devices, namely smartphones, tablets and laptops.We derive a significant portion of our consolidated revenues from the premium-tier device segment. If sales of premium-tier devices decrease, and/or sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products decrease, our results of operations could be negatively affected. 21We derive a significant portion of our revenues from the premium-tier device segment, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, lengthening replacement cycles in developed regions, where premium-tier smartphones are common; increasing consumer demand in emerging regions, particularly China and India, where premium-tier smartphones are less common and replacement cycles are on average longer than in developed regions and are continuing to lengthen; and/or a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and/or innovation cycles. In addition, as discussed in the prior risk factor, our industry is experiencing concentration of device share among a few companies at the premium tier, which gives them significant supply chain leverage. Further, those companies may utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products, or our competitors’ integrated circuit products, rather than our products in all or a portion of their devices. These dynamics may result in lower prices for and/or reduced sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products.A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, or a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), may reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.Efforts by some communications equipment manufacturers or their customers to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions and/or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.From time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to renegotiate, mitigate and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity and/or unenforceability of our patents and/or licenses, that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and other organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, of seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing and/or of weakening a patent holder’s ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) licensees using various strategies to attempt to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers that results in lowering the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price on which the royalty is calculated. In addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported and/or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and licensees and/or companies may continue to do so in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report and/or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and/or companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment and/or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows will be exacerbated.We are currently subject to various litigation and governmental investigations and/or proceedings, some of which have arisen and may continue to arise out of the strategies described above. Certain legal matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Depending on the type of matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices, such as requiring us to reduce our royalty rates, reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers and/or modify or renegotiate our existing license agreements, and/or determinations that all or portions of our license agreements are invalid or unenforceable. In addition, decisions or orders arising out of governmental investigations or proceedings could require us to renegotiate, or could encourage or embolden our licensees to demand to renegotiate, their license agreements with us (which could be on terms that are less favorable to us than existing terms), and such licensees may underreport, underpay, not report 22or not pay royalties owed to us pending the conclusion of such negotiations. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. See also the Risk Factor entitled “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, private legal proceedings challenging those practices or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.”In addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments. Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our patent portfolio.Further, some companies or entities have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and/or have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by severely limiting the base upon which the royalty percentage may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (and/or other companies’) alleged failure to abide by these policies.Some SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted and may in the future adopt some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party.We expect that such proposals, interpretations and strategies will continue in the future, and if successful, our business model would be harmed, either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalties (or by reducing the royalties we can collect) on all or a portion of our patent portfolio, limiting our return on investment with respect to new technologies, limiting our ability to seek injunctions against infringers of our standard-essential patents, constraining our ability to make licensing commitments when submitting our technology for inclusion in future standards (which could make our technology less likely to be included in such standards) or forcing us to work outside of SDOs or other industry groups to promote our new technologies, and our revenues, results of operations and/or cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, the legal and other costs associated with asserting or defending our positions have been and continue to be significant. We assume that such challenges, regardless of their merits, will continue into the foreseeable future and will require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources.Our business, particularly our licensing business, may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or proceedings.We are currently subject to various governmental investigations and/or proceedings, particularly with respect to our licensing business, and certain such matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” Key allegations in those matters include, among others, that we do not license our cellular standard-essential patents separately from our other patents, that we violate FRAND licensing commitments by refusing to grant licenses to chipset makers, that our royalty rates are too high and/or that the base on which our royalties are calculated should be something less than the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of the applicable device (minus certain permitted deductions). The unfavorable resolution of one or more of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. Depending on the type of matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, injunctions, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, and/or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices, such as requiring us to reduce our royalty rates, reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers and/or modify or renegotiate our existing license agreements, and/or determinations that all or portions of our license agreements are invalid or unenforceable. In addition, decisions or orders arising out of such governmental investigations or proceedings could require us to renegotiate, or could encourage or embolden our licensees to demand to renegotiate, their license agreements with us (which could be on terms that are less favorable to us than existing terms), and such licensees may underreport, underpay, not report or not pay royalties owed to us pending the conclusion of such negotiations. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. See also the Risk Factor entitled 23“Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, private legal proceedings challenging those practices or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.”Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, private legal proceedings challenging those practices or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.We are currently subject to various governmental investigations and private legal proceedings challenging our patent licensing practices as described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” Key allegations in those matters include, among others, that we do not license our cellular standard-essential patents separately from our other patents, that we violate FRAND licensing commitments by refusing to grant licenses to chipset makers, that our royalty rates are too high and/or that the base on which our royalties are calculated should be something less than the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of the applicable device (minus certain permitted deductions). We believe that the ultimate intent of these investigations and legal proceedings is to reduce the amount of royalties that licensees are required to pay to us for their use of our intellectual property.We have historically licensed our cellular standard-essential patents together with our other patents that may be useful to licensed products because licensees typically have desired to obtain the commercial benefits of receiving such broad patent rights from us. However, we also have licensed only our cellular standard-essential patents to certain licensees who have requested such licenses. In addition, in connection with our resolution with the China National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), our standard practice in China since 2015 is to offer licenses to our 3G and 4G standard-essential Chinese patents for devices sold for use in China separately from our other patents. In addition, we offer licenses to only our cellular standard-essential patents (including 3G, 4G and 5G) for both single mode and multi-mode devices worldwide. A number of our licensees have entered into standard-essential patent only agreements on a worldwide basis, and we expect more of our licensees may do so in the future. Our royalty rates for licenses to only our cellular standard-essential patents are lower than our royalty rates for licenses to substantially all of our patent portfolio. If more licensees choose a license to only our cellular standard-essential patents instead of a portfolio license than has historically been the case, our licensing revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted unless we were able to license our other patents at rates that offset all or a portion of any difference between the royalties previously received for licenses of substantially all of our patent portfolio as compared to licenses of only our cellular standard-essential patents and/or there was a sufficient increase in the overall volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid.If we were required to grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers (i.e., to implement a more complex, tiered licensing structure in which we license certain portions of our patent portfolio to chipset manufacturers and other portions to device manufacturers), we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, and we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed. In addition, our licensing revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain, in the aggregate, equivalent revenues under such a multi-level licensing structure.If we were required to reduce the royalty rates we charge under our patent license agreements, our revenues, earnings and/or cash flows would be negatively impacted absent a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid. Similarly, if we were required to reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, our revenues, results of operations and/or cash flows would be negatively impacted unless there was a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid and/or we were able to increase our royalty rates to offset the decrease in revenues resulting from such lower royalty base (assuming the absolute royalty dollars were below any relevant royalty caps).To the extent that we were required to implement any of these new licensing practices by modifying or renegotiating our existing license agreements, we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, and we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed. The impact of any such changes to our licensing practices could vary widely and by jurisdiction, depending on the specific outcomes and the geographic scope of such outcomes. In addition, if we were required to make modifications to our licensing practices in one jurisdiction, licensees and/or governmental agencies in other jurisdictions may attempt to obtain similar outcomes for themselves and/or for such other jurisdictions, as applicable.The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and/or could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property rights and/or by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions. 24We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, international treaties and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and proprietary information is difficult and time consuming. The steps we have taken have not always prevented, and we cannot be certain the steps we will take in the future will prevent, the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary intellectual property rights as fully or as readily as U.S. laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective. Some industry participants who have a vested interest in devaluing patents in general, or standard-essential patents in particular, have mounted attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established patent laws. In the United States, there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law changes and current and potential future litigation regarding patents, the outcomes of which could be detrimental to our licensing business. The laws in certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including certain countries in Asia, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States. We expect that the European Union will adopt a unitary patent system in the next few years that may broadly impact that region’s patent regime. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any potential changes. In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of any standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in the future in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our products or technologies.We have had, and may in the future have, difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights and/or contracts, including collecting royalties for use of our patent portfolio due to, among others: refusal by certain licensees to report and/or pay all or a portion of the royalties they owe to us; policies of foreign governments; challenges to our licensing practices under competition laws; adoption of mandatory licensing provisions by foreign jurisdictions (either with controlled/regulated royalties or royalty free); failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce judgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and/or challenges before competition agencies to our licensing business and/or the pricing and integration of additional features and functionality into our chipset products. Certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported and/or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements for their use of our intellectual property, and such licensees and/or companies may continue to do so in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report and/or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or not enter into, new license agreements. Additionally, although our license agreements provide us with the right to audit the books and records of licensees, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. Further, certain licensees may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their books and records. To the extent we do not aggressively enforce our rights under our license agreements, licensees may not comply with their existing license agreements, and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed companies to enter into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, other unlicensed companies may not enter into license agreements. Similarly, we provide access to certain of our intellectual property and/or proprietary and/or confidential business information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees, who may wrongfully use such intellectual property and/or information and/or wrongfully disclose such intellectual property and/or information to third parties, including our competitors.We have entered into litigation and/or arbitration in the past and may need to further litigate and/or arbitrate in the future to enforce our contract and/or intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. We are currently engaged in litigation matters related to protecting or enforcing our contract and/or intellectual property rights, and certain such matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” As a result of any such litigation and/or arbitration, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable (which may in turn result in other licensees either not complying with their existing license agreements and/or initiating litigation) and/or we could incur substantial costs. Any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our results of operations and/or cash flows. Further, even a positive resolution to our enforcement efforts may take time to conclude, which may reduce our revenues and cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development, in the periods prior to conclusion. See also the Risk Factor entitled “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, private legal proceedings challenging those practices or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.”Our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our technologies, products and services into new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments and/or applications outside of traditional cellular 25industries, such as automotive, IoT and networking, among others. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas and industry segments, and related technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing technologies, products and services and new technologies, such as 5G, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, and we must make substantial research, development and other investments, such as acquisitions, in new products, services and technologies to compete successfully. Technological innovations generally require significant research and development efforts before they are commercially viable. While we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies, we also innovate across a broad spectrum of opportunities to deploy new and expanded products and enter into adjacent industry segments and/or applications by leveraging our existing technical and business expertise and/or through acquisitions.In particular, our future growth significantly depends on new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments and/or applications, such as automotive, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics), networking, computing and AI, such as machine learning, among others; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies, products and services for new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments; and third parties incorporating our technology, products and services into devices used in these product areas, industry segments and/or applications. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas, adjacent industry segments and/or applications, and in developing new products, services and technologies for these product areas, industry segments and/or applications. Our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop 5G technologies, and to develop and commercialize products using 5G technologies. However, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, adjacent industry segments and/or applications, and corresponding technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing, technologies, products and services and new technologies, such as 5G, use of licensed, shared and unlicensed spectrum, and convergence of cellular and Wi-Fi, may not succeed due to, among other reasons: new industry segments, applications and/or consumer demand may not develop and/or grow as anticipated; our strategies and/or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be successful; improvements in alternate technologies in ways that reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors’ technologies, products or services being more cost effective, having more capabilities or fewer limitations or being brought to market faster than our new technologies, products and services; and competitors having longer operating histories in industry segments that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of or overestimate the future revenues and/or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns. Further, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in a significant barrier to entry and increased costs.If our new technologies, products and/or services are not successful, or are not successful in the time frame we anticipate, we may incur significant costs and/or asset impairments, our business may not grow as anticipated, our revenues and/or margins may be negatively impacted, and/or our reputation may be harmed.There are numerous risks associated with our operation and control of the manufacturing facilities of our joint venture with TDK, RF360 Holdings, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model, environmental compliance and liability, exposure to natural disasters, timely supply of equipment and materials and manufacturing difficulties.Manufacturing facilities are characterized by a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model. In less favorable industry environments, in particular, we may be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products. During such periods, our manufacturing facilities could operate at lower capacity levels, while the fixed costs associated with full capacity continue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit.We are subject to many environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing facilities, which govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We cannot make assurances that we will be at all times in compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several, liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances. Certain of these laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous 26substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. In addition, we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.We have manufacturing facilities in Asia and Europe. If tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts were to damage, destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facilities, it could disrupt our operations, delay new production and shipments of inventory or result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs. In addition, natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts may result in disruptions in transportation, distribution channels or supply chains, or significant increases in the prices of raw materials.Our manufacturing operations depend on securing raw materials and other supplies in adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner from multiple suppliers, and in some cases, we rely on a limited number of suppliers, particularly in Asia. Accordingly, there may be cases where supplies of raw materials and other products are interrupted by disaster, accident or some other event at a supplier, supply is suspended due to quality or other issues, or there is a shortage of supply due to a rapid increase in demand, which could impact production and prevent us from supplying products to our customers. If the supply-demand balance is disrupted, it may considerably increase costs of manufacturing due to increased prices we pay for raw materials or fuel. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Additionally, supply of and/or costs of raw materials may be negatively impacted by trade protection policies, such as tariffs, and/or escalating trade tensions, particularly with countries in Asia. Further, it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another. A failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations.Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production, and as a result, we may not be able to deliver products or do so in a timely, cost-effective or competitive manner. Further, to remain competitive and/or meet customer demand, we may be required to improve our facilities and process technologies and carry out extensive research and development, each of which may require investment of significant amounts of capital, and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio, and our licensing programs may be impacted by the proliferation of devices in new industry segments such as automotive and IoT, as well as the need to extend license agreements that are expiring and/or to cover additional future patents.We own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G, 5G and other technologies. It is critical that we continue to evolve our patent portfolio, particularly in 5G. If we do not maintain a strong portfolio that is applicable to current and future standards, products and services, particularly 5G, our future licensing revenues could be negatively impacted. In addition, new connectivity and other services are emerging that rely on devices that may or may not be used on traditional cellular networks, such as devices used in the IoT and automotive industry segments. We also seek to diversify and broaden our technology licensing programs to new industry segments in which we can utilize our technology leadership. Standards, even de facto standards, that develop as these technologies mature, in particular those that do not include a base level of interoperability, may impact our ability to obtain royalties at all or that are equivalent to those that we receive for products used in cellular communications. Although we believe that our patented technologies are essential and useful to the commercialization of such services, any royalties we receive may be lower than those we receive from our current licensing program.Further, the licenses granted to and from us under a number of our license agreements include only patents that are either filed or issued prior to a certain date. As a result, there are agreements with some licensees where later patents are not licensed by or to us. Additionally, many of our license agreements (including essentially all of our agreements in China and our recent worldwide SEP only agreements) are effective for a specified term. In order to license or to obtain a license to such later patents or after the expiration of a specified term, or to receive royalties after the specified time period, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. Accordingly, to the extent not renewed on their terms or by election for an additional (generally multi-year) period, if applicable, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees more frequently than we have done historically. We might not be able to renew those license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, in the future without affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees, and such modifications or new agreements may negatively impact our revenues. If there is a delay in renewing a license agreement prior to its expiration, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize revenues related to that licensee’s product sales. 27Further, if we are unable to reach agreement on such modifications or new agreements, it could result in patent infringement litigation with such companies.We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide technology leadership, supply assurance and low cost, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations. Our QCT segment primarily utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Other than the manufacturing facilities we now operate through our RF360 Holdings joint venture, we rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Under the turnkey model, our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party suppliers for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and the majority of our final test requirements. The semiconductor manufacturing foundries that supply products to our QCT segment are primarily located in Asia, as are our primary warehouses where we store finished goods for fulfillment of customer orders. The following could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demands and/or negatively impact our revenues, business operations, profitability and/or cash flows:•a reduction, interruption, delay or limitation in our product supply sources;•a failure by our suppliers to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our products;•our suppliers’ inability to react to shifts in product demand or an increase in raw material or component prices;•our suppliers’ delay in developing leading process technologies, or inability to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies;•the loss of a supplier or the inability of a supplier to meet performance, quality or yield specifications or delivery schedules; •additional expense and/or production delays as a result of qualifying a new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of or a decision to add or change a supplier; and/or•natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts, particularly in Asia, impacting our suppliers.Additionally, supply of and/or costs of raw materials may be negatively impacted by trade protection policies, such as tariffs, and/or escalating trade tensions, particularly with countries in Asia. While we have established alternate suppliers for certain technologies, we rely on sole- or limited-source suppliers for certain products, subjecting us to significant risks, including: possible shortages of raw materials or manufacturing capacity; poor product performance; and reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing capability and yields, quality assurance, quantity and costs. To the extent we have established alternate suppliers, these suppliers may require significant levels of support to bring complex technologies to production. As a result, we may invest a significant amount of effort and resources and incur higher costs to support and maintain such alternate suppliers. Further, any future consolidation of foundry suppliers could increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and reduce our suppliers’ willingness to negotiate pricing, which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reductions and/or which could increase our manufacturing costs. Our arrangements with our suppliers may obligate us to incur costs to manufacture and test our products that do not decrease at the same rate as decreases in pricing to our customers. Our ability, and that of our suppliers, to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies, and to effectively compete with the manufacturing processes and performance of our competitors, could impact our ability to introduce new products and meet customer demand, could increase our costs (possibly decreasing our margins) and could subject us to the risk of excess inventories. Our inability to meet customer demand due to sole- or limited-sourcing and/or the additional costs that we incur because of these or other supply constraints or because of the need to support alternate suppliers could negatively impact our business, our results of operations and/or cash flows.Although we have long-term contracts with our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific quantity, our suppliers may allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the production and testing of products 28for their other customers while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture or test our products. Accordingly, capacity for our products may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. To the extent we do obtain long-term capacity commitments, we may incur additional costs related to those commitments and/or make non-refundable payments for capacity commitments that are not used.One or more of our suppliers or potential alternate suppliers may manufacture CDMA- or OFDMA-based integrated circuits that compete with our products. Such suppliers could elect to allocate raw materials and manufacturing capacity to their own products and reduce or limit deliveries to us to our detriment. In addition, we may not receive reasonable pricing, manufacturing or delivery terms from our suppliers. We cannot guarantee that the actions of our suppliers will not cause disruptions in our operations that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers or increase our cost of sales.Additionally, we place orders with our suppliers using our and/or our customers’ forecasts of customer demand, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates. As we move to smaller geometry process technologies, the manufacturing lead-time increases. As a result, the orders we place with our suppliers are generally only partially covered by commitments from our customers. If we, or our customers, overestimate customer demand that is not under a binding commitment from our customer, we may experience increased excess and/or obsolete inventory, which would negatively impact our results of operations. Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business.From time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights against our products or products using our technologies or other technologies used in our industry. These claims have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such litigation given, among other factors, the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products or services were found to infringe another company’s intellectual property rights, we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our products or services, which could be costly, or to license such rights and/or pay damages or other compensation to such other company. If we are unable to redesign our products or services, license such intellectual property rights used in our products or services or otherwise distribute our products (e.g., through a licensed supplier), we could be prohibited from making and selling such products or providing such services. In any potential dispute involving other companies’ patents or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and/or damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products or services sold or provided by us, or by intellectual property provided by us to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and/or cash flows. Furthermore, any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could hurt our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales and/or reductions in our licensees’ sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset and/or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delays, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.We expect that we may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (and/or on the sale of our customers’ devices using such products) and/or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct and/or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our chipset customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our worldwide chipset sales and/or a reduction in our licensees’ sales to wireless operators, causing corresponding declines in our chipset and/or licensing revenues.Certain legal matters, including certain claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property, are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” 29We may engage in strategic acquisitions, transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.We engage in strategic acquisitions and other transactions, including joint ventures, and make investments, which we believe are important to the future of our business, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. We acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology, wireless spectrum and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions and purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services) for voice and data communications and new industry segments. Recent material transactions include our RF360 Holdings joint venture with TDK Corporation and our acquisition of CSR plc. Many of our strategic activities entail a high degree of risk and require the use of domestic and/or foreign capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies, products or services. We may underestimate the costs and/or overestimate the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership interests. In addition, we may record impairment charges related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited. Achieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions, including joint ventures and other strategic investments in which we have management and operational control, depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, technology, products, processes, operations (including manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers and suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development and/or supply operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not derive any commercial value from associated technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these technologies, and we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain, and we may become subject to litigation. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sales or distribution channels, business or operational models (including manufacturing), geographic regions, industry segments and/or categories of products served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of the combination. If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions or other strategic activities, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transactions.In fiscal 2018, we terminated our proposed acquisition of NXP since the acquisition had not been approved by the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) in China by the date specified in the acquisition agreement. As a result, we will not realize the benefits that we anticipated from the acquisition, including, but not limited to, increased revenues; accelerated revenue diversification; significantly expanded addressable markets and opportunities; accelerated entry into new industry segments and expansion in existing industry segments; new and expanded product offerings and technologies; accelerated expansion of sales and distribution channels; cost and other synergies; and earnings accretion from the acquisition. In addition, future acquisitions may now be more difficult, complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed. Further, if U.S./China trade relations remain strained, our ability to consummate any transaction that would require approval from SAMR may be severely impacted.If we are unsuccessful in executing our cost plan, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.In the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced a cost plan designed to align our cost structure to our long-term margin targets. As part of this plan, we are implementing a series of targeted reductions across our businesses to reduce annual costs by $1 billion, excluding incremental costs resulting from any future acquisition of a business. We expect these cost reductions to be fully captured in fiscal 2019. We cannot provide assurance that our cost plan will be successful, that anticipated cost savings will be realized, that our operations, business and financial results will improve and/or that these efforts will not disrupt our operations (beyond what is intended). Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits within the expected time frames is subject 30to many estimates and assumptions, which are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Further, we may experience delays in the timing of these efforts and/or higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing them. Moreover, changes in the size, alignment or organization of our workforce could adversely affect employee morale and retention, relations with customers and business partners, our ability to develop and deliver products and services as anticipated and/or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives. If we do not succeed in these efforts, if these efforts are more costly or time-consuming than expected, if our estimates and assumptions are not correct, if we experience delays or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.We are subject to various laws, regulations, policies and standards. Our business may suffer as a result of existing, or new or amended, laws, regulations, policies or standards and/or our failure or inability to comply with laws, regulations, policies or standards.Our business, products and services, and those of our customers and licensees, are subject to various laws and regulations globally, as well as government policies and the specifications of international, national and regional communications standards bodies. Compliance with existing laws, regulations, policies and standards, the adoption of new laws, regulations, policies or standards, changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, policies or standards, changes in the regulation of our activities by a government or standards body and/or rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such laws, regulations, policies or standards, including, among others, those affecting licensing practices, competitive business practices, the use of our technology or products, protection of intellectual property, trade and trade protection, including tariffs, foreign currency, investments or loans, spectrum availability and license issuance, adoption of standards, the provision of device subsidies by wireless operators to their customers, taxation, export control, privacy and data protection, environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, human rights, corporate governance, public disclosure or business conduct could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Government policies, particularly in China, that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of a country may impact the timing of our receipt of payments from our customers and/or licensees in such country, which may negatively impact our cash flows.Delays in government approvals or other governmental activities that could result from, among others, a decrease in or a lack of funding for certain agencies or branches of the government and/or political changes, could result in our incurring higher costs, could negatively impact our ability to timely consummate strategic transactions and/or could have other negative impacts on our business and the businesses of our customers and licensees.National, state and local environmental laws and regulations affect our operations around the world. These laws may make it more expensive to manufacture, have manufactured and sell products, and our costs could increase if our vendors (e.g., suppliers, third-party manufacturers or utility companies) pass on their costs to us. The imposition of tariffs on raw materials or our products could have a negative impact on our revenues and/or results of operations. We are also subject to laws and regulations impacting the manufacturing operations of our RF360 Holdings joint venture. See the Risk Factor entitled “There are numerous risks associated with our operation and control of the manufacturing facilities of our joint venture with TDK, RF360 Holdings, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model, environmental compliance and liability, exposure to natural disasters, timely supply of equipment and materials and manufacturing difficulties.”Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country (collectively, the Covered Countries), or were from recycled or scrap sources. Other countries and/or regions are expected to impose similar requirements in the future. The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to determine that the conflict minerals used in our products do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Covered Countries, we may face challenges with our customers that place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. Similarly, other laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that require additional transparency regarding the employment practices of our suppliers, and any failure to maintain responsible sourcing practices could also adversely affect our relationships with customers and our reputation.Laws, regulations, policies and standards are complex and changing and may create uncertainty regarding compliance. Laws, regulations, policies and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases, and their application in practice may evolve over time. As a result, our efforts to comply may fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. Failure to comply with any law, regulation, policy or standard may adversely affect our business, results 31of operations and/or cash flows. New laws, regulations, policies and standards or evolving interpretations of legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies and/or procedures and may divert management time and attention to compliance activities.Our use of open source software may harm our business.Certain of our software and our suppliers’ software may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, and we have seen, and believe we will continue to see, an increase in customers requesting that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. Also, our use and our customers’ use of open source software may subject our products and our customers’ products to governmental scrutiny and delays in product certification, which could cause customers to view our products as less desirable than our competitors’ products. While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property rights, our use of open source software presents risks that could have an adverse effect on these rights and on our business.Our stock price, earnings and the fair value of our investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market downturns.Our stock price and earnings have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock and/or earnings include those identified throughout this Risk Factors section, volatility of the stock market in general and technology-based companies in particular, announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers or licensees and variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors, among others. Further, increased volatility in the financial markets and/or overall economic conditions may reduce the amounts that we realize in the future on our cash equivalents and/or marketable securities and may reduce our earnings as a result of any impairment charges that we record to reduce recorded values of marketable securities to their fair values.In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Due to changes in our stock price, we are and may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s attention and our resources. Certain legal matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”There are risks associated with our indebtedness and our significant proposed stock repurchase program.Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur, may have negative consequences on our business, including, among others:•requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends or other general corporate and other purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and/or•increasing our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations to the extent a portion of our debt has variable interest rates.Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to general economic conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, including factors which negatively impact our cash flows, such as licensees withholding some or all of the royalty payments they owe to us or paying fines in connection with regulatory investigations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such refinancing, restructuring 32or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing and/or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such refinancing and/or restructuring would increase. If there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt in the future and/or the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.We have implemented a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $30 billion of our outstanding common stock. This stock repurchase program has significantly reduced and will continue to reduce the amount of cash that we have available to fund our operations, including research and development, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, dividends and other corporate purposes; and increases our exposure to adverse economic, market, industry and competitive conditions and developments, and other changes in our business and our industry. In addition, this significant decrease in our cash reserves exacerbates the risks described above associated with our indebtedness.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our information technology systems, or other misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary or confidential information.Third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, and most of such attempts are increasingly more sophisticated. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, criminal hackers or state-sponsored intrusions, include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers and networks, including those in our manufacturing operations, and impersonating authorized users, among others. Such attempts could result in the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure or loss or destruction of the intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, as well as damage to or disruptions in our information technology systems. These threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures.We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence but attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems may be successful, and in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure or loss or destruction of the intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, cause us to lose business, damage our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings, cause us to incur other loss or liability and/or otherwise adversely affect our business. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our information technology systems.In addition, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, customers or licensees, may misappropriate, use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers or licensees our intellectual property and/or proprietary or confidential business information. Similarly, we provide access to certain of our intellectual property and/or proprietary and/or confidential business information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees, who may wrongfully use such intellectual property and/or information and/or wrongfully disclose such intellectual property and/or information to third parties, including our competitors. Potential tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, including Singapore where our QCT segment’s non-U.S. headquarters is located. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly are subject to examination of our tax returns and reports by taxing authorities in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, most notably in countries where we earn a routine return and the tax authorities believe substantial value-add activities are performed. Our current examinations are at various stages with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts give rise to a revision become known. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable at September 30, 2018, the final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In such case, our income tax provision, results of operations and/or cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made could be negatively affected.On December 22, 2017, tax reform legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Legislation) was enacted in the United States. Given the amount and complexity of the changes in tax law resulting from the Tax Legislation, we have not finalized the accounting for the income tax effects of the Tax Legislation. This includes the provisional amounts recorded related to the repatriation tax on deemed repatriated earnings and profits of U.S.-owned foreign subsidiaries (Toll Charge). Further, we are in the process of analyzing the effects of new taxes due on certain foreign income, such as GILTI (global intangible low-taxed income), BEAT (base-erosion anti-abuse tax), FDII (foreign-derived intangible income) and limitations 33on interest expense deductions (if certain conditions apply) that are effective starting in fiscal 2019, and other provisions of the Tax Legislation. The impact of the Tax Legislation related to the Toll Charge may differ from this estimate, possibly materially, during the one-year measurement period due to, among other things, further refinement of our calculations, changes in interpretations and assumptions we have made, guidance that may be issued and actions we may take as a result of the Tax Legislation. We have tax incentives in Singapore provided that we meet specified employment and other criteria, and as a result of the expiration of these incentives, our Singapore tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal 2022 and again in fiscal 2027. If we do not meet the criteria required to retain such incentives, our Singapore tax rate could increase prior to fiscal 2022, and our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.Tax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to transfer pricing. These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow. We have not yet determined what changes, if any, may be needed to our operations or structure to address BEPS. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the United States or Singapore, our results of operations, cash flows and/or financial condition could be adversely affected.Global, regional or local economic conditions, or political actions including trade protection policies such as tariffs, that impact the mobile communications industry or the other industries in which we operate could negatively affect the demand for our products and services and our customers’ or licensees’ products and services, which may negatively affect our revenues.A decline in global, regional or local economic conditions or a slow-down in economic growth, or political actions including trade protection policies such as tariffs, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or licensees, could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on demand for our products and for the products and services of our customers or licensees, particularly equipment manufacturers or others in the wireless communications industry who buy their products, such as wireless operators. Any prolonged economic downturn or “trade war” may result in a decrease in demand for our products or technologies; the products of our customers or licensees; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting and/or payments from our licensees and/or customers; failures by counterparties; and negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers’ ability to purchase or pay for our products and services and network operators’ ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be adversely affected by economic conditions, leading to a reduction, cancelation or delay of orders for our products or services.We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them, which may become increasingly difficult in an environment of cost reductions. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenues, harm our ability to collect receivables or increase the U.S. dollar cost of our products.Our customers sell their products throughout the world in various currencies. Our consolidated revenues from international customers and licensees as a percentage of our total revenues were greater than 90% in each of the last three fiscal years. Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business, revenues, results of operations and/or cash flows due to a number of factors, including, among others:•Our products and those of our customers and licensees that are sold outside the United States may become less price-competitive, which may result in reduced demand for those products and/or downward pressure on average selling prices; 34•Certain of our revenues that are derived from products that are sold in foreign currencies could decrease, resulting in lower revenues, cash flows and margins; •Certain of our revenues, such as royalties, that are derived from licensee or customer sales denominated in foreign currencies could decrease, resulting in lower revenues and cash flows;•Our foreign suppliers may raise their prices if they are impacted by currency fluctuations, resulting in higher than expected costs and lower margins; •Certain of our costs that are denominated in foreign currencies could increase, resulting in higher than expected costs and cash outflows; and/or•Foreign exchange hedging transactions that we engage in to reduce the impact of currency fluctuations may require the payment of structuring fees, limit the U.S. dollar value of royalties from licensees’ sales that are denominated in foreign currencies, cause earnings volatility if the hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting and expose us to counterparty risk if the counterparty fails to perform.Failures in our products or services or in the products or services of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.The use of devices containing our products to interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. While we continue to focus on this issue and are taking measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities continue to evolve, enabling more elaborate functionality and applications, and increasing the risk of security failures. Further, our products are inherently complex and may contain defects or errors that are detected only when the products are in use. Because our products and services are responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products and/or networks, security failures, defects or errors in our products or services could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and/or on the end users of our customers’ products. Such adverse impact could include shipment delays; product liability claims or recalls; write-offs of our inventories, property, plant and equipment and/or intangible assets; unfavorable purchase commitments; a shift of business to our competitors; a decrease in demand for connected devices and wireless services; damage to our reputation and our customer relationships; regulatory actions; and other financial liability or harm to our business. Further, security failures, defects or errors in the products of our customers or licensees could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and/or cash flows due to a delay or decrease in demand for our products or services generally, and our premium-tier products in particular, among other factors. Development of products and features in new domains of technology and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes are complex and add risk to manufacturing yields and reliability. Further, manufacturing, testing, marketing and use of our products and those of our customers and licensees entail the risk of product liability. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2. PropertiesAt September 30, 2018, we occupied the following facilities (square footage in millions): United States Other Countries TotalOwned facilities4.5 0.3 4.8Leased facilities1.1 5.1 6.2Total5.6 5.4 11.0Our headquarters as well as certain research and development, manufacturing and network management hub operations are located in San Diego, California.

Our facility leases expire at varying dates through 2026, not including renewals that are at our option. Several other owned and leased facilities are under construction totaling approximately 437,000 additional square feet. 35We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and that the productive capacity in facilities that are not under construction is substantially utilized. We do not identify or allocate facilities by operating segment. Additional information on net property, plant and equipment by geography is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.” In the future, we may need to purchase, build or lease additional facilities to meet the requirements projected in our long-term business plan.Item 3. Legal and Regulatory ProceedingsInformation regarding legal and regulatory proceedings is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We are also engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business and, while there can be no assurance, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Item 4. Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable. 36Part IIItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket Information and DividendsOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol “QCOM.” At November 5, 2018, there were 6,887 holders of record of our common stock. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements, including those relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales and distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, legal risks, withholding of payments by one or more of our significant licensees and/or customers, fines by government agencies and/or adverse rulings by a court or arbitrator in a legal matter, stock repurchase programs, debt issuances, changes in federal and state income tax law and changes to our business model.Share-Based CompensationWe primarily issue restricted stock units under our equity compensation plans, which are part of a broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and directors and align stockholder and employee interests.Our 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2016 Plan) provides for the grant of both incentive and nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, unrestricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, performance shares, deferred compensation awards and other stock-based awards. Restricted stock units generally vest over periods of three years from the date of grant. Stock options vest over periods not exceeding five years and are exercisable for up to ten years from the grant date. The Board of Directors may amend or terminate the 2016 Plan at any time, with certain amendments also requiring stockholder approval.Additional information regarding our share-based compensation plans and plan activity for fiscal 2018, 2017 and 2016 is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIn addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report.The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in “Part II,",2023-12-30 18:21:50.960876
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2019,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the “Our Business and Operating Segments” section under the heading “Seasonality.”Cost PlanIn the second quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced a Cost Plan designed to align our cost structure to our long-term margin targets. As part of this plan, we initiated a series of targeted actions across our businesses with the objective to reduce annual costs by $1 billion, excluding incremental costs resulting from any future acquisition of a business. Actions taken under this plan have been completed and resulted in us achieving substantially all of this target in fiscal 2019 based on our run rate exiting the second quarter of fiscal 2019, excluding litigation costs that were in excess of the baseline spend.Additional information regarding our Cost Plan is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 10. Cost Plan.”Corporate StructureWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.Revenue Concentrations and Significant CustomersA small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017, revenues from Apple Inc. and its contract manufacturers (Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Ltd./Foxconn, its affiliates and other suppliers to Apple), Samsung Electronics and combined revenues from GuangDong 13OPPO Mobile Telecommunications and vivo Communication Technology, and their respective affiliates (including BBK), each comprised 10% or more of consolidated revenues. Revenues from Xiaomi also comprised 10% or more of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2019 and 2018. Revenues in fiscal 2018 and 2017 were negatively impacted by our prior dispute with Apple Inc. and its contract manufacturers. Revenues in fiscal 2019 were positively impacted by our settlement of such dispute in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. We expect to begin recording revenues for new chipset models under our recently announced multi-year chipset agreement with Apple in the second half of fiscal 2020. Research and DevelopmentThe wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in CDMA, OFDMA and a broad range of other technologies. Using these engineering resources, we expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products, and to utilize that research and development in adjacent industry segments outside of traditional cellular industries (such as automotive, computing, IoT and networking), including continuing the development of CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies (such as RF), developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies, and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world. Our research and development team has a demonstrated track record of innovation in voice and data communication technologies and application processor technology, among others.We continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in OFDMA-based 4G technologies (including LTE) and 5G technologies. We also engage in acquisitions and other transactions, such as joint ventures, to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or open or expand opportunities for our technologies and to support the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products and services) for voice and data communications and new industry segments outside of the traditional cellular industry. Our most recent significant transaction was the formation of, and subsequent acquisition of the remaining minority ownership interest in, RF360 Holdings to enable delivery of RFFE modules and RF filters into fully integrated products for mobile devices and IoT applications, among others. See “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9. Acquisitions” in this Annual Report for additional information.We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets and laptops), consumer electronics and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G, 4G and 5G technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, location positioning and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other mobile client software environments in our chipsets.We develop on our own, and with our partners, innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition.We have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world that support our global development activities and ongoing efforts to develop and/or advance 4G, 5G and a broad range of other technologies. We continue to use our substantial engineering resources and expertise to develop new technologies, applications and services and make them available to licensees to help grow the communications industry and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities.We also make investments in opportunities that leverage our existing technical and business expertise to deploy new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and enter into adjacent industry segments, such as products for automotive, computing, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics) and networking, among others.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing activities of our operating segments are discussed under Operating Segments. Other marketing activities include public relations, advertising, digital marketing and social media, participation in technical conferences and trade shows, development of business cases and white papers, competitive analyses, industry intelligence and other marketing programs, such as marketing and/or market development funds with our customers. Our Corporate Marketing department 14provides company information on our Internet site and through other channels regarding our products, strategies and technology to industry analysts and media.CompetitionCompetition faced by our operating segments is discussed under Operating Segments. Competition in the wireless communications industry throughout the world continues to increase at a rapid pace as consumers, businesses and governments realize the potential of wireless communications products and services. We have facilitated competition in the wireless communications industry by licensing our technologies to a large number of manufacturers. Although we have attained a significant position in the traditional cellular industry, many of our current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to use our competitors’ integrated circuit products, to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products or sell such products to others, including by selling them together with certain of their other products, or to choose alternative technologies; lower cost structures or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices and lower or negative margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies or competitors or original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) that sell devices that do not contain our chipsets; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and OEMs in certain geographic regions (such as China); more experience in adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries (such as automotive, computing, IoT and networking); and a more established presence in certain regions. These relationships may affect customers’ decisions to purchase products or license technology from us. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market positions to our detriment. We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings and introduce new technologies and services in the future and as additional companies compete with our products or services based on 3G, 4G, 5G or other technologies. Although we intend to continue to make substantial investments in developing new products and technologies and improving existing products and technologies to strengthen and/or maintain our competitive position, our competitors may introduce alternative products, services or technologies that threaten our business. It is also possible that the prices we charge for our products and services may continue to decline as competition continues to intensify. See also the Risk Factor entitled “Our industry is subject to competition in an environment of rapid technological changes. Our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such changes and compete effectively; and such changes and competition could result in decreased demand for our products or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our customers or licensees.”Corporate Responsibility and SustainabilityWe strive to better our local and global communities through ethical business practices, socially empowering technology applications, educational and environmental programs and employee diversity and volunteerism.•Our Governance.

Risk FactorsYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business and results of operations and require significant management time and attention. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” References to “and” and “or” should be read to include the other as well as “and/or,” as appropriate.Risks Related to Our BusinessesOur revenues depend on commercial network deployments, expansions and upgrades of CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, including 5G; our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on these technologies; and customers’ demand for our products and services.We develop, patent and commercialize technology and products based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, which are primarily wireless. We depend on operators of wireless networks and our customers and licensees to adopt and implement the latest generation of these technologies for use in their networks, devices and services. We also depend on our customers and licensees to develop devices and services based on these technologies with value-added features to drive consumer demand for new 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices, as well as 3G, 4G and 5G single-mode devices, and to establish the selling prices for such devices. Further, we depend on the timing of our customers’ and licensees’ deployments of new devices and services based on these technologies. Increasingly, we also depend on operators of wireless networks, our customers and licensees and other third parties to incorporate these technologies into new device types and into industries and applications beyond traditional cellular communications, such as automotive, computing, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics) and networking, among others.We have historically been successful during wireless technology transitions, including 3G and 4G. The next generation of wireless technologies is 5G, which we expect will empower a new era of connected devices and will be utilized not only in handsets but in new device types, industries and applications beyond traditional cellular communications, as described above (see also Part I, Item 1, “Business” for further description of 5G). Initial commercial deployments of 5G networks and devices have begun and will continue into fiscal 2020 and beyond. We believe it is important that we remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and that we develop, commercialize and be a leading supplier of 5G integrated circuit products and services, in order to sustain and grow our business long-term. 17Our revenues and growth in revenues could be negatively impacted, our business may be harmed and our substantial investments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return, if:•wireless operators and industries beyond traditional cellular communications deploy alternative technologies;•wireless operators delay next-generation network deployments, expansions or upgrades or delay moving customers to 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices, as well as 4G and 5G single-mode devices;•LTE, an OFDMA-based wireless technology, is not more widely deployed or further commercial deployment is delayed;•government regulators delay making sufficient spectrum available for 4G and 5G wireless technologies, including unlicensed spectrum and shared spectrum technologies, thereby delaying or precluding the initial deployment or expanded deployment of these technologies;•wireless operators delay or do not drive improvements in 4G or 5G, or 3G/4G or 3G/4G/5G multimode network performance and capacity;•our customers’ and licensees’ revenues and sales of products, particularly premium-tier products, and services using these technologies, and average selling prices (ASPs) of such products, decline, do not grow or do not grow meaningfully due to, for example, the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed regions;•our intellectual property and technical leadership included in the continued 5G standardization effort is different than in 3G and 4G standards;•the continued standardization or commercial deployment of 5G technologies is delayed; •we are unable to drive the adoption of our products and services into networks and devices, including devices beyond traditional cellular applications, based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies; or•consumers’ rates of replacement of smartphones and other computing devices decline, do not grow or do not grow meaningfully.Our industry is subject to competition in an environment of rapid technological changes. Our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such changes and compete effectively; and such changes and competition could result in decreased demand for our products or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our customers or licensees. Our products, services and technologies face significant competition. We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to maintain existing business and customers or attract new business and customers, as new opportunities develop and as new competitors enter the industry. Competition in wireless communications is affected by various factors that include, among others: device manufacturer concentrations; vertical integration; growth in demand, consumption and competition in certain geographic regions; government intervention or support of national industries or competitors; evolving industry standards and business models; evolving methods of transmission of voice and data communications; increasing data traffic and densification of wireless networks; convergence and aggregation of connectivity technologies (including Wi-Fi and LTE) in both devices and access points; consolidation of wireless technologies and infrastructure at the network edge; networking and connectivity trends (including cloud services); use of licensed, shared and unlicensed spectrum; the evolving nature of computing (including demand for always on, always connected capabilities); the speed of technological change (including the transition to smaller geometry process technologies); value-added features that drive selling prices and consumer demand for new 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices, as well as 3G, 4G and 5G single-mode devices; turnkey, integrated products that incorporate hardware, software, user interface, applications and reference designs; scalability; and the ability of the system technology to meet customers’ immediate and future network requirements. We anticipate that additional competitors will introduce products as a result of growth opportunities in wireless communications, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, technological and public policy changes and relatively low barriers to entry in certain segments of the industry. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape.We expect that our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:•differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features (e.g., modem, RFFE, graphics and other processors, camera and connectivity) and with smaller geometry process technologies that drive both performance and lower power consumption;•develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points to effectively cover both emerging and developed geographic regions and all device tiers;•drive the adoption of our integrated circuit products into the most popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and other computing devices, automobiles, wearables, voice and music and other connected devices and infrastructure products; 18•maintain or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit products at the premium device tier, while also driving the adoption of our 5G products into high, mid- and low-tier devices across all regions;•continue to be a leader in 4G and 5G technology evolution and continue to innovate and introduce 4G and 5G turnkey, integrated products and services that differentiate us from our competition;•remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and develop, commercialize and be a leading supplier of 5G integrated circuit products and services; •increase or accelerate demand for our semiconductor component products, including RFFE, and our wireless connectivity products, including networking products for consumers, carriers and enterprise equipment and connected devices;•become a leading supplier of RFFE products, which are designed to address cellular radio frequency band fragmentation while improving radio frequency performance and assist original equipment manufacturers in developing multiband, multimode mobile devices; •create standalone value and contribute to the success of our existing businesses through acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions, and by developing customer, licensee, vendor, distributor and other channel relationships in new industry segments and with disruptive technologies, products and services, such as products for automotive, computing, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics) and networking, among others; •identify potential acquisition targets that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic needs, reach agreement on terms acceptable to us, close the transactions and effectively integrate these new businesses, products and technologies; •be a leader serving original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), high level operating systems (HLOS) providers, operators, cloud providers and other industry participants as competitors, new industry entrants and other factors continue to affect the industry landscape;•be a preferred partner and sustain preferred relationships providing integrated circuit products that support multiple operating system and infrastructure platforms to industry participants that effectively commercialize new devices using these platforms; and•continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in computing and other consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging regions and China.We compete with many different semiconductor companies, ranging from multinational companies with integrated research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing organizations across a broad spectrum of product lines, to companies that are focused on a single application market segment or standard product, including those that produce products for automotive, computing, IoT and networking applications. Most of these competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our businesses. Companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Broadcom, Cirrus Logic, Cypress Semiconductor, HiSilicon, Intel, Marvell, Maxim, MediaTek, Microchip Technology, Murata, Nordic Semiconductor, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Realtek Semiconductor, Renesas, Samsung, Sequans Communications, Skyworks and Spreadtrum Communications (which is controlled by Tsinghua Unigroup). Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to use our competitors’ integrated circuit products, to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products or sell such products to others, or to choose alternative technologies; lower cost structures or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower or negative margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies, competitors or OEMs that sell devices that do not contain our chipsets; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and OEMs in certain geographic regions (such as China); more experience in adjacent industry segments outside traditional cellular industries (such as automotive, computing, IoT and networking); and a more established presence in certain regions. In particular, certain of our largest integrated circuit customers develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future choose to utilize in certain (or all) of their devices, rather than our products (and they may sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us). Also, Apple, which has historically been one of our largest customers, now utilizes products of one of our competitors in many of their devices rather than our products and is solely utilizing one of our competitor’s products in its most recent smartphone launch. Apple may continue to use our competitors’ products in one or more of its future devices and may develop and utilize its own modem products, rather than our products, in one or more of its future devices. 19Further, certain of our competitors develop and sell multiple components (including integrated circuit products) for use in devices and sell those components together to device manufacturers. Our competitors’ sales of multiple components put us (and our discrete integrated circuit products) at a competitive disadvantage. Certain of our competitors also develop and sell infrastructure equipment for wireless networks and can optimize their integrated circuit products to perform on such networks to a degree that we are not able to, which again puts us at a competitive disadvantage.Competition in any or all product tiers may result in the loss of business or customers, which would negatively impact our revenues, results of operations and cash flows. Such competition may also reduce average selling prices for our chipset products or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging regions and China where competitors may have lower cost structures or may have a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower or negative margins on their products (particularly in China). Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees’ products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, which increasingly includes a small number of Chinese OEMs. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.Our QCT segment derives a significant portion of its revenues from a small number of customers, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Chinese OEMs continue to grow their device share in China and are increasing their device share in regions outside of China, and we derive a significant and increasing portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs. In addition, certain of our largest integrated circuit customers develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future choose to utilize in certain (or all) of their devices, rather than our products (and they may sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us). Also, Apple, which has historically been one of our largest customers, utilizes products of one of our competitors in many of their devices rather than our products and is solely utilizing one of our competitor’s products in its most recent smartphone launch. In April 2019, we entered into a new multi-year chipset supply agreement with Apple. We do not expect to begin recording revenues under this agreement until the second half of fiscal 2020. However, Apple may continue to use our competitors’ products in one or more of its future devices and may develop and utilize its own modem products, rather than our products, in one or more of its future devices. Similarly, certain of our Chinese OEM customers have developed and others may in the future develop their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products, or other integrated circuit products, in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, whether due to pressure from the Chinese government as part of its broader economic policies, the OEMs’ concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of U.S./Chinese trade tensions, or otherwise.Further, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers, or limit or prevent certain of our customers from transacting business with us. Finally, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers’ feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.The loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by such customers or the cancelation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors’ integrated circuit products, government restrictions or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations, and a delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development. Further, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by 20the timing of such customers’ new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate. Accordingly, if current industry dynamics continue, our QCT segment’s revenues will continue to depend largely upon, and be impacted by, future purchases, and the timing and size of any such future purchases, by these significant customers.Further, to the extent Apple purchases our modem products, it purchases our Mobile Data Modem (MDM) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. To the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.Further, companies that develop HLOS for devices, including leading technology companies, sell their own devices. If we fail to effectively partner or continue partnering with these companies, or with their partners or customers, they may decide not to purchase (either directly or through their contract manufacturers), or to reduce or discontinue their purchases of, our integrated circuit products.In addition, there has been and continues to be litigation among certain of our customers and other industry participants, and the potential outcomes of such litigation, including but not limited to injunctions against devices that incorporate our products or intellectual property, and rulings on certain patent law or patent licensing issues that create new legal precedent, could impact our business, particularly if such action impacts one of our larger customers.Although we have more than 300 licensees, our QTL segment derives a significant portion of its revenues from a limited number of licensees, which increasingly includes a small number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of such license agreements under similar terms, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We have no control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees’ products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues. Such adverse impact may be mitigated by the per unit royalty caps that apply to certain categories of complete wireless devices, namely smartphones, tablets, laptops and smartwatches.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from the premium-tier device segment. If sales of premium-tier devices decrease, or sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products decrease, our results of operations could be negatively affected.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from the premium-tier device segment, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, lengthening replacement cycles in developed regions, where premium-tier smartphones are common; increasing consumer demand in emerging regions and China where premium-tier smartphones are less common and replacement cycles are on average longer than in developed regions and are continuing to lengthen; and a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles.In addition, as discussed in the prior risk factor, our industry is experiencing concentration of device share at the premium tier among a few companies, which gives them significant leverage. Further, certain of those companies have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products or our competitors’ integrated circuit products rather than our products in all or a portion of their devices. These dynamics may result in reduced sales of or lower prices for our premium-tier integrated circuit products.A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products) or a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our products to OEMs that do not utilize our products, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.Efforts by some communications equipment manufacturers or their customers to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business. 21From time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder’s ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) various attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers that results in lowering the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price on which the royalty is calculated.In addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property. Further, certain licensees and companies are currently engaged in such behavior and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows will be exacerbated.We have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, including the lawsuit filed against us by the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Certain of these matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. See the Risk Factors below entitled “Our business, particularly our licensing business, may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or proceedings” and “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations or private legal proceedings challenging those practices, or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.” In addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments. Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.Further, some companies or entities have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by severely limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies’) alleged failure to abide by these policies. Some SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted and may in the future adopt some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party.We expect that such proposals, interpretations and strategies will continue in the future, and if successful, our business model would be harmed, either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalties (or by reducing the royalties we can collect) on all or a portion of our standard-essential patent portfolio, limiting our return on investment with respect to new 22technologies, limiting our ability to seek injunctions against infringers of our standard-essential patents, constraining our ability to make licensing commitments when submitting our technology for inclusion in future standards (which could make our technology less likely to be included in such standards) or forcing us to work outside of SDOs or other industry groups to promote our new technologies, and our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, the legal and other costs associated with asserting or defending our positions have been and continue to be significant. We assume that such challenges, regardless of their merits, will continue into the foreseeable future and will require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources.Our business, particularly our licensing business, may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or proceedings.We have been in the past and are currently subject to various governmental investigations and proceedings, particularly with respect to our licensing business, including the lawsuit filed against us by the FTC. Certain of these matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” Key allegations or findings in those matters include, among others, that we violate FRAND licensing commitments by refusing to grant licenses to chipset makers, that our royalty rates are too high, that the base on which our royalties are calculated should be something less than the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of the applicable device (minus certain permitted deductions), that we unlawfully require customers to execute a patent license before we sell them cellular modem chipsets, that we have entered into exclusive agreements with chipset customers that foreclose competition, and that we violate antitrust laws, engage in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition. We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Depending on the matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patents; injunctions; monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money; the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices, such as requiring us to reduce our royalty rates, reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers, sell chipsets to unlicensed OEMs or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreements; and determinations that some or all of our license agreements are invalid or unenforceable. If some or all of our license agreements are declared invalid or unenforceable and/or we are required to renegotiate these license agreements, we may not receive, or may not be able to recognize, some or any licensing or royalty revenues under the impacted license agreements unless and until we enter into new license agreements; and even licensees whose license agreements are not impacted may demand to renegotiate their agreements or invoke the dispute resolution provision in their agreements, and we may not be able to recognize some or any licensing or royalty revenues under such agreements. The renegotiation of license agreements could lead to arbitration or litigation to resolve the licensing terms (which could be less favorable to us than existing terms), each of which could take months or possibly years. Licensees may underreport, underpay, not report or not pay royalties owed to us pending the conclusion of such negotiations, arbitration or litigation. In addition, we may be sued for alleged overpayments of past royalties paid to us, including private antitrust actions seeking treble damages under U.S. antitrust laws. Further, if our appeal in the FTC lawsuit is unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. Any such event could result in a materially negative impact on our financial condition, in which case we would have to significantly cut costs and other uses of cash, including in research and development, significantly impairing our ability to maintain product and technology leadership and invest in next generation technologies such as 5G. Further, depending on the breadth and severity of the circumstances above, we may have to reduce or eliminate our capital return programs, and our ability to timely pay our indebtedness may be impacted. If these events occur, our financial outlook and stock price could decline, possibly significantly. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may successfully assert and impose remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. These challenges have required, and we expect that they will continue to require, the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted, and we expect that they will continue to result, in increased legal costs until the respective matters are resolved. Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations or private legal proceedings challenging those practices, or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.As described in the Risk Factor above entitled “Our business, particularly our licensing business, may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or proceedings,” we have been in the past and are currently subject to various governmental investigations and proceedings and private legal proceedings challenging our patent licensing and chipset sales practices, including the lawsuit filed against us by the FTC. Certain of these matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We believe that one intent 23of these investigations and legal proceedings is to reduce the amount of royalties that licensees are required to pay to us for their use of our intellectual property. We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. We historically licensed our cellular standard-essential patents together with our other patents that may be useful to licensed products because licensees desired to obtain the commercial benefits of receiving such broad patent rights from us. However, we also licensed only our cellular standard-essential patents to certain licensees who requested such licenses. Since 2015, our standard practice in China is to offer licenses to our 3G and 4G (and now 5G) cellular standard-essential Chinese patents for devices sold for use in China separately from our other patents. In addition, we also offer licenses to only our cellular standard-essential patents (including 3G, 4G and 5G) for both single-mode and multimode devices on a worldwide basis, and since 2018, an increasing number of new and existing licensees have elected to enter into worldwide license agreements covering only our cellular standard-essential patents. Going forward, we continue to anticipate that a significant portion of our licensing revenues will be derived from licensees that have entered into license agreements covering only our cellular standard-essential patents. Our royalty rates for licenses to only our cellular standard-essential patents are lower than our royalty rates for licenses to substantially all of our patent portfolio. If more licensees choose a license to only our cellular standard-essential patents instead of a portfolio license than has historically been the case, our licensing revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted unless we were able to license our other patents at rates that offset all or a portion of any difference between the royalties previously received for licenses of substantially all of our patent portfolio as compared to licenses of only our cellular standard-essential patents or there was a sufficient increase in the overall volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid.If we were required to grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers (which could lead to implementing a more complex, multi-level licensing structure in which we license certain portions of our patent portfolio to chipset manufacturers and other portions to device manufacturers), we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, and we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed. In addition, our licensing revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain, in the aggregate, equivalent revenues under such a multi-level licensing structure.If we were required to reduce the royalty rates, we charge under our patent license agreements, our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted absent a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid. Similarly, if we were required to reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted unless there was a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid or we were able to increase our royalty rates to offset the decrease in revenues resulting from such lower royalty base (assuming the absolute royalty dollars were below any relevant royalty caps).If we were required to sell chipsets to OEMs that do not have a license to our patents, our licensing program could be negatively impacted by patent exhaustion claims raised by such unlicensed OEMs (i.e., claims that our sale of chipsets to such OEMs forecloses us from asserting any patents substantially embodied by the chipsets against such OEMs). Such sales would provide OEMs with a defense in the event we asserted our patents against them to obtain licensing revenue for those patents. This would have a material adverse effect on our licensing program and our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.To the extent that we were required to implement any of these new licensing and/or business practices, including by modifying or renegotiating our existing license agreements or pursuing other commercial arrangements, we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, and we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed. The impact of any such changes to our licensing practices could vary widely and by jurisdiction, depending on the specific outcomes and the geographic scope of such outcomes. In addition, if we were required to make modifications to our licensing practices in one jurisdiction, licensees or governmental agencies in other jurisdictions may attempt to obtain similar outcomes for themselves or for such other jurisdictions, as applicable.Finally, if our appeal in the FTC lawsuit is unsuccessful, it could have a material adverse effect on our business. The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property rights may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property rights and by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions.We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, international treaties and other methods, to protect our proprietary information, technologies and processes, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and proprietary information is difficult 24and time consuming. The steps we have taken have not always prevented, and we cannot be certain the steps we will take in the future will prevent, the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our proprietary information and technologies, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary intellectual property rights as fully or as readily as U.S. laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective. Some industry participants who have a vested interest in devaluing patents in general, or standard-essential patents in particular, have mounted attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established patent laws. In the United States, there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law changes and current and potential future litigation regarding patents, the outcomes of which could be detrimental to our licensing business. The laws in certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including certain countries in Asia, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States. We expect that the European Union (EU) will adopt a unitary patent system in the next few years that may broadly impact that region’s patent regime. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any potential changes. In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of any standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in the future in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our products or technologies.We have had, currently have, and may in the future have, difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property rights and contracts, including collecting royalties for use of our patent portfolio due to, among others: refusal by certain licensees to report and pay all or a portion of the royalties they owe to us; policies of foreign governments; challenges to our licensing practices under competition laws; adoption of mandatory licensing provisions by foreign jurisdictions; failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce judgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and challenges before competition agencies to our licensing business and the pricing and integration of additional features and functionality into our chipset products. Certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements for their use of our intellectual property. Further, certain licensees and companies are currently engaged in such behavior and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or not enter into, new license agreements. Additionally, although our license agreements provide us with the right to audit the books and records of licensees, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. Further, certain licensees may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their books and records. To the extent we do not aggressively enforce our rights under our license agreements, licensees may not comply with their existing license agreements, and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed companies to enter into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, other unlicensed companies may not enter into license agreements. Similarly, we provide access to certain of our intellectual property and proprietary and confidential business information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees, who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use such intellectual property and information or wrongfully disclose such intellectual property and information to third parties, including our competitors.We have engaged in litigation and arbitration in the past and may need to further litigate or arbitrate in the future to enforce our contract and intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation or arbitration, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable (which may in turn result in other licensees either not complying with their existing license agreements or initiating litigation), license terms (including but not limited to royalty rates for the use of our intellectual property) could be imposed that are less favorable to us than existing terms, and we could incur substantial costs. Any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Further, even a positive resolution to our enforcement efforts may take time to conclude, which may reduce our revenues and cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development, in the periods prior to conclusion. Our growth increasingly depends on our ability to extend our technologies, products and services into new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments and applications outside of traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, computing, IoT and networking, among others. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industry segments and applications, and related technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing technologies, products and services and new technologies, such as 5G, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations. 25Our industry is subject to rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions, and we must make substantial research, development and other investments, such as acquisitions, in new products, services and technologies to compete successfully. Technological innovations generally require significant research and development efforts before they are commercially viable. While we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies, we also invest in new and expanded product areas, and adjacent industry segments and applications, by leveraging our existing technical and business expertise and through acquisitions.In particular, our future growth significantly depends on new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments and applications outside of traditional cellular industries, such as automotive, computing, IoT (including the connected home, smart cities, wearables, voice and music and robotics) and networking, among others; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies, products and services for new and expanded product areas, adjacent industry segments and applications; and third parties incorporating our technologies, products and services into devices used in these product areas, industry segments and applications. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments and applications, and in developing new products, services and technologies for these product areas, industry segments and applications. Our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent 5G technologies, and to develop and commercialize products using 5G technologies.However, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments and applications, and corresponding technologies, products and services, as well as in our existing, technologies, products and services and new technologies, such as 5G, use of licensed, shared and unlicensed spectrum and convergence of cellular and Wi-Fi, may not succeed due to, among other reasons: we may not be issued patents on the technologies we develop; the technologies we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standards; new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments, applications and consumer demand may not develop or grow as anticipated; our strategies or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be successful; improvements in alternate technologies in ways that reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors’ technologies, products or services being more cost effective, having more capabilities or fewer limitations or being brought to market faster than our new technologies, products and services; we may not be able to develop, or our competitors may have more established and/or stronger, customer, vendor, distributor or other channel relationships; and competitors having longer operating histories in industry segments that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of or overestimate the future revenues or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns. Further, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in a significant barrier to entry and increased costs.If our new technologies, products and services are not successful, or are not successful in the time frame we anticipate, we may incur significant costs and asset impairments, our business may not grow meaningfully, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted, and our reputation may be harmed.There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model, environmental compliance and liability, exposure to natural disasters, timely supply of equipment and materials, and various manufacturing issues.While our QCT segment has historically utilized a fabless production model (which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made), we own and operate various facilities that manufacture our RFFE modules and RF filter acoustic products. Manufacturing facilities are characterized by a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model. We may be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products, including in less favorable industry environments. During such periods, our manufacturing facilities could operate at lower capacity levels, while the fixed costs associated with full capacity continue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit.We are subject to many environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing facilities, which govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air, wastewater discharges, the use and handling of hazardous substances, waste disposal, the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination and the health and safety of our employees. We are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. While we continue to take measures to comply, we cannot make assurances that we will be at all times in compliance with such laws, regulations and permits. Certain environmental laws 26impose strict, and in certain circumstances, joint and several, liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances. Certain of these laws also assess liability on persons who arrange for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities when such facilities are found to be contaminated. In addition, we could also be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage.We have manufacturing facilities in Asia and Europe. If tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters, or geopolitical conflicts, were to damage, destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facilities, it could disrupt our operations, delay new production and shipments of inventory and result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs. In addition, natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts may result in disruptions in transportation, distribution channels and supply chains, and significant increases in the prices of raw materials.Our manufacturing operations depend on securing raw materials and other supplies in adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner from multiple suppliers, and in some cases, we rely on a limited number of suppliers, particularly in Asia. Accordingly, there may be cases where supplies of raw materials and other products are interrupted by disaster, accident or some other event at a supplier, supply is suspended due to quality or other issues, or there is a shortage of supply due to a rapid increase in demand, which could impact production and prevent us from supplying products to our customers. If the supply-demand balance is disrupted, it may considerably increase costs of manufacturing due to increased prices we pay for raw materials. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit the amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Additionally, supply and costs of raw materials may be negatively impacted by trade and/or national security protection policies, such as tariffs, or actions by governments that limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain companies or that limit or prevent certain companies from transacting business with us, or escalating trade tensions, particularly with countries in Asia. Further, it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another. A failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations.Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production, and as a result, we may not be able to deliver products or do so in a timely, cost-effective or competitive manner. Further, to remain competitive and meet customer demand, we may be required to improve our facilities and process technologies and carry out extensive research and development, each of which may require investment of significant amounts of capital and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Finally, we typically begin manufacturing our products using our or our customers’ forecasts of customer demand, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates and are generally not covered by purchase commitments. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, which sales ultimately may not materialize or may be lower than expected. If we or our customer overestimate customer demand that is not under a binding commitment from our customer, we may experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and/or increased excess or obsolete inventory, which would negatively impact our results of operations. The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio, and our licensing programs may be impacted by the proliferation of devices in new industry segments such as automotive, computing, IoT and networking, as well as the need to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring or to cover additional future patents.We own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G, 5G and other technologies. It is critical that we continue to evolve our patent portfolio, particularly in 5G. If we do not maintain a strong portfolio that is applicable to current and future standards, products and services, particularly 5G, our future licensing revenues could be negatively impacted. In addition, new connectivity and other services are emerging that rely on devices that may or may not be used on traditional cellular networks, such as devices used in the automotive, computing, IoT and networking industry segments. Standards, even de facto standards, that develop as these technologies mature, in particular those that do not include a base level of interoperability, may impact our ability to obtain royalties at all or that are equivalent to those that we receive for products used in cellular communications. Although we believe that our patented technologies are essential and useful to the commercialization of such services, any royalties we receive may be lower than those we receive from our current licensing program.Further, the licenses granted to and from us under a number of our license agreements include only patents that are either filed or issued prior to a certain date. As a result, there are agreements with some licensees where later patents are not licensed by or to us. Additionally, all of our patent license agreements in China that were entered into in 2015 or thereafter, as 27well as our recent worldwide cellular standard-essential patent only agreements, are effective for a specified term. In order to license or to obtain a license to such later patents or after the expiration of the specified term, and to receive royalties after the expiration date of the specified term, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees more frequently than we have done historically. In particular, our license agreements with certain of our key Chinese licensees expire at the end of calendar year 2019. We might not be able to extend or modify those license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, in the future without negatively affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees, and such modifications or new agreements may negatively impact our revenues. In some circumstances, we may extend, modify or enter into new license agreements as a result of arbitration or litigation, and terms imposed by arbitrators or courts may be less favorable to us than existing terms. If there is a delay in extending, modifying or entering into a new license agreement with a licensee, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize revenues related to that licensee’s product sales. Further, if we are unable to reach agreement on such modifications or new agreements, it could result in patent infringement litigation with such companies.We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide technology leadership, supply assurance and low cost, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.Our QCT segment primarily utilizes a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Other than the facilities we own that manufacture our RFFE modules and RF filter acoustic products, we rely on independent third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Under the turnkey model, our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party suppliers for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and the majority of our final test requirements. The semiconductor manufacturing foundries that supply products to our QCT segment are primarily located in Asia, as are our primary warehouses where we store finished goods for fulfillment of customer orders. The following could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively impact our revenues, business operations, profitability and cash flows:•a reduction, interruption, delay or limitation in our product supply sources;•a failure by our suppliers to procure raw materials or to provide or allocate adequate raw materials, manufacturing or test capacity for our products;•our suppliers’ inability to react to shifts in product demand or an increase in raw material or component prices;•our suppliers’ delay in developing leading process technologies, or inability to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies;•the loss of a supplier or the inability of a supplier to meet performance, quality or yield specifications or delivery schedules; •additional expense or production delays as a result of qualifying a new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of, or a decision to add or change, a supplier; and•natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts impacting our suppliers.Additionally, supply and costs of raw materials may be negatively impacted by trade or national security protection policies, such as tariffs, or actions by governments that limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain companies or that limit or prevent certain companies from transacting business with us, or escalating trade tensions, particularly with countries in Asia. While we have established alternate suppliers for certain technologies, we rely on sole- or limited-source suppliers for certain products, subjecting us to significant risks, including: possible shortages of raw materials or manufacturing capacity; poor product performance; and reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing capability and yields, quality assurance, quantity and costs. To the extent we have established alternate suppliers, these suppliers may require significant levels of support to bring complex technologies to production. As a result, we may invest a significant amount of effort and resources and incur higher costs to support and maintain such alternate suppliers. Further, any future consolidation of foundry suppliers could increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and reduce our suppliers’ willingness to negotiate pricing, which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reductions and could increase our manufacturing costs. Our arrangements with our suppliers may obligate us to incur costs to manufacture and test our products that do not decrease at the same rate as decreases in pricing to our customers. Our ability, and that of our suppliers, to develop or 28maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies, and to effectively compete with the manufacturing processes and performance of our competitors, could impact our ability to introduce new products and meet customer demand, could increase our costs (possibly decreasing our margins) and could subject us to the risk of excess inventories. Any of the above could negatively impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.Although we have long-term contracts with our suppliers, many of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific quantity, our suppliers may allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the production and testing of products for their other customers while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture or test our products. Accordingly, capacity for our products may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. To the extent we do obtain long-term capacity commitments, we may incur additional costs related to those commitments or make non-refundable payments for capacity commitments that are not used.Our suppliers or potential alternate suppliers may manufacture CDMA- or OFDMA-based integrated circuits, for themselves or for other companies, that compete with our products. Such suppliers have in the past and could again elect to allocate raw materials and manufacturing capacity to their own products or products of our competitors and reduce or limit deliveries to us to our detriment.In addition, we may not receive reasonable pricing, manufacturing or delivery terms from our suppliers. We cannot guarantee that the actions of our suppliers will not cause disruptions in our operations that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers or increase our cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to obtain adequate supply, we may be obligated to make payment to our customers for such shortfalls. Additionally, we place orders with our suppliers using our and our customers’ forecasts of customer demand, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates. As we move to smaller geometry process technologies, the manufacturing lead-time increases. As a result, the orders we place with our suppliers are generally only partially covered by commitments from our customers. If we, or our customers, overestimate customer demand that is not under a binding commitment from our customer, we may experience increased excess or obsolete inventory, which would negatively impact our results of operations.Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business.From time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright and other intellectual property rights against our products or products using our technologies or other technologies used in our industry. These claims have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such litigation given, among other factors, the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products or services were found to infringe another company’s intellectual property rights, we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our products or services, which could be costly, or to license such rights or pay damages or other compensation to such other company. If we are unable to redesign our products or services, license such intellectual property rights used in our products or services or otherwise distribute our products (e.g., through a licensed supplier), we could be prohibited from making and selling such products or providing such services. Similarly, our suppliers could be found to infringe another company’s intellectual property rights, and such suppliers could then be enjoined from providing products or services to us.In any potential dispute involving us and another company’s patents or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products or services sold or provided by us, or by intellectual property provided by us to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees’ sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delays, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.We may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary 29damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (or on the sale of our customers’ devices using such products) or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our chipset customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our worldwide chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees’ sales to wireless operators, causing corresponding declines in our chipset or licensing revenues.Certain legal matters, which may include certain claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property, are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”We may engage in strategic acquisitions, transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.We engage in strategic acquisitions and other transactions, including joint ventures, and make investments, which we believe are important to the future of our business, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. From time to time, we acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology, wireless spectrum and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions and purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies, including those that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our products and technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services) for voice and data communications and new industry segments. Many of our strategic activities entail a high degree of risk and require the use of significant amounts of capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies, products or services. We may underestimate the costs or overestimate the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership interests. In addition, we may record impairment charges related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited.Achieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions, including joint ventures and other strategic investments in which we have management and operational control, depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, technology, products, processes, operations (including manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers and suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development and supply operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not derive any commercial value from associated technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these technologies, and we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain, and we may become subject to litigation. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sales or distribution channels, business or operational models (including manufacturing), geographic regions, industry segments or categories of products served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of the combination.If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions or other strategic activities, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transactions.Many of our acquisitions and other strategic investments require approval by the United States and/or foreign government agencies. Certain agencies in the past have, and may in the future, deny the transaction or fail to approve in a timely manner, resulting in us not realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction. Future acquisitions or other strategic investments may be more difficult, complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed. Further, if U.S./China trade relations remain strained, our ability to consummate any transaction that would require approval from the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) in China may be severely impacted. 30We are subject to various laws, regulations, policies and standards. Our business may suffer as a result of existing, new or amended laws, regulations, policies or standards, or our failure or inability to comply with laws, regulations, policies or standards.Our business, products and services, and those of our customers and licensees, are subject to various laws and regulations globally, as well as government policies and the specifications of international, national and regional communications standards bodies. Compliance with existing laws, regulations, policies and standards, the adoption of new laws, regulations, policies or standards, changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, policies or standards, changes in the regulation of our activities by a government or standards body or rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such laws, regulations, policies or standards, including, among others, those affecting licensing practices, competitive business practices, the use of our technology or products, protection of intellectual property, trade and trade protection including tariffs, cybersecurity, foreign currency, investments or loans, spectrum availability and license issuance, adoption of standards, the provision of device subsidies by wireless operators to their customers, taxation, export control, privacy and data protection, environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, human rights, corporate governance, public disclosure or business conduct, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.Government policies, particularly in China, that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of a country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of and/or ability to receive payments from our customers and licensees in such countries, which may negatively impact our cash flows.Further, China has implemented, and other countries or regions may implement, cybersecurity laws that require that our overall information technology security environment meet certain standards and/or to be certified. Such laws may be complex, ambiguous and subject to interpretation, which may create uncertainty regarding compliance. As a result, our efforts to comply with such laws may be expensive and may fail, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. Delays in government approvals or other governmental activities that could result from, among others, a decrease in or a lack of funding for certain agencies or branches of the government, trade or national security protection policies, or political changes, could result in our incurring higher costs, could negatively impact our ability to timely consummate strategic transactions and could have other negative impacts on our business and the businesses of our customers and licensees.Import/export regulations, such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce, are complex, change frequently, have generally become more stringent over time and have intensified under the current U.S. administration. If our customers or suppliers fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to suspend activities with these customers or suppliers, which could negatively impact our results of operations. Additionally, we may be required to incur significant expense to comply with, or to remedy violations of, these regulations.National, state and local environmental laws and regulations affect our operations around the world. These laws may make it more expensive to manufacture, have manufactured and sell products, and our costs could increase if our vendors (e.g., suppliers, third-party manufacturers or utility companies) pass on their costs to us. The imposition of tariffs on raw materials or our products could also have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations. We are also subject to laws and regulations impacting our manufacturing operations. See the Risk Factor entitled “There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model, environmental compliance and liability, exposure to natural disasters, timely supply of equipment and materials, and various manufacturing issues.”Regulations in the United States require that we determine whether certain materials used in our products, referred to as conflict minerals, originated in the Democratic Republic of the Congo or an adjoining country (collectively, the Covered Countries), or were from recycled or scrap sources. Other countries and regions are imposing similar regulations, which may require us to undertake additional verification and reporting, including regarding countries in addition to the Covered Countries and minerals in addition to conflict minerals. The verification and reporting requirements, in addition to customer demands for conflict free sourcing, impose additional costs on us and on our suppliers and may limit the sources or increase the prices of materials used in our products. Further, if we are unable to determine that the conflict minerals used in our products do not directly or indirectly finance or benefit armed groups in the Covered Countries, we may face challenges with our customers that place us at a competitive disadvantage, and our reputation may be harmed. Similarly, other laws and regulations have been adopted or proposed that require additional transparency regarding the employment practices of our suppliers, and any failure to maintain responsible sourcing practices could also adversely affect our relationships with customers and our reputation. 31Laws, regulations, policies and standards are complex and changing and may create uncertainty regarding compliance. Laws, regulations, policies and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases, and their application in practice may evolve over time. As a result, our efforts to comply may fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. Failure to comply with any law, regulation, policy or standard may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. New laws, regulations, policies and standards or evolving interpretations of legal requirements may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies or procedures and may divert management time and attention to compliance activities.Our use of open source software may harm our business.Certain of our software and our suppliers’ software may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, and we have seen, and believe we will continue to see, an increase in customers requesting that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of a product’s source code and may expose related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of the open source software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Furthermore, in the course of product development, we may make contributions to third party open source projects that could obligate our intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. For example, to encourage the growth of a software ecosystem that is interoperable with our products, we may need to contribute certain implementations under the open source licensing terms that govern such projects, which may adversely impact certain of our associated intellectual property. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property rights upon which our licensing business depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights. Also, our use and our customers’ use of open source software may subject our products and our customers’ products to governmental scrutiny and delays in product certification, which could cause customers to view our products as less desirable than our competitors’ products. While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property rights, our contributions to and use of open source software presents risks that could have an adverse effect on these rights and on our business.We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns that may adversely impact our business. Our stock price, earnings and the fair value of our investments are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to this dynamic and others, and to market downturns generally.The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles (for both semiconductors and for many of the products in which they are used) and fluctuations in product supply and demand. From time to time, these factors, together with changes in general economic conditions, cause significant upturns and downturns in the semiconductor industry. Periods of downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, periods of inventory adjustment, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and erosion of average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to cyclical downturns, even when overall economic conditions are relatively stable. If we cannot offset semiconductor industry or market downturns, our revenues may decline, and our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.Our stock price and earnings have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock and earnings include those identified above and throughout this Risk Factors section; volatility of the stock market in general and technology-based and semiconductor companies in particular; announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers or licensees; and variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors, among others. Further, increased volatility in the financial markets and overall economic conditions may reduce the amounts that we realize in the future on our cash equivalents and marketable securities and may reduce our earnings as a result of any reductions in the fair values of marketable securities.In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities. Due to changes in our stock price, we are and may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s attention and our resources. Certain legal matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” 32There are risks associated with our indebtedness and our significant stock repurchase program.Our outstanding indebtedness and any additional indebtedness we incur may have negative consequences on our business, including, among others:•requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes;•limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends or general corporate or other purposes;•limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, our industry and the market; and•increasing our vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations to the extent a portion of our debt has variable interest rates.Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to economic and political conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, including factors which negatively impact our cash flows, such as licensees withholding some or all of the royalty payments they owe to us or our paying fines or modifying our business practices in connection with regulatory investigations or litigation, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; reduce or eliminate our dividend payments; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such refinancing or restructuring would increase. If there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt in the future and the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.Our current outstanding variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past. We expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be created and implemented prior to the 2021 target date. Fallback provisions are being written into LIBOR-based contracts to attempt to reduce the risk of sudden and unpredictable increases in the cost of variable rate indebtedness. However, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments. We have implemented a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to $30 billion of our outstanding common stock. This stock repurchase program has significantly reduced and will continue to reduce the amount of cash that we have available to fund our operations, including research and development, working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, investments, dividends and other corporate purposes; and increases our exposure to adverse economic, market, industry and competitive conditions and developments, and other changes in our business and our industry. In addition, this significant decrease in our cash reserves exacerbates the risks described above associated with our indebtedness.Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our information technology systems, or other misappropriation of our intellectual property or proprietary or confidential information.Third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, and most of such attempts are increasingly more sophisticated. These attempts, which might be related to industrial or other espionage, criminal hackers or state-sponsored intrusions, include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers and networks, including those in our manufacturing operations, and impersonating authorized users, among others. In addition, third party suppliers that we may rely on to store and/or process our confidential information may also be subject to similar attacks. Such attempts could result in the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure or loss or destruction of the intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, as well as damage to or disruptions in our information technology systems. These threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures.We seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems may be successful, and in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. The misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure or loss or destruction of the intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, cause us to lose business, damage our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings, cause us to incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our information technology systems. 33In addition, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, customers or licensees, may misappropriate, use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties our intellectual property or proprietary or confidential business information. This risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire our employees. See the Risk Factor entitled “We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.” Similarly, we provide access to certain of our intellectual property or proprietary or confidential business information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees and certain of our consultants, who may wrongfully use such intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors.Potential tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly are subject to examination of our tax returns and reports by taxing authorities in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, most notably in countries where we earn a routine return and the tax authorities believe substantial value-add activities are performed. Our current examinations are at various stages with respect to assessments, claims, deficiencies and refunds. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, income taxes payable and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts giving rise to a revision become known. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In such case, our income tax provision, results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made could be negatively affected.The United States Treasury Department has issued proposed regulations on several provisions of the Tax Legislation, including foreign tax credits, FDII, BEAT and interest expense deduction limitations, which are expected to be finalized in the next several months. When finalized, these proposed regulations may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flows.We have tax incentives in Singapore provided that we meet specified employment and other criteria, and as a result of the expiration of these incentives, our Singapore tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal 2022 and again in fiscal 2027. If we do not meet the criteria required to retain such incentives, our Singapore tax rate could increase prior to fiscal 2022, and our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.Tax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business. Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to transfer pricing. These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows. Partially to address BEPS, we moved certain IP from Singapore to the United States. As a result, if tax rates were to increase in the United States, our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.Global, regional or local economic conditions, or political actions including trade and/or national security protection policies, such as tariffs, that impact the mobile communications industry or the other industries in which we operate could negatively affect the demand for our products and services and our customers’ or licensees’ products and services, which may negatively affect our revenues.A decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, a slow-down in economic growth, political actions including trade and/or national security protection policies, such as tariffs, or actions by governments that limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain companies or that limit or prevent certain companies from transacting business with us, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or licensees, could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on demand for our products and services and for the products and services of our customers or licensees, particularly equipment manufacturers or others in the wireless communications industry who buy their products, such as wireless operators. Any prolonged economic downturn or “trade war” may result in a decrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products of our customers or licensees; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our licensees or customers; failures by counterparties; and negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers’ ability to purchase or pay for our products and services and network operators’ ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be adversely affected by economic conditions, leading to a reduction, cancelation or delay of orders for our products and services. 34We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.Our future success depends largely upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees, including by establishing local offices near our headquarters in San Diego, California. A number of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and are able to offer compensation in excess of what we are able to offer. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.Currency fluctuations could negatively affect future product sales or royalty revenues, harm our ability to collect receivables or increase the U.S. dollar cost of our products.Our customers sell their products throughout the world in various currencies. Our consolidated revenues from international customers and licensees accounted for a significant portion of our total revenues in each of the last three fiscal years. Adverse movements in currency exchange rates may negatively affect our business, revenues, results of operations and cash flows due to a number of factors, including, among others:•Our products and those of our customers and licensees that are sold outside the United States may become less price-competitive, which may result in reduced demand for those products or downward pressure on average selling prices; •Certain of our revenues that are derived from products that are sold in foreign currencies could decrease, resulting in lower revenues, cash flows and margins; •Certain of our revenues, such as royalties, that are derived from licensee or customer sales denominated in foreign currencies could decrease, resulting in lower revenues and cash flows;•Our foreign suppliers may raise their prices if they are impacted by currency fluctuations, resulting in higher than expected costs, and lower margins and cash flows; •Certain of our costs that are denominated in foreign currencies could increase, resulting in higher than expected costs and cash outflows; and•Foreign exchange hedging exposes us to counterparty risk and may require the payment of structuring fees. If the foreign exchange hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge results may cause earnings volatility. The foreign exchange hedging activities are designed to lessen earnings volatility; therefore, hedges may reduce the impact of currency fluctuations to certain revenues and costs.Failures in our products or services, or in the products or services of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.The use of devices containing our products to interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. While we continue to focus on this issue and are taking measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities continue to evolve, enabling more elaborate functionality and applications, and increasing the risk of security failures. Further, our products are inherently complex and may contain defects or errors that are detected only when the products are in use. Development of products and features in new domains of technology and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes are complex, add risk to manufacturing yields and reliability and increase the likelihood of product defects or errors. Because our products and services are responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products and networks, security failures, defects or errors in our products or services could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and the end users of our customers’ products. Such adverse impact could include shipment delays; write-offs of our inventories, property, plant and equipment and intangible assets; unfavorable purchase commitments; a shift of business to our competitors; a decrease in demand for connected devices and wireless services; damage to our reputation and our customer relationships; regulatory actions; and other financial liability or harm to our business. In addition, security failures, defects or errors in the products of our customers or licensees could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows due to a delay or decrease in demand for our products or services generally, and our premium-tier products in particular, among other factors. Further, failures, defects or errors in our products or those of our customers or licensees entail the risk of product liability claims or recalls. 35Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2. PropertiesAt September 29, 2019, we occupied the following facilities (square footage in millions): United States Other Countries TotalOwned facilities4.4 0.4 4.8Leased facilities0.9 5.3 6.2Total5.3 5.7 11.0Our headquarters as well as certain research and development, manufacturing and network management hub operations are located in San Diego, California. Additionally, our QCT segment’s non-United States headquarters is located in Singapore. Our QCT segment also operates leased manufacturing facilities in Germany, China and Singapore. We also own and lease properties around the world for use as sales and administrative offices and research and development centers, primarily in the United States and India. Our facility leases expire at varying dates through 2032, not including renewals that are at our option. Several other owned and leased facilities are under construction totaling approximately 1.3 million additional square feet, primarily related to the construction of new facilities in India and a new manufacturing facility in Singapore.We believe that our facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes and that the productive capacity in facilities that are not under construction is substantially utilized. We do not identify or allocate facilities by operating segment. Additional information on net property, plant and equipment by geography is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.” In the future, we may need to purchase, build or lease additional facilities to meet the requirements projected in our long-term business plan.Item 3. Legal and Regulatory ProceedingsInformation regarding legal and regulatory proceedings is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We are also engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business and, while there can be no assurance, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Item 4. Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable. 36Part IIItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket Information and DividendsOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol “QCOM.” At November 4, 2019, there were 6,683 holders of record of our common stock. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital requirements, including those relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales and distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, legal risks, withholding of payments by one or more of our significant licensees and/or customers, fines by government agencies and/or adverse rulings by a court or arbitrator in a legal matter, stock repurchase programs, debt issuances, changes in federal and state income tax law and changes to our business model.Share-Based CompensationWe primarily issue restricted stock units under our equity compensation plans, which are part of a broad-based, long-term retention program that is intended to attract and retain talented employees and directors and align stockholder and employee interests.Our 2016 Long-Term Incentive Plan (2016 Plan) provides for the grant of both incentive and nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, unrestricted stock, restricted stock units, performance units, performance shares, deferred compensation awards and other stock-based awards. Restricted stock units generally vest over periods of three years from the date of grant. Stock options vest over periods not exceeding five years and are exercisable for up to ten years from the grant date. The Board of Directors may amend or terminate the 2016 Plan at any time, with certain amendments also requiring stockholder approval.Additional information regarding our share-based compensation plans and plan activity for fiscal 2019, 2018 and 2017 is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 5. Employee Benefit Plans.”Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesIssuer purchases of equity securities during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 were: Total Number ofShares Purchased Average Price Paid Per Share (1) Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet BePurchased Under the Plans or Programs (2) (In thousands) (In thousands) (In millions)July 1, 2019 to July 28, 20192,368 $76.01 2,368 $7,589July 29, 2019 to August 25, 20192,502 71.94 2,502 7,409August 26, 2019 to September 29, 2019 Other repurchases4,489 77.07 4,489 7,063Accelerated share repurchases (3)68,682 68,682 7,063Total78,041 78,041 (1)Average Price Paid Per Share excludes cash paid for commissions.(2)On July 26, 2018, we announced a repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $30 billion of our common stock. At September 29, 2019, $7.1 billion remained authorized for repurchase. The stock repurchase program has no expiration date. Since September 29, 2019, we repurchased and retired 3.9 million shares of common stock for $300 million. Shares withheld to satisfy statutory tax withholding requirements related to the vesting of share-based awards are not issued or considered stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and, therefore, are excluded from the table above.(3)In September 2018, we entered into three accelerated share repurchase agreements (ASR Agreements) to repurchase an aggregate of $16.0 billion of our common stock. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, 178.4 million shares were initially delivered to us under the ASR Agreements and were retired. The ASR Agreements were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, and an 37additional 68.7 million shares were delivered to us and were retired, comprising the final delivery of shares under the ASR Agreements. In total, 247.1 million shares were delivered to us under the ASR Agreements at an average price per share of $64.76. 38Item 6. Selected Financial DataThe following data should be read in conjunction with the annual consolidated financial statements, related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere herein. We have revised our prior period financial statements for the years ended September 30, 2018 and September 24, 2017 to reflect the correction of an immaterial error as described in this Annual Report in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, “Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 12.

The fiscal year ended September 29, 2019, September 24, 2017, September 25, 2016 and September 27, 2015 each included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended September 30, 2018 included 53 weeks.(2)Revenues in fiscal 2019 included $4.7 billion resulting from the settlement with Apple and its contract manufacturers. Revenues in fiscal 2019 also reflected the impact of the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance in the first quarter of fiscal 2019. Operating income in fiscal 2019 was impacted by a $275 million charge attributed to a fine imposed by the European Commission (EC) and $213 million in net charges related to our Cost Plan. Additionally, net income for fiscal 2019 was impacted by a $2.5 billion charge to income tax expense resulting from the derecognition of a deferred tax asset related to the distributed intellectual property and a tax benefit of $570 million due to establishing new U.S. net deferred tax assets from making certain check-the-box elections.Revenues in fiscal 2018 were negatively impacted by our prior dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers, partially offset by $600 million paid under an interim agreement with Huawei. Operating income in fiscal 2018 was further impacted by a $2.0 billion charge related to a fee in connection with the termination of a purchase agreement to acquire NXP Semiconductors N.V., a $1.2 billion charge related to a fine imposed by the EC and $629 million in charges related to our Cost Plan, partially offset by a $676 million benefit resulting from a settlement with the Taiwan Fair Trade Commission (TFTC). Additionally, net loss for fiscal 2018 was impacted by the $5.7 billion charge related to the Tax Legislation.Revenues in fiscal 2017 were negatively impacted by actions taken by Apple and its contract manufacturers and Huawei, who did not fully report or fully pay royalties due in the last three quarters of fiscal 2017, as well as a $940 million reduction to revenues recorded related to the BlackBerry arbitration. Operating income was further impacted by $927 million and $778 million in charges related to the fines imposed by the Korea Fair Trade Commission and TFTC, respectively. (3)In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we announced a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $30 billion of our common stock. Under this program, we completed a tender offer and paid an aggregate of $5.1 billion to repurchase shares of our common stock and entered into three accelerated share repurchase agreements to repurchase an aggregate of $16.0 billion of our 39common stock, resulting in significant reductions to the balances of our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, total assets and total stockholders’ equity.(4)Short-term debt was comprised of outstanding commercial paper and, in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2017, the current portion of long-term debt.(5)Long-term debt was comprised of floating- and fixed-rate notes.(6)Other long-term liabilities in this balance sheet data includes non-current income taxes payable and excludes unearned revenues. 40Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsIn addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors, including but not limited to risks described in “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report.The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in “Part II,",2023-12-30 18:21:43.091282
804328,QCOM,QUALCOMM INC/DE,2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the “Our Business and Operating Segments” section under the heading “Seasonality.”13Corporate StructureWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax, contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering, research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a wholly-owned subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI’s subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.Revenue Concentrations and Significant CustomersA small number of customers/licensees historically have accounted for a significant portion of our consolidated revenues. In fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, revenues from Apple and its contract manufacturers, combined revenues from Guangdong OPPO Mobile Telecommunications Corp., Ltd. (Oppo) and BBK Communication Technology Co., Ltd. (vivo), and their respective affiliates (including BBK), Samsung and Xiaomi each comprised 10% or more of consolidated revenues. Revenues from Huawei also comprised 10% or more of consolidated revenues in fiscal 2020, which were positively impacted by the settlement of our prior dispute. Revenues in fiscal 2018 were negatively impacted by our prior dispute with Apple and its contract manufacturers. Additional information regarding the settlements is provided in this Annual Report in “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”Research and DevelopmentThe wireless communications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards, frequent new product introductions and, with the introduction of 5G, the expansion into new industry segments or applications such as automotive and IoT, requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and technologies and to develop new products and technologies. We have significant engineering resources, including engineers with substantial expertise in CDMA, OFDMA and a broad range of other technologies. Using these engineering resources, we expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products, and to utilize that research and development in adjacent industry segments or applications beyond mobile (such as automotive and IoT), including continuing the development of CDMA, OFDMA and other technologies (such as RFFE), developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies, and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world. Our research and development team has a demonstrated track record of innovation in voice and data communication technologies and application processor technology, among others.We continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in OFDMA-based technologies and products (including LTE and 5G). We also engage in acquisitions and other transactions, such as joint ventures, to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or open or expand opportunities for our technologies and to support the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products and services) for voice and data communications and new industry segments or applications beyond mobile. We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops, AR/VR/XR devices) and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G, 4G and 5G technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, location positioning and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other client software environments in our chipsets.We develop on our own, and with our partners, innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition.We have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world that support our global development activities and ongoing efforts to develop and/or advance 4G, 5G and a broad range of other technologies. We continue to use our substantial engineering resources and expertise to develop new technologies, applications and services and make them available to licensees to help grow the communications industry and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities.Sales and MarketingSales and marketing activities of our operating segments are discussed under Operating Segments. Other marketing activities include public relations, branding, digital marketing and social media, technical marketing, product marketing, participation in technical conferences and trade shows, development of use cases and white papers, competitive analyses and industry intelligence and other marketing programs, such as co-marketing with our customers or licensees. Our Corporate Marketing department provides information on our company website and through other channels regarding our products, strategies and technology to investors, industry analysts, media, prospective job applicants, consumers and others.14CompetitionCompetition faced by our operating segments is discussed under Operating Segments. Competition in the wireless communications industry throughout the world continues to increase at a rapid pace as consumers, businesses and governments realize the potential of wireless communications products and services.We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings and introduce new technologies and services in the future and as additional companies compete with our products and/or services based on 3G, 4G, 5G and/or other technologies. Although we intend to continue to make substantial investments in developing new products and technologies and improving existing products and technologies to strengthen and/or maintain our competitive position, our competitors may introduce alternative products, services or technologies that threaten our business. It is also possible that the prices we charge for our products and services may continue to decline as competition continues to intensify. See also the Risk Factor entitled “Our industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change. Our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; and such change and competition could result in decreased demand for our products and technologies or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our customers or licensees.”Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human CapitalFor decades, our innovations have helped transform industries, enhance the lives of billions of people and address some of society’s biggest challenges. With the world becoming increasingly connected, we have a tremendous opportunity to shape a better future. We believe in the power of technology. As such, our corporate responsibility vision is to be a facilitator of innovation for a sustainable world, connected wirelessly.ESGOur sustained investment in R&D has helped revolutionize the way people connect; our approach to innovation is strategic and purposeful. We understand that the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our world. We focus our efforts in four key areas where we believe we can have the biggest impact: •Responsible Business. We integrate responsible and sustainable practices throughout our organization. Our products are designed to not harm individuals, communities or the environment. We continually look for ways to conserve water, minimize energy consumption, lower emissions and reduce waste. Because privacy and security are critical for success in the wireless industry, we constantly seek to promote data protection across the mobile ecosystem.•Our People. We strive to make Qualcomm an inspiring and inclusive workplace to advance the development of leading-edge technologies. Our success is only possible with the hard work and dedication of our employees. We celebrate diversity among our workforce and recognize that our varied backgrounds, experiences and ideas are critical to innovation. We foster inclusive practices in our operations around the world in order to reflect the communities in which we do business. •Purposeful Innovation. We invent breakthrough technologies that enable life-changing products and experiences. We’re building on our legacy of technology leadership with 5G, which we believe will serve as the technological foundation for connected cars, industrial IoT, smart homes and cities, networking and mobility. We also work to broaden our impact by bringing advanced wireless technologies to underserved communities around the world. In doing so, we believe that we have enriched the lives of millions of people while creating new opportunities for our business.•STEM Education. We seek to inspire the next generation of inventors and advance workforce development for STEM-related careers (science, technology, engineering and mathematics). Our initiatives are designed to promote and improve STEM education at all levels and to expand opportunities for underrepresented students. We encourage you to review our March 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report (located on our Internet site at www.qualcomm.com) for more detailed information regarding our ESG programs and initiatives. Nothing on our website, including our Corporate Responsibility Report or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.Human Capital In order to continue to produce the innovative, breakthrough technologies for which we are known, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Qualcomm a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs, and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.At September 27, 2020, we had approximately 41,000 full-time, part-time and temporary employees, the overwhelming majority of which were full-time employees. During fiscal 2020, the number of employees increased by approximately 4,000, primarily due to increases in engineering resources. Our employees are represented by more than 100 self-identified nationalities working in over 150 locations in 32 different countries around the world. Collectively, we speak more than 60 different languages. Our global workforce is highly educated, with the substantial majority of our employees working in engineering or technical roles (many of whom help develop foundational technologies for both our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business). During fiscal 2020, our voluntary turnover rate was less than 5%, below the 15technology industry benchmark, which is comprised of certain of our key competitors (Aon, 2020 Salary Increase and Turnover Study — Second Edition, September 2020).Diversity and Inclusion. We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to focus on the hiring, retention and advancement of women and underrepresented populations. Our recent efforts have been focused in three areas: inspiring innovation through an inclusive and diverse culture; expanding our efforts to recruit and hire world-class diverse talent; and identifying strategic partners to accelerate our inclusion and diversity programs. We have a number of employee networks that enhance our inclusive and diverse culture, including those supporting Women, Africans and African Americans, Latinos, Veterans, the LGBTQ+ community and employees with disabilities. We continue to recruit technical talent in diverse communities, including by engaging as a high-level sponsor of professional conferences, such as the Grace Hopper Celebration, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers National Convention and the National Society of Black Engineers National Convention. We also continue to recruit from a variety of colleges including Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Women’s Colleges. Our continued engagement with organizations that work with diverse communities has been vital to our efforts to increase women and minority representation in our workforce. For example, we partner with AnitaB.org to benchmark our progress and identify promising practices for recruiting, retaining and advancing women technologists and support its research initiatives related to attracting and retaining women and underrepresented minority students in computing majors. We, alongside other top technology companies, helped form the Reboot Representation Tech Coalition, which aims to double the number of Black, Latinx and Native American women receiving computing degrees by 2025. In collaboration with the National Foundation for Autism Research, we started an internship program to welcome those with autism into our Company. Through our collaboration with Disability:IN’s Inclusion Works program, we have increased our ability to address the needs of individuals with disabilities. In an effort to provide additional transparency into our efforts to increase underrepresented populations in our workforce, we intend to disclose our 2020 Consolidated EEO-1 Report after our submission of the report to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. From a governance perspective, our HR and Compensation Committee, through its charter, provides oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on workforce diversity and inclusion.Health, Safety and Wellness. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.Compensation and Benefits. We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include annual bonuses, stock awards, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, a 401(k) Plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption and surrogacy assistance, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance and on-site services, such as health centers and fitness centers, among many others. In addition to our broad-based equity award programs, we have used targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical engineering skills and experience.Talent Development. We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a world-leading wireless innovator. We deliver numerous training opportunities, provide rotational assignment opportunities, have expanded our focus on continuous learning and development, and implemented “industry-leading” methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop talent.Our talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We provide a series of employee workshops around the globe that support professional growth and development. Additionally, our manager and employee forum programs provide an ongoing opportunity for employees to practice and apply learning around conversations aligned with our annual review process. We also have an employee development website that provides quick access to learning resources that are personalized to the individual's development needs.Building Connections — With Each Other and our Communities. We believe that building connections between our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Through our engagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteering and giving opportunities and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members. Leveraging our partnerships with various local 16arts and culture organizations, we have created numerous unique experiences for employees and their families around the world. Since our employees are passionate about many causes, our corporate giving and volunteering programs support and encourage employees by engaging with those causes. In our offices around the world, our employee-led Giving Committees select local organizations to support, often in the form of grants that are primarily funded by the Qualcomm Foundation (which was established in 2011 to support charitable giving and volunteerism). We also frequently collaborate with these organizations on volunteer activities for our employees. Additionally, during fiscal 2020, thousands of our employees around the world utilized our charitable match program, benefiting more than 1,500 charitable organizations.We encourage you to review the “Our People” section of our March 2020 Corporate Responsibility Report (located on our website) for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital programs and initiatives.

Risk FactorsYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects. However, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. In addition to the risks and uncertainties set forth in the Risk Factor below entitled “The recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we expect its impact will continue, at least in the near term,” many of the risks and uncertainties set forth in the other Risk Factors below are exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, government and business responses thereto and any further resulting decline in the global business and economic environment, and may be impacted by the extent and speed of the global economic recovery. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” References to “and,” “or” and “and/or” should be read to include the others, as appropriate.RISKS RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMICThe recent coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we expect its impact will continue, at least in the near term.The rapid, global spread of COVID-19 and the fear it has created has resulted in significant economic uncertainty, significant declines in business and consumer confidence and global demand in the wireless industry (among others), a global economic slowdown, and has led to a global recession. Specifically, the decline in demand for smartphones and other consumer devices sold by our customers or licensees has resulted in decreased demand for our integrated circuit products (which are incorporated into such devices) and a decrease in the royalties we earn on the licensing of our intellectual property (which is dependent upon the number of such devices sold that utilize our intellectual property). We expect that demand for our products and demand for the products of our customers and licensees will continue to be negatively impacted in the near term.Further, while to date we have not seen a significant impact on our manufacturing facilities or our supply chain, the ability of our suppliers to deliver on their commitments to us, or our ability to ship our products to our customers, may be negatively impacted by the pandemic and/or government responses thereto, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place and social distancing orders, declarations of states of emergency and shutdowns.Although the spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our workforce practices, such as having the vast majority of our employees working from home, we have not experienced a significant negative impact to our business or results of 18operations. However, we could be negatively affected in the future if, among others, a significant number of our employees, or employees who perform critical functions, become ill and/or are quarantined as the result of exposure to COVID-19, or if government policies restrict the ability of those employees to perform their critical functions.The COVID-19 pandemic could also impact our business, results of operations and financial condition through delayed, reduced or cancelled customer orders; the inability of our customers or licensees to purchase or pay for our products or technologies; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; or failures by other counterparties. Additionally, state or federal governments may in the future increase corporate tax rates, increase employer payroll tax obligations and/or otherwise change tax laws to pay for stimulus and other actions that may be taken as a result of COVID-19. The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our future business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are uncertain, including but not limited to the duration, spread and severity of the pandemic, government responses and other actions to mitigate the spread of and to treat COVID-19, and when and to what extent normal business, economic and social activity and conditions resume. We are similarly unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic impacts our customers, licensees, suppliers and other partners and their financial conditions, but adverse effects on these parties could also adversely affect us. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic makes it challenging for management to estimate the future performance of our business.RISKS RELATED TO INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND COMPETITIONOur revenues depend on our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, including 5G, and customer demand for our products based on these technologies.We develop, patent and commercialize technology and products based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, which are primarily wireless. We depend on our customers and licensees to develop devices and services based on these technologies with value-added features to drive consumer demand for new 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices, as well as 3G, 4G and 5G single-mode devices, and to establish the selling prices for such devices. Further, the timing of our shipment of our products is dependent on the timing of our customers’ and licensees’ deployments of new devices and services based on these technologies. Increasingly, we also depend on operators of wireless networks, our customers and licensees and other third parties to incorporate these technologies into new device types and into industries and applications beyond mobile, such as automotive and IoT, among others.We have historically been successful during wireless technology transitions, including 3G, 4G and now 5G. Commercial deployments of 5G networks and devices have begun and will continue. However, the timing and scale of such deployments, in certain regions, have been and may in the future be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.We believe it is critical that we remain a leader in 5G technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and technology licensing, and that we develop, commercialize and be a leading supplier of 5G integrated circuit products, in order to sustain and grow our business long-term.Our revenues and growth in revenues could be negatively impacted, our business may be harmed and our substantial investments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return, if our customers’ and licensees’ revenues and sales of products, particularly premium-tier products, and services using these technologies, and average selling prices of such products, decline due to, for example, the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed regions and China; our intellectual property and technical leadership included in the continued 5G standardization effort is less than in 3G and 4G standards; we are unable to drive the adoption of our products into networks and devices, including devices beyond mobile; or consumers’ rates of replacement of smartphones and other computing devices decline. Our industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change. Our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; and such change and competition could result in decreased demand for our products and technologies or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our customers or licensees.Our products and technologies face significant competition. We expect competition to increase as our current competitors expand their product offerings, improve their products or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to maintain existing business and customers or attract new business and customers, as new opportunities develop, and as new competitors enter the industry. Competition in wireless communications is affected by various factors that include, among others: OEM concentrations; vertical integration; competition in certain geographic regions; government intervention or support of national industries or competitors; the ability to maintain product differentiation as the result of evolving industry standards and speed of technological change (including the transition to smaller geometry process technologies and the demand for always on, always connected capabilities); and value-added features that drive selling prices and consumer demand for new 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices, as well as 3G and 4G single-mode devices.We anticipate that additional competitors will introduce products as a result of growth opportunities in wireless communications, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, and technological and public policy changes. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape. For example, if any key supplier of technologies and intellectual property to the semiconductor industry was sold to one of our competitors, it could negatively affect our ability to 19procure or license such technologies and intellectual property in the future, which could have wide-ranging impacts on our business and operations.We expect that our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:•differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features (e.g., modem, radio frequency front-end (RFFE), including mmWave, graphics and other processors, camera and connectivity) and with smaller geometry process technologies that drive both performance and lower power consumption;•develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points to effectively cover all geographic regions and all device tiers;•continue to be a leader in mobile, and drive the adoption of our technologies and integrated circuit products, including RFFE, into the most popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices in mobile, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and other mobile computing devices;•increase or accelerate adoption of our technologies and products in industry segments or applications outside of mobile, including automotive and IoT;•maintain or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit products at the premium device tier, while also driving the adoption of our products into high, mid- and low-tier devices across all regions;•remain a leader in 5G (and 4G) technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and develop, commercialize and remain a leading supplier of 5G (and 4G) integrated circuit products, including RFFE products; •create standalone value and contribute to the success of our existing businesses through acquisitions, joint ventures and other transactions, and by developing customer, licensee, vendor, distributor and other channel relationships in new industry segments or applications and with disruptive technologies and products; •identify potential acquisition targets that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic needs, reach agreement on terms acceptable to us, close the transactions and effectively integrate these new businesses, products and technologies; •provide leading products and technologies to OEMs, high level operating systems (HLOS) providers, operators, cloud providers and other industry participants as competitors, new industry entrants and other factors continue to affect the industry landscape;•be a preferred partner and sustain preferred relationships providing integrated circuit products that support multiple operating system and infrastructure platforms to industry participants that effectively commercialize new devices using these platforms; and•continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in computing and other consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging regions and China.We compete with many different semiconductor companies, ranging from multinational companies with integrated research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing organizations across a broad spectrum of product lines, to companies that are focused on a single application, industry segment or standard product, including those that produce products for mobile, automotive and IoT, among others. Most of these competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our businesses. Companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Broadcom, HiSilicon, MediaTek, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC (formally known as Spreadtrum Communications). Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to use our competitors’ integrated circuit products, to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products, or sell such products to others, or to utilize alternative technologies; lower cost structures or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies, competitors or OEMs that sell devices that do not contain our integrated circuit products; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and OEMs in certain geographic regions (such as China); more experience in adjacent industry segments or applications beyond mobile (such as automotive and IoT); and a more established presence in certain regions. In addition, certain of our largest integrated circuit customers have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize our competitors’ integrated circuit products in some (or all) of their devices, rather than our products. Further, certain of those customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products (effectively making them competitors), which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some (or all) of their devices, rather than our products. See also the Risk Factor entitled “Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).” Further, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or 20prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers or suppliers, limit, prevent or discourage certain of our customers or suppliers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so. This could advantage our competitors by enabling them with increased sales, economies of scale, operating income and/or cash flows and/or enable critical technology transfer, allowing them to increase their investments in technology development, research and development and commercialization of products. See also the Risk Factor entitled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.” Further, certain of our competitors develop and sell multiple components (including integrated circuit products) for use in devices and sell those components together to OEMs. Our competitors’ sales of multiple components put us (and our discrete integrated circuit products) at a competitive disadvantage. Certain of our competitors also develop and sell infrastructure equipment for wireless networks and can optimize their integrated circuit products to perform on such networks to a degree that we are not able to, which again puts us at a competitive disadvantage.Competition in any or all product tiers may result in the loss of business or customers, which would negatively impact our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Such competition may also reduce average selling prices for our chipset products or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging regions and China where competitors may have lower cost structures or may have a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins on their products. Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees’ products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues. RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSESWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Chinese OEMs continue to grow their device share in China and are increasing their device share in regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. In addition, a number of our largest integrated circuit customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products, or may choose our competitors’ integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some (or all) of their devices, rather than our products, which could significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor entitled “Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).”Further, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with some of our largest customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor entitled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.”In addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers’ feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.The loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by such customers or the cancelation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors’ integrated circuit products, government restrictions, the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations, and a delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development. Further, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers’ new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate. 21Apple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. Further, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.Our industry has also experienced, and we expect it will continue to experience, slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, lengthening replacement cycles in developed regions, where premium-tier smartphones are common; increasing consumer demand in emerging regions where premium-tier smartphones are less common and replacement cycles are on average longer than in developed regions and are continuing to lengthen; and a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles.A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), or a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development. Although we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a small number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees’ products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues. Such adverse impact may be mitigated by our per unit royalty caps that apply to certain categories of our licensees’ complete wireless devices, namely smartphones, tablets, laptops and smartwatches.Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).Certain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some (or all) of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us). Apple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors’ products in several of its recent device launches. In April 2019, we entered into a new multi-year chipset supply agreement with Apple and began shipping modems under this agreement in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel’s modem assets and is developing its own modem products using these assets. Accordingly, Apple is expected to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some (or all) of its future devices. Similarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. If some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some (or all) of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor entitled “We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.”A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in their devices and sell those devices into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.Due to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (including its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security 22policies, or other reasons, some of our Chinese integrated circuit customers have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices, or use our competitors’ integrated circuit products in their devices, rather than our products. Political actions, including trade protection and national security policies of the U.S. and Chinese governments, such as tariffs, bans or placing companies on restricted entity lists, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers, limit, prevent or discourage certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so. Given our revenue concentration in China, if, due to actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, we were further limited in, or prohibited from, obtaining critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China or selling our integrated circuit products to Chinese OEMs; if our non-Chinese OEM customers were limited in, or prohibited from, selling devices into China that incorporate our integrated circuit products; if Chinese OEMs develop and use their own integrated circuit products or use our competitors’ integrated circuit products in some (or all) of their devices rather than our integrated circuit products; if Chinese tariffs on our integrated circuit products or on devices which incorporate our integrated circuit products made purchasing such products or devices more expensive to Chinese OEMs or Chinese consumers; or if our Chinese licensees delay or cease making payments of license fees they owe us, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. Finally, government policies in China that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of the country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of, and/or ability to receive, payments from our customers and licensees in China, which may negatively impact our cash flows.RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR LICENSING BUSINESS Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business. From time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder’s ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to lower the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price on which the royalty is calculated.In addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.We have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below entitled “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or proceedings” and “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations or private legal proceedings challenging those practices, or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.” In addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments. Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance 23interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.Further, some companies or entities have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by severely limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies’) alleged failure to abide by these policies. Some SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party.We expect that such proposals, interpretations and strategies will continue in the future, and if successful, our business model would be harmed, either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalties (or by reducing the royalties we can collect) on all or a portion of our standard-essential patent portfolio, limiting our return on investment with respect to new technologies, limiting our ability to seek injunctions against infringers of our standard-essential patents, constraining our ability to make licensing commitments when submitting our technologies for inclusion in future standards (which could make our technologies less likely to be included in such standards) or forcing us to work outside of SDOs or other industry groups to promote our new technologies, and our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, the legal and other costs associated with asserting or defending our positions have been and continue to be significant. We expect that such challenges, regardless of their merits, will continue into the foreseeable future and will require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources.Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations or private legal proceedings challenging those practices, or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.As described in the Risk Factor “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or proceedings” below, we have been in the past and are currently subject to various governmental investigations and proceedings, as well as private legal proceedings, challenging our patent licensing and chipset sales practices. Certain of these matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We believe that one intent of certain of these investigations and legal proceedings has been to reduce the amount of royalties that licensees are required to pay to us for their use of our intellectual property. We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. If we were required to reduce the royalty rates in our patent license agreements, our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted absent a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid. Similarly, if we were required to reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted unless there was a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid or we were able to increase our royalty rates to offset the decrease in revenues resulting from such lower royalty base (assuming the absolute royalty dollars were below any relevant royalty caps).If we were required to grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers (which could lead to implementing a more complex, multi-level licensing structure in which we license certain portions of our patent portfolio to chipset manufacturers and other portions to OEMs), we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, and we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed. In addition, our licensing revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain, in the aggregate, equivalent revenues under such a multi-level licensing structure.If we were required to sell chipsets to OEMs that do not have a license to our patents, our licensing program could be negatively impacted by patent exhaustion claims raised by such unlicensed OEMs (i.e., claims that our sale of chipsets to such OEMs forecloses us from asserting any patents substantially embodied by the chipsets against such OEMs). Such sales would provide OEMs with a defense in the event we asserted our patents against them to obtain licensing revenue for those patents. This could have a material adverse effect on our licensing program and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.To the extent that we were required to implement any of these new licensing and/or business practices, including by modifying or renegotiating our existing license agreements or pursuing other commercial arrangements, we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed, and our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be harmed. The impact of any such changes to our licensing practices could vary widely and by jurisdiction, depending on the specific outcomes and the geographic scope of such outcomes. In addition, if we were required to make modifications to our licensing practices in one jurisdiction, licensees or governmental agencies in other jurisdictions may attempt to obtain similar outcomes for themselves or for such other jurisdictions, as applicable.24The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring or to cover additional future patents.We own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G, 5G and other technologies. It is critical that we continue to evolve our patent portfolio, particularly in 5G. If we do not maintain a strong portfolio that is applicable to current and future standards, products and services, our future licensing revenues could be negatively impacted.Further, the licenses granted to and from us under a number of our license agreements include only patents that are either filed or issued prior to a certain date. As a result, there are agreements with some licensees where later patents are not licensed by or to us. Additionally, our patent license agreements in effect that constitute a significant portion of our licensing revenues are effective for a specified term. In order to license or to obtain a license to such later patents or after the expiration of the specified term, and to receive royalties after the expiration date of the specified term, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees more frequently than we have done historically. We might not be able to extend or modify license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, in the future without negatively affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees, and such modifications or new agreements may negatively impact our revenues. In some circumstances, we may extend, modify or enter into new license agreements as a result of arbitration or litigation, and terms imposed by arbitrators or courts may be less favorable to us than existing terms and may impact the financial or other terms of license agreements not subject to the litigation or arbitration. If there is a delay in extending, modifying or entering into a new license agreement with a licensee, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize revenues related to that licensee’s product sales. Further, if we are unable to reach agreement on such modifications or new agreements, it could result in patent infringement litigation with such companies.RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL CHALLENGES Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or proceedings.We have been in the past and are currently subject to various governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” Key allegations or findings in those matters include, among others, that we violate FRAND licensing commitments by refusing to grant licenses to chipset manufacturers; that our royalty rates are too high; that the base on which our royalties are calculated should be something less than the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of the applicable device (minus certain permitted deductions); that we unlawfully require customers to execute a patent license before we sell them cellular modem chipsets; that we have entered into exclusive agreements with chipset customers that foreclose competition; that we leverage our position in baseband chipsets in the RFFE space; and that we violate antitrust laws, engage in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition. We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Depending on the matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patents; injunctions; monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money; the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices, such as requiring us to reduce our royalty rates, reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers, sell chipsets to unlicensed OEMs or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreements; and determinations that some or all of our license agreements are invalid or unenforceable. If some or all of our license agreements are declared invalid or unenforceable and/or we are required to renegotiate these license agreements, we may not receive, or may not be able to recognize, some or any licensing or royalty revenues under the impacted license agreements unless and until we enter into new license agreements; and even licensees whose license agreements are not impacted may demand to renegotiate their agreements or invoke the dispute resolution provision in their agreements, and we may not be able to recognize some or any licensing or royalty revenues under such agreements. The renegotiation of license agreements could result in terms which are less favorable to us than existing terms, or lead to arbitration or litigation to resolve the licensing terms, which could also be less favorable to us than existing terms, and each of which could take months or possibly years. Licensees may underreport, underpay, not report or not pay royalties owed to us pending the conclusion of such negotiations, arbitration or litigation. In addition, we may be sued for alleged overpayments of past royalties paid to us, including private antitrust actions seeking treble damages under U.S. antitrust laws. The occurrence of any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and our stock price could decline, possibly significantly, in which case we may have to significantly cut costs and other uses of cash, including in research and development, significantly impairing our ability to maintain product and technology leadership and invest in next generation technologies such as 5G. Further, depending on the breadth and severity of the circumstances above, we may have to reduce, suspend or eliminate our capital return programs, and our ability to timely pay our indebtedness may be impacted. In addition, a governmental body in a particular country or region may successfully assert and impose remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. These challenges have required, and we expect that they will continue to require, the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted, and we expect that they will continue to result, in significant legal costs until the respective matters are resolved. 25RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.We primarily utilize a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Other than the facilities we own that manufacture certain of our RFFE modules and RF filter products, we rely on third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. There are a limited number of such third-party suppliers, and even fewer who are capable of manufacturing at the leading process technology nodes. We employ both turnkey and two-stage manufacturing models to purchase our integrated circuits. Under the turnkey model, our foundry suppliers are responsible for delivering fully assembled and tested integrated circuits. Under the two-stage manufacturing model, we purchase die in singular or wafer form from semiconductor manufacturing foundries and contract with separate third-party suppliers for manufacturing services such as wafer bump, probe, assembly and the majority of our final test requirements. The semiconductor manufacturing foundries that supply our products are primarily located in Asia, as are our primary warehouses where we store finished goods for fulfillment of customer orders. The following could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively impact our revenues, business operations, profitability and cash flows:•a reduction, interruption, delay or limitation in our product supply sources;•a failure by our suppliers to procure raw materials or allocate adequate raw materials for our products;•a failure by our suppliers to allocate adequate manufacturing or test capacity for our products;•our suppliers’ inability to react to shifts in product demand or an increase in raw material or component prices;•our suppliers’ inability to develop or maintain, or a delay in developing or building out manufacturing capacity for leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies;•the loss of a supplier or the inability of a supplier to meet performance, quality or yield specifications or delivery schedules; •additional expense or production delays as a result of qualifying a new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of, or a decision to add or change, a supplier;•natural disasters or geopolitical conflicts impacting our suppliers; •health crises, including epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and government and business responses thereto, which impact our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines or closure; and•trade or national security protection policies, particularly U.S. or Chinese government policies, that limit or prevent us from transacting business with suppliers of critical integrated circuit products, or that limit or prevent such suppliers from transacting business with us or from procuring materials, machinery or technology necessary to manufacture goods for us.While we have established alternate suppliers for certain technologies, there are a limited number of such suppliers, and even fewer who are capable of operating at the leading process technology nodes. We rely on sole- or limited-source suppliers for certain products, which may exacerbate the aforementioned risks or subject us to other significant risks, including: poor product performance and reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing capability and yields, quality assurance, quantity and costs. To the extent we have established alternate suppliers, these suppliers may require significant levels of time and support to bring such technologies to production, both of which may increase for complex or leading process technologies. As a result, we may invest a significant amount of effort and resources and incur higher costs to support and maintain such alternate suppliers. Further, any future consolidation of foundry suppliers, or limitation in a foundry supplier’s ability to manufacture products for us due to trade or national security protection policies, could increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and reduce our suppliers’ willingness to negotiate pricing, which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reductions and could increase our manufacturing costs, and limit the amount of capacity available to us. Our arrangements with our suppliers may obligate us to incur costs to manufacture and test our products that do not decrease at the same rate as decreases in pricing to our customers. Our ability, and that of our suppliers, to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies (which adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability), and to effectively compete with the manufacturing processes and performance of our competitors, could impact our ability to introduce new products and meet customer demand, could increase our costs (possibly decreasing our margins) and could subject us to the risk of excess inventories. Any of the above could negatively impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.Although we have long-term contracts with our suppliers, most of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our suppliers over a specific time period or for any 26specific quantity, our suppliers may allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the production and testing of products for their other customers while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture or test our products, and such capacity may be limited based on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to invest in the capital required to manufacture in the leading process technologies. Accordingly, capacity for our products may not be available when we need it or at reasonable prices. To the extent we do obtain long-term capacity commitments, we may incur additional costs related to those commitments or make non-refundable payments for capacity commitments that are not used.Our suppliers or potential alternate suppliers may manufacture CDMA- or OFDMA-based integrated circuits, for themselves or for other companies, that compete with our products. Such suppliers have in the past and could again elect to allocate raw materials and manufacturing capacity to their own products or products of our competitors and reduce or limit the production of our products.In addition, we may not receive reasonable pricing, manufacturing or delivery terms from our suppliers. We cannot guarantee that the actions of our suppliers will not cause disruptions in our operations that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers or increase our cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to obtain adequate supply, we may be obligated to make payment to our customers for such shortfalls. Additionally, we place orders with our suppliers using our and our customers’ forecasts of demand for our products, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates. As we move to smaller geometry process technologies, the manufacturing lead-time increases. As a result, the orders we place with our suppliers are generally only partially covered by commitments from our customers. If we, or our customers, overestimate demand, or if demand is impacted by factors outside of our or our customers’ control, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, that is not under a binding commitment from our customers, we may experience increased excess or obsolete inventory, which would negatively impact our results of operations.There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model, environmental compliance and liability, impacts related to climate change, exposure to natural disasters, timely supply of equipment and materials, and various manufacturing issues.We own and operate various facilities that manufacture certain of our RFFE modules and RF filter products. Manufacturing facilities are characterized by a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model. We may be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products, including in less favorable industry environments. During such periods, our manufacturing facilities could operate at lower capacity levels, while the fixed costs associated with such facilities would continue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit.We are subject to many environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate our manufacturing facilities, which govern, among other things, emissions of pollutants into the air; wastewater discharges; the use, storage, generation, handling and disposal of hazardous substances and other waste; the investigation and remediation of soil and ground water contamination; and the health and safety of our employees. Certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property, or parties who arranged for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities, for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances. As a result, we may incur clean-up costs in connection with any such removal or remediation efforts, as well as other third-party claims in connection with contaminated sites. In addition, we could be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. If we, or companies or facilities we acquire or have acquired, in the past failed or in the future fail to comply with any such laws and regulations, then we could incur liabilities, fines or prohibitions on the sale of products we manufacture, and our operations could be suspended. Such laws and regulations could also restrict our ability to modify or expand our facilities, could require us to acquire costly equipment, or could require other significant expenditures. We are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. While we have policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations and permits, we cannot make assurances that we, or our employees, contractors or agents, will at all times be in compliance with such laws, regulations and permits, or our related policies and procedures.Climate change concerns and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may affect us, our suppliers and our customers. Such laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, climate change may pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, including increased extreme weather events that could result in supply delays or disruptions.We have manufacturing facilities in Asia and Europe. If tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions or other natural disasters, effects of climate change or geopolitical conflicts, were to damage, destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facilities, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments of inventory and result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs. In addition, natural disasters, effects of climate change or geopolitical conflicts may result in disruptions in transportation, distribution channels and supply chains, and significant increases in the prices of raw materials. Further, health crises, including epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and government and business responses thereto, could affect our manufacturing facilities, including by resulting in quarantines and/or closures, which would result in disruptions to and potential closures of our manufacturing operations.27Our manufacturing operations depend on securing raw materials and other supplies in adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner from multiple suppliers, and in some cases, we rely on a limited number of suppliers, particularly in Asia. Accordingly, there may be cases where supplies of raw materials and other products are interrupted by disaster, accident or some other event at a supplier, supply is suspended due to quality or other issues, or there is a shortage of supply due to a rapid increase in demand, among others, which could impact production and prevent us from supplying our products to our customers. If the supply-demand balance is disrupted, it may considerably increase costs of manufacturing due to increased prices we pay for raw materials. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Additionally, supply and costs of raw materials may be negatively impacted by trade and/or national security protection policies, such as tariffs, or actions by governments that limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain companies or that limit or prevent certain companies from transacting business with us, or trade tensions, particularly with countries in Asia. Further, it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another. A failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations.Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production, and as a result, we may not be able to deliver our products or do so in a timely, cost-effective or competitive manner. Further, to remain competitive and meet customer demand, we may be required to improve our facilities and process technologies and carry out extensive research and development, each of which may require investment of significant amounts of capital and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Finally, we typically begin manufacturing our products using our or our customers’ forecasts of demand for our products, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates and are generally not covered by purchase commitments. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, which sales ultimately may not materialize or may be lower than expected. If we or our customers overestimate demand, or if demand is impacted by factors outside of our or our customers’ control such as the COVID-19 pandemic or trade or national security protection policies, that is not under a binding commitment from our customers, we may experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and/or increased excess or obsolete inventory, which would negatively impact our results of operations. RISKS RELATED TO NEW AND ADJACENT INITIATIVES Our growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and adjacent industry segments or applications beyond mobile. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industry segments or applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.While we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies, we also invest in new and expanded product areas, and adjacent industry segments or applications, by utilizing our existing technical and business expertise and through acquisitions.In particular, our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and adjacent industry segments or applications beyond mobile, such as automotive and IoT; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies and products for new and expanded product areas, adjacent industry segments or applications; and third parties incorporating our technologies and products into devices used in these product areas, industry segments or applications. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments or applications, and in developing new products and technologies for these product areas, industry segments or applications. Our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent 5G technologies, and to develop and commercialize products using 5G technologies.However, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas and adjacent industry segments or applications, and corresponding technologies and products, as well as in our existing, technologies and products and new technologies, such as 5G, use of licensed, shared and unlicensed spectrum and convergence of cellular and Wi-Fi, may not succeed because, among other reasons: we may not be issued patents on the technologies we develop; the technologies we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standards; new and expanded product areas, adjacent industry segments or applications, and consumer demand therein, may not develop or grow as anticipated; our strategies or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be successful; alternate technologies may be better or may reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors’ technologies or products may be more cost effective, have more capabilities or fewer limitations or are brought to market faster than our new technologies or products; we may not be able to develop, or our competitors may have more established and/or stronger, customer, vendor, distributor or other channel relationships; and competitors may have longer operating histories in industry segments or applications that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of or overestimate the future revenues or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns. Further, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in significant barriers to entry and increased costs.28If our new technologies and products are not successful, or are not successful in the time frames we anticipate, we may incur significant costs and asset impairments, our business and revenues may not grow or grow as anticipated, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted, our stock price may decline and our reputation may be harmed.We may engage in strategic acquisitions and other transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.We engage in strategic acquisitions and other transactions, including joint ventures, and make investments, which we believe are important to the future of our business, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. From time to time, we acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions and purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies, including those that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our products and technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products (or enhancing existing products) for mobile, and for new industry segments or applications beyond mobile. Many of our strategic activities entail a high degree of risk and require the use of significant amounts of capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or products. We may underestimate the costs or overestimate the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership interests. In addition, we have in the past and may record impairment charges in the future related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited.Achieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions, including joint ventures and other strategic investments in which we have management and operational control, depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, facilities, technology, products, processes, operations (including supply and manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers and suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not derive any commercial value from associated technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these technologies, and we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain, and we may become subject to litigation. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sales or distribution channels, business or operational models, geographic regions, industry segments or applications served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of our strategic acquisitions.If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions or other strategic activities, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transactions.Many of our acquisitions and other strategic investments require approval by the United States and foreign government agencies. Certain agencies in the past have, and may in the future, deny the transaction or fail to approve in a timely manner, resulting in us not realizing the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction. Future acquisitions or other strategic investments may be more difficult, complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed. Further, if U.S./China relations remain strained, our ability to consummate any transaction that would require approval from the relevant regulatory agency(ies) in China may be severely impacted.RISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CRITICAL INFORMATION Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our information technology systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.Third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems, and many such attempts are increasingly more sophisticated. The perception that the COVID-19 pandemic has made companies’ information technology systems more vulnerable has increased the already significant volume of such attempts. These attempts, which might be related to industrial, corporate or other espionage, criminal hackers or state-sponsored intrusions, include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers and networks, including those in our manufacturing operations, and impersonating authorized users, among others. We may also be subject to ransom-style cyber-attacks, which could impact our information technology systems and cause widespread disruption to our business, including our manufacturing operations, and expose our confidential or propriety information. In addition, third parties that we may rely on to store and/or process our confidential information may also be subject to similar threats. Such threats could result in the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, as well as damage to or disruptions in our information technology systems. These threats are constantly evolving, increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. We seek to detect and investigate all security 29incidents and to prevent their recurrence, but attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems or other attacks may be successful, and in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. In addition, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, have in the past and may in the future misappropriate, use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information. This risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire our employees. See also the Risk Factor entitled “We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.” Similarly, we provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees and certain of our consultants, who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors. We also provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to certain of our joint venture partners, including those affiliated with state actors and including in foreign jurisdictions where ownership restrictions may require us to take a minority ownership interest in the joint venture. Such joint venture partners may wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors.The misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, cause us to lose business, damage our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings, cause us to incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our information technology systems, and our technology, intellectual property and proprietary and confidential information.Further, China has implemented, and other countries or regions may implement, cybersecurity laws that require our overall information technology security environment to meet certain standards and/or be certified. Such laws may be complex, ambiguous and subject to interpretation, which may create uncertainty regarding compliance. As a result, our efforts to comply with such laws may be expensive and may fail, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property and by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions.We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, international treaties and other methods, to protect our intellectual property, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and intellectual property is difficult and time consuming. The steps we have taken have not always prevented, and we cannot be certain the steps we will take in the future will prevent, the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our products, technologies or intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully or as readily as U.S. laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective. See also the Risk Factor entitled “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our information technology systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.”Some industry participants who have a vested interest in devaluing patents in general, or standard-essential patents in particular, have mounted attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established patent laws. In the United States, there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law changes and current and potential future litigation regarding patents, the outcomes of which could be detrimental to our licensing business. The laws in certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including certain countries in Asia, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any potential changes. In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of any standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in the future in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our products or technologies.We have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property and contracts, including collecting royalties for use of our patent portfolio due to, among others: refusal by certain licensees to report and pay all or a portion of the royalties they owe to us; policies or political actions of governments, including trade protection and national security policies; challenges to our licensing practices under competition laws; adoption of mandatory licensing provisions by foreign jurisdictions; failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce judgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and challenges before competition agencies to our licensing business and the pricing and integration of additional features and functionality into our chipset products. See also the Risk Factors entitled “Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our 30intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business” and “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or proceedings.” We have engaged in litigation and arbitration in the past and may need to further litigate or arbitrate in the future to enforce our contract and intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation or arbitration, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable (which may in turn result in other licensees either not complying with their existing license agreements or initiating litigation or arbitration), license terms (including but not limited to royalty rates for the use of our intellectual property) could be imposed that are less favorable to us than existing terms, and we could incur substantial costs. Any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Further, even a positive resolution to our enforcement efforts may take time to conclude, which may reduce our revenues and cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development, in the periods prior to conclusion. Additionally, although our license agreements provide us with the right to audit the books and records of licensees, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. Further, certain licensees may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their books and records. To the extent we do not aggressively enforce our rights under our license agreements, licensees may not comply with their existing license agreements, and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed companies to enter into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, other unlicensed companies may not enter into license agreements. Similarly, we provide access to certain of our intellectual property and proprietary and confidential business information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees, who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use such intellectual property and information or wrongfully disclose such intellectual property and information to third parties, including our competitors. See also the Risk Factor entitled “Efforts by some OEMs to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.”Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business.From time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright and other intellectual property claims against our products or products using our technologies or other technologies used in our industry. These claims have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such litigation given, among other factors, the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products were found to infringe another company’s intellectual property, we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our products, or to license such intellectual property or pay damages or other compensation to such other company (any of which could be costly). If we are unable to redesign our products, license such intellectual property used in our products or otherwise distribute our products (e.g., through a licensed supplier), we could be prohibited from making and selling our products. Similarly, our suppliers could be found to infringe another company’s intellectual property, and such suppliers could then be enjoined from providing products or services to us.In any potential dispute involving us and another company’s patents or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products sold by us, or by intellectual property provided by us to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees’ sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delays, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.We may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (or on the sale of our customers’ devices using such products) or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our chipset customers and their wireless operator 31customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees’ sales to wireless operators, causing corresponding declines in our chipset or licensing revenues.Certain legal matters, which may include certain claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property, are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”Our use of open source software may harm our business.Certain of our software and our suppliers’ software may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, and we have seen, and believe that we will continue to see, an increase in customers requesting that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of our products’ source code and may expose our related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of that software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Furthermore, in the course of product development, we may make contributions to third-party open source projects that could obligate our intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. For example, to encourage the growth of a software ecosystem that is interoperable with our products, we may need to contribute certain implementations under the open source licensing terms that govern such projects, which may adversely impact our associated intellectual property. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property upon which our licensing program depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Also, our use and our customers’ use of open source software may subject our products and our customers’ products to governmental and third-party scrutiny and delays in product certification, which could cause customers to view our products as less desirable than our competitors’ products. While we believe we have taken appropriate steps and employ adequate controls to protect our intellectual property, our contributions to and use of open source software presents risks that could have an adverse effect on these and on our business.RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees.Our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees, including by establishing local offices near our headquarters in San Diego, California. A number of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and are able to offer compensation in excess of what we are able to offer. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed. RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES Failures in our products, or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.Our products (including related software) are complex and may contain defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system. Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects or errors might only be detected when the products are in use. Development of products in new domains of technology, such as the transition to 5G, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects or errors. Risks associated with product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into consumer and other devices.The use of devices containing our products to interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Security vulnerabilities in our products could expose our customers or end users to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses, worms and other malicious software programs that could attack our products or those of our customers. While we continue to focus on this issue and take measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities continue to evolve, enabling more elaborate functionality and applications, and increasing the risk of security failures.Our products may be responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products and networks. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell to our customers, the devices into which our products are integrated and to the end users of such devices. 32Such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities could give rise to significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, repairing or replacing defective products, writing down defective inventory, or the indemnification clauses in our agreements, and could result in the loss of sales and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, a loss of design wins, a shifting of business to our competitors, and litigation or regulatory action against us, and could harm our reputation, our relationships with customers and partners and our ability to attract new customers, as well as the perceptions of our brand. Other potential adverse impacts of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities include shipment delays, write-offs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and losses on unfavorable purchase commitments. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in the products of our customers or licensees could cause a delay or decrease in demand for the products into which our products are integrated, and thus for our products.In addition, the occurrence of defects may give rise to product liability claims, particularly if defects in our products or the products into which they are integrated result in personal injury or death, and could result in significant costs, expenses and losses. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant, and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business, even if we are successful. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question, and even though we may have indemnity from our customers, and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate, or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results. The above is exacerbated by the fact that our products may be used, and perform critical functions, in various high-risk applications such as automobiles, including autonomous driver assistance programs; cameras and artificial intelligence, including home and enterprise security; home automation, including smoke and noxious gas detectors; medical condition monitoring; location and asset tracking and management, including wearables for child safety and elderly health; robotics, including public safety drones and autonomous municipality vehicles; and extended reality (XR) for treatment of phobias or PTSD, early detection of disorders or special needs, among others.Accordingly, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and the end users of our customers’ products. If any of these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.GENERAL RISK FACTORS We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns. We are also susceptible to declines in global, regional and local economic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to these dynamics, among others.The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, volatile, subject to downturns and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. Periods of downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, excess or obsolete inventory adjustments, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and erosion of average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to such cyclical downturns. Consequently, our revenues may decline, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted.A decline in global, regional or local economic conditions or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or licensees, could have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including a decrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our customers and/or the inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties; and/or negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers’ and licensees’ ability to purchase or pay for our products and intellectual property and network operators’ ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be adversely affected, potentially leading to a reduction, cancellation or delay of orders for our products.Our stock price and financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock and our financial results include those identified above and throughout this Risk Factors section; volatility of the stock market in general and technology and semiconductor companies in particular; announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers or licensees; and variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors, among others. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities, among other reasons. We are and may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s attention and our resources. Certain legal matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”33Our business may suffer due to the impact of, or our failure to comply with, the various existing, new or amended laws, regulations, policies or standards to which we are subject.Our business and products, and those of our customers and licensees, are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally as well as government policies and the specifications of international, national and regional communications standards bodies (collectively, Regulations). Compliance with, or changes in the interpretation of, existing Regulations, changes in the oversight of our activities by governments or standards bodies, or rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such Regulations, including, among others, Regulations affecting patent licensing practices; antitrust, competition and competitive business practices; the flow of funds out of certain countries (e.g., China); cybersecurity; import and export regulations such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce; protection of intellectual property; trade and trade protection including tariffs; foreign policy and national security; environmental protection, health and safety; supply chain, responsible sourcing, including the use of conflict minerals, and human rights; spectrum availability and license issuance; adoption of standards; taxation; privacy and data protection; labor, employment and human capital; corporate governance; public disclosure; or business conduct, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See also the Risk Factors entitled “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in government investigations or proceedings,” “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations or private legal proceedings challenging those practices, or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations,” “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions,” “There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model, environmental compliance and liability, issues related to climate change, exposure to natural disasters, timely supply of equipment and materials, and various manufacturing issues,” and “Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.”Regulations are complex and changing (which may create uncertainty regarding compliance), are subject to varying interpretations, and their application in practice may evolve over time. As a result, our efforts to comply with Regulations may fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. Failure to comply with any Regulation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. New Regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies or procedures and may divert management time and attention to compliance activities.There are risks associated with our debt.Our outstanding debt and any additional debt we incur may have negative consequences on our business, including, among others: requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, industries or the market. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to economic and political conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend payments and/or our stock repurchase program; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such refinancing or restructuring would increase. Further, if there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt in the future and the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly are subject to examination of our tax returns and reports by taxing authorities in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, most notably in countries where we earn a routine return and the tax authorities believe substantial value-add activities are performed. Although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. In such case, our income tax provision, results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made could be negatively affected.Tax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business. In response to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and to better align our profits with our activities, we implemented certain restructuring in fiscal 2018 and 2019. After our restructuring, most of our income is taxable in the United States with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as FDII (foreign-derived intangible income). Beginning in fiscal 2027, the effective tax rate for FDII increases from 13% to 16%. Further, if U.S. tax rates increase or the FDII deduction is eliminated or reduced, our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected. Also, if our customers move manufacturing operations to the United States, our FDII deduction will be reduced. 34We have tax incentives in Singapore that require we meet specified employment and other criteria. Although our profit in Singapore has declined as a result of our 2018 restructuring, failure to meet these incentive requirements through March 2022 could result in a retroactive Singapore tax increase for 2017 and 2018.Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to transfer pricing and continues to develop new proposals including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establishing a minimum tax on global income. These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows. Partially to address BEPS, we moved certain intellectual property from Singapore to the United States as part of our 2018 and 2019 restructuring. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2. PropertiesAt September 27, 2020, we occupied the following facilities (square footage in millions):United StatesOther CountriesTotalOwned facilities4.4 0.4 4.8 Leased facilities0.9 6.2 7.1 Total5.3 6.6 11.9 Our headquarters and certain research and development, manufacturing and network management hub operations are located in San Diego, California.

We expect to continue to invest in research and development in a variety of ways in an effort to extend the demand for our products and technologies and to utilize that research and development in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT), including continuing the development of new modem and multimedia technologies and other technologies (such as ADAS and XR), developing alternative technologies for certain specialized applications, participating in the formulation of new voice and data communication standards and technologies and assisting in deploying digital voice and data communications networks around the world. Our research and development team has a demonstrated track record of innovation in voice and data communication technologies and application processor technology, among others.We continue to invest significant resources towards advancements in OFDMA-based technologies and products (including LTE and 5G). We also engage in acquisitions and other transactions, such as joint ventures, to meet certain technology needs, to obtain development resources or open or expand opportunities for our technologies and to support the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products and services) for voice and data communications and new industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. We make investments to provide our integrated circuit customers with chipsets designed on leading-edge technology nodes that combine multiple technologies for use in consumer electronic devices (e.g., smartphones, tablets, laptops, voice and music devices, wearable devices, XR devices) and other products (e.g., access points and routers, data cards and infrastructure equipment). In addition to 3G, 4G and 5G technologies, our chipsets support other wireless and wired connectivity technologies, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, location positioning and Powerline communication. Our integrated chipsets often include multiple technologies, including advanced multimode modems, application processors and graphics engines, as well as the tools to connect these diverse technologies. We continue to support Android, Windows and other client software environments in our chipsets.We develop on our own, and with our partners, innovations that are integrated into our product portfolio to further expand the opportunity for wireless communications and enhance the value of our products and services. These innovations are expected to enable our customers to improve the performance or value of their existing services, offer these services more affordably and introduce revenue-generating broadband data services ahead of their competition.We have research and development centers in various locations throughout the world that support our global development activities and ongoing efforts to develop and/or advance 4G, 5G, RFFE and a broad range of other technologies. We continue to use our substantial engineering resources and expertise to develop new technologies, applications and services and make them available to licensees to help grow the communications industry and generate new or expanded licensing opportunities.Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) and Human CapitalFor decades, our innovations have helped transform industries, enhance people’s lives and address some of society’s biggest challenges. With the world becoming increasingly connected, we have a tremendous opportunity to shape a better future. We believe in the power of technology. As such, our corporate responsibility vision is to be a facilitator of innovation for a sustainable world, connected wirelessly.We have integrated corporate responsibility throughout our business, from our daily operations to our executive leadership and our Board of Directors (Board). The Governance Committee of our Board provides oversight on corporate 16responsibility matters, including ESG policies, programs and initiatives, and the HR and Compensation Committee of our Board provides oversight on our workforce diversity and inclusion programs and initiatives. Our Corporate Responsibility Leadership Committee, composed of executives and senior management, provides guidance on global corporate responsibility issues. Our Corporate Responsibility Governance Committee implements directives from the Corporate Responsibility Leadership Committee, measures progress on achieving our goals, and reports to management on accomplishments and challenges.ESGOur sustained investment in R&D has helped revolutionize the way people connect; our approach to innovation is strategic and purposeful. We understand that the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our world. We focus our efforts in four key areas where we believe we can have the biggest impact: •Purposeful Innovation. We invent breakthrough technologies by building on our legacy of technology leadership with 5G, which we believe will serve as the technological foundation for connected cars, industrial IoT, smart homes and cities, networking and mobility, among others. Our 5G technology advancements are helping transform industries, like telemedicine and remote education, and driving efficiencies with always-connected devices. We believe that 5G can also help manage and improve the sustainability trajectory of our planet in key areas such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, water use, reduction of pesticides and energy efficiency, while providing an inherently lower CO2 footprint than previous network deployments. Through our Qualcomm® Wireless Reach™ program (Wireless Reach), we work to broaden our impact by bringing advanced wireless technologies to underserved communities around the world. Further, through the Qualcomm Small Business Accelerator Program, we have provided technology and support to U.S.-based small businesses in various industries to help them transition to a mobile-first remote work environment. •Our People. We strive to make Qualcomm an inspiring and inclusive workplace to advance the development of leading-edge technologies. Our success is only possible with the hard work and dedication of our employees. We celebrate diversity among our workforce and recognize that our varied backgrounds, experiences and ideas are critical to innovation. We seek to foster inclusive teams and educate and train employees and leaders on the importance of driving diversity. We also engage our global workforce through giving and outreach efforts to support and enrich the communities where we live and work. •STEM Education. Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is the foundation for everything we do. It supports the brainpower behind the breakthrough technologies and inventions we bring to life. As technology leaders and a company of inventors, we are committed to providing tomorrow’s workforce with the skills and knowledge to solve global challenges. Our initiatives are designed to promote and improve STEM education and to expand opportunities for underrepresented students.•Responsible Business. We strive to integrate responsible and sustainable practices throughout our organization. We continually look for ways to conserve water, minimize energy consumption, lower emissions and reduce waste. We prioritize transparency in our actions and reporting, including reporting on our ESG risks and opportunities using the TCFD (Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures), SASB (Sustainability Accounting Standards Board) and GRI (Global Reporting Initiative) frameworks in our Qualcomm Corporate Responsibility Report (located on our website). Because privacy and cybersecurity are critical for success in the wireless industry, we seek to promote data protection across the mobile ecosystem. Further, we are committed to respecting all internationally recognized human rights and avoiding complicity in any human rights abuse, upholding adherence to our Supplier Code of Conduct in our extended supply chain, being a global leader in ethical business conduct and engaging in discussions to advocate for policies that promote innovation as well as protect and foster new ideas in mobile communications. 2025 Goals. In addition to the human capital goals discussed below, our 2025 Goals related to corporate responsibility include, among others:•Reduce our absolute Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions by 30% from global operations, compared to a 2014 baseline.•Reduce power consumption by 10% every year in our flagship Snapdragon Mobile Platform products (given equivalent features).•Ensure 100% of our primary semiconductor manufacturing suppliers are audited every 2-years for conformance to our Supplier Code of Conduct.Net-Zero Global GHG Emissions Commitment. In addition to our 2025 Goals, in November 2021, we announced plans to: (1) reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 global GHG emissions by 50% by 2030 from 2020 base year; (2) reduce absolute Scope 3 global GHG emissions by 25% by 2030 from 2020 base year; and (3) reach net-zero global GHG emissions for Scopes 1, 2 and 3 by 2040.The foregoing discussion includes information regarding ESG matters that we believe may be of interest to our stockholders generally. We recognize that certain other stakeholders (such as customers, employees and non-governmental organizations), as well as certain of our stockholders, may be interested in more detailed information on these topics. We encourage you to review our most recent Qualcomm Corporate Responsibility Report (located on our website) for more 17detailed information regarding our Corporate Responsibility and ESG governance, goals, priorities, accomplishments and initiatives; a 5G and sustainability report, Environmental Sustainability and a Greener Economy: The Transformative Role of 5G (also located on our website) for additional information regarding our views on climate change, environmental sustainability and the role of 5G in enabling a more sustainable future; as well as the Corporate Governance section of our most recent Proxy Statement, and our Corporate Governance Principles and Practices (located on our website), for additional information regarding governance matters, including Board and Committee leadership, oversight, roles and responsibilities, and Director independence, tenure, refreshment and diversity. Nothing on our website, including the aforementioned reports, documents or sections thereof, shall be deemed incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.Human Capital In order to continue to produce the innovative, breakthrough technologies for which we are known, it is crucial that we continue to attract and retain top talent. To facilitate talent attraction and retention, we strive to make Qualcomm a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers, supported by strong compensation, benefits and health and wellness programs and by programs that build connections between our employees and their communities.At September 26, 2021, we had approximately 45,000 full-time, part-time and temporary employees, the overwhelming majority of which were full-time employees. During fiscal 2021, the number of employees increased by approximately 4,000, primarily due to increases in engineering resources. Our employees are represented by more than 100 self-identified nationalities working in over 150 locations in 33 different countries around the world. Collectively, we speak more than 90 different languages. Our global workforce is highly educated, with the substantial majority of our employees working in engineering or technical roles (many of whom help develop foundational technologies for both our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business). During fiscal 2021, our voluntary turnover rate was less than 7%, below the technology industry benchmark, which is comprised of certain of our key competitors (Aon, 2021 Salary Increase and Turnover Study - Second Edition, September 2021).Diversity and Inclusion. We believe that a diverse workforce is critical to our success, and we continue to focus on the hiring, retention and advancement of women and underrepresented populations. Our recent efforts have been focused in three areas: inspiring innovation through an inclusive and diverse culture; expanding our efforts to recruit and hire world-class diverse talent; and identifying strategic partners to accelerate our inclusion and diversity programs. We have employee networks that enhance our inclusive and diverse culture, including global network groups focused on supporting women, LGBTQ+ employees and employees with disabilities, in addition to U.S.-based employee networks that focus on Black and African American employees, Hispanic and Latinx employees and U.S. military members and veterans.We continue to recruit technical talent in diverse communities, including by engaging as a high-level sponsor of professional conferences, such as the Grace Hopper Celebration, the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers National Convention and the National Society of Black Engineers National Convention. We also continue to recruit from a variety of colleges including Hispanic-Serving Institutions, Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Women’s Colleges. Our continued engagement with organizations that work with diverse communities has been vital to our efforts to increase women and minority representation in our workforce. For example, we partner with AnitaB.org to benchmark our progress and identify promising practices for recruiting, retaining and advancing women technologists and support its research initiatives related to attracting and retaining women and underrepresented minority students in computing majors. We, alongside other top technology companies, helped form the Reboot Representation Tech Coalition, which aims to double the number of Black, Latinx and Native American women receiving computing degrees by 2025. In collaboration with the National Foundation for Autism Research, we started an internship program to welcome those with autism into our Company. Through our collaboration with Disability:IN’s Inclusion Works program, we have increased our ability to address the needs of individuals with disabilities. We publish our most recent Consolidated EEO-1 reports on our website to provide additional transparency into our efforts to increase underrepresented populations in our workforce. From a governance perspective, the HR and Compensation Committee of our Board, through its charter, provides oversight of our policies, programs and initiatives focusing on workforce diversity and inclusion.Health, Safety and Wellness. The success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people. Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees. We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations. This included having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work. We introduced our Live+Well, Work+Well program, designed to 18help cultivate a productive work environment, while also focusing on our employees’ wellbeing. We have commenced a phased approach to returning our employees onsite, which included modifications to certain of our existing office locations as we adapt to a hybrid work environment that provides flexibility, while maintaining our strong culture of innovation, collaboration, openness and camaraderie, in addition to a safe working environment for our employees. We continue to monitor the state of the pandemic and gather additional feedback during the reopening of our offices to ensure the continued health, safety and wellness of our employees working onsite.Compensation and Benefits. We provide robust compensation and benefits programs to help meet the needs of our employees. In addition to salaries, these programs (which vary by country/region) include annual bonuses, stock awards, an employee stock purchase plan, a 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, family care resources, flexible work schedules, adoption and surrogacy assistance, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance and on-site services, such as health centers and fitness centers, among many others. In addition to our broad-based equity award programs, we have used targeted equity-based grants with vesting conditions to facilitate retention of personnel, particularly those with critical engineering skills and experience.Talent Development. We invest significant resources to develop the talent needed to remain a world-leading wireless innovator. We deliver numerous training opportunities, provide rotational assignment opportunities, have expanded our focus on continuous learning and development, and implemented “industry-leading” methodologies to manage performance, provide feedback and develop talent.Our talent development programs provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations. We provide a series of employee workshops around the globe that support professional growth and development. Additionally, our manager and employee forum programs provide an ongoing opportunity for employees to practice and apply learning around conversations aligned with our annual review process. We also have an employee development website that provides quick access to learning resources that are personalized to the individual’s development needs.Building Connections - With Each Other and our Communities. We believe that building connections between our employees, their families and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. Through our engagement programs, our employees can pursue their interests and hobbies, connect to volunteering and giving opportunities and enjoy unique recreational experiences with family members. Leveraging our partnerships with various local arts and culture organizations, we have created numerous unique experiences for employees and their families around the world. Since our employees are passionate about many causes, our corporate giving and volunteering programs support and encourage employees by engaging with those causes. In our offices around the world, our employee-led Giving Committees select local organizations to support, often in the form of grants that are primarily funded by the Qualcomm Foundation (which was established in 2011 to support charitable giving and volunteerism). We also frequently collaborate with these organizations on volunteer activities for our employees. Additionally, during fiscal 2021, thousands of our employees around the world utilized our charitable match program, benefiting more than 1,600 charitable organizations.2025 Goals. We set the following 2025 Goals related to human capital, with a focus on diversity and inclusion:•Increase women in leadership by 15% (defined as individuals at the principal and above level in technical roles, and director and above in non-technical roles). •Increase underrepresented minorities (URM) in leadership by 15% (for technical positions, “URM” includes Black, Latinx, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, and American Indian or Native American; for non-technical positions, URM also includes Asian). •Increase overall URM representation by 20%.Human Capital Advancements Added to our Executive Compensation. As previously disclosed in our 2021 Proxy Statement, and in response to stockholder feedback, our HR and Compensation Committee allocated 10% of our executives’ fiscal 2021 bonus to be based upon human capital advancements. The HR and Compensation Committee then adopted a framework for human capital advancements to include advancement of our 2025 diversity and inclusion goals, workforce stability and responsiveness to COVID-19. The foregoing discussion includes information regarding Human Capital matters that we believe may be of interest to stockholders generally. We recognize that certain other stakeholders (such as customers, employees and non-governmental organizations), as well as certain of our stockholders, may be interested in more detailed information on these topics. We encourage you to review the “Our People” section of our most recent Qualcomm Corporate Responsibility Report (located on our website) for more detailed information regarding our Human Capital goals, programs and initiatives.

Risk FactorsYou should consider each of the following factors in evaluating our business and our prospects. However, the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and require significant management time and attention. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. You should also consider the other information set forth in this Annual Report in evaluating our business and our prospects, including but not limited to our financial statements and the related notes, and “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” References to “and,” “or” and “and/or” should be read to include the others, as appropriate.RISKS RELATED TO THE CORONAVIRUS (COVID-19) PANDEMICThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic had an adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and may continue to impact us in the future.The rapid, global spread of COVID-19 and the fear it created resulted in significant economic uncertainty, significant declines in business and consumer confidence and global demand in the wireless industry (among others) and a global economic slowdown, which resulted in a global recession. Specifically, throughout most of calendar 2020 and into early calendar 2021, the decline in demand for smartphones and other consumer devices sold by our customers or licensees resulted in decreased demand for our integrated circuit products (which are incorporated into such devices) and a decrease in the royalties we earned on the licensing of our intellectual property (which is dependent upon the number of such devices sold that utilize our intellectual property). The COVID-19 pandemic could impact our business, results of operations and financial condition in the future through delayed, reduced or cancelled customer orders; disruptions or delays in our supply chain; the inability of our customers or licensees to purchase or pay for our products or technologies; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; or failures by other counterparties. Additionally, federal, state or foreign governments may in the future increase corporate tax rates, increase employer payroll tax obligations and/or otherwise change tax laws to pay for stimulus and other actions that have been and may in the future be taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.The COVID-19 pandemic also caused us to modify our workforce practices, such as having the vast majority of our employees working from home. We could be negatively affected in the future if, among others, a significant number of our employees, or employees who perform critical functions, become ill and/or are quarantined as the result of exposure to COVID-19, or if government policies restrict the ability of those employees to perform their critical functions. Further, our efforts to reopen our offices safely may not be successful, could expose our employees, customers, licensees and partners to health risks and us to associated liability, and could result in disruptions among our employees. See also the Risk Factor titled “We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees, and our attempts to fully reopen our offices and operate under a hybrid working environment may not be successful.” The degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our future business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are uncertain, including but not limited to the duration, spread and severity of the pandemic; the availability, adoption and efficacy of vaccines; the emergence, spread and severity of new variants of COVID-19, and the protection afforded by vaccines against such variants; government responses and other actions to mitigate the spread of and to treat COVID-19; and when and to what extent normal business, economic and social activity and conditions resume. We are similarly unable to predict the extent to which the pandemic impacts our customers, licensees, suppliers and other partners and their financial conditions, but adverse effects on these parties could also adversely affect us. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic may make it harder for management to estimate the future performance of our business. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations and financial condition, it may also have the effect of exacerbating the other risks discussed in this “Risk Factors” section.RISKS RELATED TO OUR OPERATING BUSINESSESWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices, and we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future. Our industry is experiencing and may continue to experience concentration of device share among a few companies, particularly at the premium tier, contributing to this trend. Certain Chinese OEMs continue to grow their device share in China and are increasing their device share in regions outside of China, and we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of these OEMs as well. See also “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 1. Significant Accounting Policies - Concentrations.” In addition, a number of our largest integrated circuit customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products, or may choose our competitors’ integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some (or all) of their devices, rather than our products, which could 21significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).”Further, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers, limit, prevent or discourage those customers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so, any of which could also significantly reduce the revenues we derive from these customers. See also the Risk Factor titled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.”In addition, we spend a significant amount of engineering and development time, funds and resources in understanding our key customers’ feedback and/or specifications and attempt to incorporate such input into our product launches and technologies. These efforts may not require or result in purchase commitments from such customers or we may have lower purchases from such customers than expected, and consequently, we may not achieve the anticipated revenues from these efforts, or these efforts may result in non-recoverable costs.The loss of any one of our significant customers, a reduction in the purchases of our products by such customers or the cancellation of significant purchases by any of these customers, whether due to the use of their own integrated circuit products or our competitors’ integrated circuit products, government restrictions, the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, would reduce our revenues and could harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected results of operations, and a delay of significant purchases, even if only temporary, would reduce our revenues in the period of the delay. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development. Further, the concentration of device share among a few companies, and the corresponding purchasing power of these companies, may result in lower prices for our products which, if not accompanied by a sufficient increase in the volume of purchases of our products, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and margins. In addition, the timing and size of purchases by our significant customers may be impacted by the timing of such customers’ new or next generation product introductions, over which we have no control, and the timing and success of such introductions may cause our revenues and results of operations to fluctuate. Apple purchases our MDM (or thin modem) products, which do not include our integrated application processor technology, and which have lower revenue and margin contributions than our combined modem and application processor products. Consequently, to the extent Apple takes device share from our customers who purchase our integrated modem and application processor products, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted.Our industry has also experienced slowing growth in the premium-tier device segment due to, among other factors, a maturing premium-tier smartphone industry in which demand is increasingly driven by new product launches and innovation cycles.A reduction in sales of premium-tier devices, a reduction in sales of our premium-tier integrated circuit products (which have a higher revenue and margin contribution than our lower-tier integrated circuit products), or a shift in share away from OEMs that utilize our premium-tier products, would reduce our revenues and margins and may harm our ability to achieve or sustain expected financial results. Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development. Further, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration. Although we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees’ products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues. Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).Certain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some (or all) of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us). 22Apple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors’ products in several of its prior device launches. In April 2019, we entered into a multi-year chipset supply agreement with Apple and began shipping modems under this agreement in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel’s modem assets and is developing its own modem products using these assets. Accordingly, Apple is expected to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some (or all) of its future devices. Similarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. In addition, supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.If some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some (or all) of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled “We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.”A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.We derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in their devices and sell those devices into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.Due to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (including its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our Chinese integrated circuit customers have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices, or use our competitors’ integrated circuit products in their devices, rather than our products. Political actions, including trade protection and national security policies of the U.S. and Chinese governments, such as tariffs, bans or placing companies on restricted entity lists, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers, limit, prevent or discourage certain of our Chinese customers or suppliers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so. Given our revenue concentration in China, if, due to actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies: we were further limited in, or prohibited from, selling our integrated circuit products to Chinese OEMs; if our non-Chinese OEM customers were limited in, or prohibited from, selling devices into China that incorporate our integrated circuit products; if Chinese OEMs develop and use their own integrated circuit products or use our competitors’ integrated circuit products in some (or all) of their devices rather than our integrated circuit products; if Chinese tariffs on our integrated circuit products or on devices which incorporate our integrated circuit products made purchasing such products or devices more expensive to Chinese OEMs or Chinese consumers; or if our Chinese licensees delay or cease making payments of license fees they owe us, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. Similarly, if, due to U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, we were limited in or prohibited from obtaining critical integrated circuit products from our suppliers in China, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially harmed. Finally, government policies in China that regulate the amount and timing of funds that may flow out of the country have impacted and may continue to impact the timing of our receipt of, and/or ability to receive, payments from our customers and licensees in China, which may negatively impact our cash flows.RISKS RELATED TO NEW INITIATIVES Our growth depends in part on our ability to extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and related technologies and products, as well as in our existing technologies and products, and new technologies, may not generate operating income or contribute to future results of operations that meet our expectations.While we continue to invest significant resources toward advancements primarily in support of 4G- and 5G-based technologies, we also invest in new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, by utilizing our existing technical and business expertise and through acquisitions or other strategic transactions.23In particular, our future growth depends in part on new and expanded product areas, such as RFFE, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT; our ability to develop leading and cost-effective technologies and products for these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; and third parties incorporating our technologies and products into devices used in these product areas, industries and applications. Accordingly, we intend to continue to make substantial investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and in developing new products and technologies for these product areas, industries and applications. Our growth also depends significantly on our ability to develop and patent 5G technologies, and to develop and commercialize products using 5G technologies.However, our research, development and other investments in these new and expanded product areas, industries and applications, and corresponding technologies and products, as well as in our existing, technologies and products and new technologies, such as 5G, use of licensed, shared and unlicensed spectrum and convergence of cellular and Wi-Fi, may not succeed because, among other reasons: we may not be issued patents on the technologies we develop; the technologies we develop may not be incorporated into relevant standards; new and expanded product areas, industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, and consumer demand therein, may not develop or grow as anticipated; we may be unable to attract or retain employees with the necessary skills in such new and expanded product areas, industries and applications; our strategies or the strategies of our customers, licensees or partners may not be successful; alternate technologies may be better or may reduce the advantages we anticipate from our investments; competitors’ technologies or products may be more cost effective, have more capabilities or fewer limitations or be brought to market faster than our new technologies or products; we may not be able to develop, or our competitors may have more established and/or stronger, customer, vendor, distributor or other channel relationships; and competitors may have longer operating histories in industries and applications that are new to us. We may also underestimate the costs of or overestimate the future revenues or margins that could result from these investments, and these investments may not, or may take many years to, generate material returns. Further, the automotive industry is subject to long design-in time frames, long product life cycles and a high degree of regulatory and safety requirements, necessitating suppliers to the industry to comply with stringent qualification processes, very low defect rates and high reliability standards, all of which results in significant barriers to entry and increased costs.In addition, in order to successfully extend our technologies and products into new and expanded product areas, and industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we may need to transition to new business models and transform aspects of our organization, and we may not be successful in doing so.If our new technologies and products are not successful, or are not successful in the time frames we anticipate, we may incur significant costs and asset impairments, our business and revenues may not grow or grow as anticipated, our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted, our stock price may decline and our reputation may be harmed.We may engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions or make investments, or be unable to consummate planned strategic acquisitions, which could adversely affect our results of operations or fail to enhance stockholder value.We engage in acquisitions and other strategic transactions, including joint ventures, and make investments, which we believe are important to the future of our business, with the goal of maximizing stockholder value. From time to time, we acquire businesses and other assets, including patents, technology and other intangible assets, enter into joint ventures or other strategic transactions and purchase minority equity interests in or make loans to companies, including those that may be private and early-stage. Our strategic activities are generally focused on opening or expanding opportunities for our products and technologies and supporting the design and introduction of new products (or enhancing existing products) for mobile handsets, and for new industries and applications beyond mobile handsets. Many of our strategic activities entail a high degree of risk and require the use of significant amounts of capital, and investments may not become liquid for several years after the date of the investment, if at all. Our strategic activities may not generate financial returns or result in increased adoption or continued use of our technologies or products. We may underestimate the costs or overestimate the benefits, including product, revenue, cost and other synergies and growth opportunities that we expect to realize, and we may not achieve those benefits. In some cases, we may be required to consolidate or record our share of the earnings or losses of companies in which we have acquired ownership interests. In addition, we have in the past recorded, and may in the future record, impairment or other charges related to our strategic activities. Any losses or impairment charges that we incur related to strategic activities will have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition, and we may continue to incur new or additional losses related to strategic assets or investments that we have not fully impaired or exited.Achieving the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions depends in part upon our ability to integrate the businesses in an efficient and effective manner and achieve anticipated synergies, and we may not be successful in these efforts. Such integration is complex and time consuming and involves significant challenges, including, among others: retaining key employees; successfully integrating new employees, facilities, technology, products, processes, operations (including supply and manufacturing operations), sales and distribution channels, business models and business systems; retaining customers and suppliers of the businesses; consolidating research and development operations; minimizing the diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business matters; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and managing the increased scale, complexity and globalization of our business, operations and employee base. We may not derive any commercial value from associated technologies or products or from future technologies or products based on these technologies, and we may be subject to liabilities that are not covered by indemnification protection that we may obtain, and we may become subject to litigation. Additionally, we may not be successful in entering or expanding into new sales or 24distribution channels, business or operational models, geographic regions, industries and applications served by or adjacent to the associated businesses or in addressing potential new opportunities that may arise out of our strategic acquisitions.If we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of business acquisitions or other strategic activities, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected, and we may not enhance stockholder value by engaging in these transactions.Many of our acquisitions and other strategic investments require approval by the United States and/or foreign government agencies. Certain agencies in the past have, and may in the future, deny the transaction or fail to approve in a timely manner, resulting in us not realizing the anticipated benefits of the proposed transaction. Future acquisitions or other strategic investments may be more difficult, complex or expensive to the extent that our reputation for our ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed. Further, if U.S./China relations remain strained, our ability to consummate any transaction that would require approval from the relevant regulatory agency(ies) in China may be severely impacted.RISKS RELATED TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURING We depend on a limited number of third-party suppliers for the procurement, manufacture, assembly and testing of our products manufactured in a fabless production model. If we fail to execute supply strategies that provide supply assurance, technology leadership and reasonable margins, our business and results of operations may be harmed. We are also subject to order and shipment uncertainties that could negatively impact our results of operations.We primarily utilize a fabless production model, which means that we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our integrated circuits are made. Other than the facilities we own that manufacture certain of our RFFE modules and RF (radio frequency) filter products, we rely on third-party suppliers to perform the manufacturing and assembly, and most of the testing, of our integrated circuits. Our suppliers are also responsible for the procurement of most of the raw materials used in the production of our integrated circuits. There are a limited number of such third-party suppliers, and even fewer who are capable of manufacturing at the leading process technology nodes or who are willing to operate at older process technology nodes. The semiconductor manufacturing foundries that supply our products are primarily located in Asia, as are our primary warehouses where we store finished goods for fulfillment of customer orders. The following issues related to our third-party suppliers could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and negatively impact our revenues, business operations, profitability and cash flows:•a reduction, interruption, delay or limitation in our product supply sources;•a failure by our suppliers to procure raw materials or allocate adequate raw materials for our products;•an inability to procure or utilize raw materials, components or products from our suppliers due to government prohibitions or restrictions on transactions with certain countries and/or companies, and alternative suppliers, raw material sources or raw materials are not available or not available in acceptable time frames or upon acceptable terms;•a failure by our suppliers to allocate adequate manufacturing, assembly or test capacity for our products;•our suppliers’ inability to react to shifts in product demand or an increase in raw material or component prices;•our suppliers’ inability to develop or maintain, or a delay in developing or building out, manufacturing capacity for leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies;•the loss of a supplier or the inability of a supplier to meet performance, quality or yield specifications or delivery schedules; •additional expense or production delays as a result of qualifying a new supplier and commencing volume production or testing in the event of a loss of, or a decision to add or change, a supplier;•natural disasters, the effects of climate change or geopolitical conflicts impacting our suppliers; •health crises, including epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and government and business responses thereto, which impact our suppliers, including as a result of quarantines or closures; •cyber-attacks on our suppliers’ information technology (IT) systems, including those related to their manufacturing foundries or assembly, test or other facilities; and •trade or national security protection policies, particularly U.S. or Chinese government policies, that limit or prevent us from transacting business with suppliers of critical integrated circuit products, or that limit or prevent such suppliers from transacting business with us or from procuring materials, machinery or technology necessary to manufacture goods for us.While we have established alternate suppliers for certain technologies, there are a limited number of such suppliers, and even fewer who are capable of operating at the leading process technology nodes or who are willing to operate at older process technology nodes. We rely on sole- or limited-source suppliers for certain products, which may exacerbate the risks identified above, and subject us to other significant risks, including poor product performance and reduced control over delivery schedules, manufacturing capability and yields, quality assurance, quantity and costs. To the extent we have established or in the future establish alternate suppliers, these suppliers may require significant amounts of time and levels of 25support to bring such technologies to production, both of which may increase for complex or leading process technologies. As a result, we may invest a significant amount of effort and resources and incur higher costs to support and maintain such alternate suppliers. Further, the elimination or limitation of a foundry supplier’s ability to manufacture components or products for us due to trade or national security protection policies could increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and limit or prevent us from procuring critical components or products from those suppliers. Future consolidation of foundry suppliers could also increase our vulnerability to sole- or limited-source arrangements and reduce our suppliers’ willingness to negotiate pricing, which could negatively impact our ability to achieve cost reductions, increase our manufacturing costs and limit the amount of capacity available to us. Our arrangements with our suppliers may obligate us to incur costs to manufacture, assemble and test our products that do not decrease at the same rate as decreases in pricing to our customers. Our ability, and that of our suppliers, to develop or maintain leading process technologies, including transitions to smaller geometry process technologies (which adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability), and to effectively compete with the manufacturing processes and performance of our competitors, could impact our ability to introduce new products and meet customer demand, could increase our costs (possibly decreasing our margins) and could subject us to the risk of excess inventories. Any of the above could negatively impact our business, results of operations and cash flows.Although we have long-term contracts with our suppliers, some of these contracts do not provide for long-term capacity commitments. To the extent we do not have firm commitments from our suppliers over a specific time period or for any specific quantity, our suppliers may allocate, and in the past have allocated, capacity to the manufacture, assembly and testing of products for their other customers (including our competitors) while reducing or limiting capacity to manufacture, assemble or test our products, and such capacity may be limited based on our suppliers’ ability and willingness to invest in the capital required to manufacture in the leading process technologies. Our suppliers or potential alternate suppliers may also manufacture their own integrated circuits that compete with our products. Such suppliers have in the past and could again elect to allocate raw materials and manufacturing capacity to their own products and reduce or limit the production of our products. Accordingly, capacity for our products may not be available when we need it. To the extent we do obtain long-term capacity commitments, we may incur additional costs related to those commitments or make non-refundable payments for capacity commitments that are not used. In addition, we may not receive reasonable pricing, manufacturing or delivery terms from our suppliers, and our ability to obtain favorable terms may be diminished during times of high demand and/or limited manufacturing capacity for integrated circuit products. We cannot guarantee that the actions of our suppliers will not cause disruptions in our operations that could harm our ability to meet our delivery obligations to our customers or increase our cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to obtain adequate supply to meet our delivery obligations, we may be obligated to make payments to our customers for such shortfalls. Currently, the global semiconductor industry is experiencing demand for integrated circuits that exceeds the industry’s capacity to meet that demand. Our ability to meet increased demand for our products has been and may continue to be limited due to the inability to obtain the additional manufacturing, assembly and test capacity necessary to fully meet such demand. If we are unable to fully meet customer demand, this could result in lost sales opportunities, reduced revenue growth and harm to our customer relationships. These issues may be exacerbated if customers overstate their expected demand requirements in order to procure additional supply, which could negatively impact our ability to forecast and to allocate supply appropriately among our customers. These issues may also be exacerbated with respect to our platform solutions, which already entail a great deal of complexity due to differing lead-times, technologies and suppliers for each integrated circuit product included in such solutions.Additionally, we place orders with our suppliers using our and our customers’ forecasts of demand for our products, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates. As we move to smaller geometry process technologies, the manufacturing lead-time increases. As a result, the orders we place with our suppliers are generally only partially covered by commitments from our customers. If we, or our customers, overestimate demand, or if demand is impacted by factors outside of our or our customers’ control, and such demand is not covered by a binding commitment from our customers, we may experience increased excess or obsolete inventory, which would negatively impact our results of operations.See also the Risk Factor below titled “There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues” as similar risks, as well as additional risks, may be applicable to our third-party suppliers’ manufacturing facilities, which could result in disruptions to our business or additional costs to us, and negatively impact our results of operations.There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues.We own and operate various facilities that manufacture certain of our RFFE modules and RF filter products. Manufacturing facilities are characterized by a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model. We may be faced with a decline in the utilization rates of our manufacturing facilities due to decreases in demand for our products, including in less favorable industry environments, or due to our failure to win and/or retain designs with OEMs. During such periods, our 26manufacturing facilities could operate at lower capacity levels, while the fixed costs associated with such facilities would continue to be incurred, resulting in lower gross profit.We are subject to many complex environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and rules in each jurisdiction in which we operate our R&D and manufacturing facilities. The regulatory landscape in these areas continues to evolve, and we anticipate additional laws, regulations and rules in the future. In particular, new, or changes in, environmental and climate change laws, regulations or rules, including relating to GHG emissions, could lead to new or additional investments in production processes and could increase environmental compliance expenditures. In addition, certain environmental laws impose strict, and in certain circumstances joint and several, liability on current or previous owners or operators of real property, or parties who arranged for hazardous substances to be sent to disposal or treatment facilities, for the cost of investigation, removal or remediation of hazardous substances. As a result, we may incur clean-up costs in connection with any such removal or remediation efforts, as well as other third-party claims in connection with contaminated sites. In addition, we could be held liable for consequences arising out of human exposure to hazardous substances or other environmental damage. If we, or companies or facilities we acquire or have acquired, in the past failed or in the future fail to comply with any such laws and regulations, then we could incur regulatory penalties, fines, and legal liabilities; suspension of production; significant compliance requirements; alteration of our manufacturing, assembly or test processes; restriction on our ability to modify or expand our facilities; damage to our reputation; and restrictions on our operations or sales. We are also required to obtain and maintain environmental permits from governmental authorities for certain of our operations. We cannot make assurances that we will at all times be in compliance with such laws, regulations, rules and permits. See also the risk factor titled “Our business may suffer due to the impact of, or our failure to comply with, the various existing, new or amended laws, regulations, policies or standards to which we are subject.”Climate change concerns and the potential resulting environmental impact may result in new environmental, health and safety laws and regulations that may affect us, our suppliers and our customers. Such laws or regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, including costs associated with changes to manufacturing processes or the procurement of raw materials used in manufacturing processes, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, climate change could cause certain natural disasters, such as drought, wildfires, storms, flooding or rising sea levels, to occur more frequently or with greater intensity, which could pose physical risks to our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, could disrupt the availability of water necessary for the operation of our manufacturing facilities or our suppliers’ facilities, and could increase or decrease temperatures resulting in increased operating costs and/or business disruption.We have manufacturing facilities in Asia and Europe. If tsunamis, flooding, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, drought or other natural disasters, effects of climate change or geopolitical conflicts, were to damage, destroy or disrupt our manufacturing facilities, it could disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments of inventory and result in costly repairs, replacements or other costs. In addition, natural disasters, effects of climate change or geopolitical conflicts may result in disruptions in transportation, distribution channels and supply chains, and significant increases in the prices of raw materials. Further, health crises, including epidemics or pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and government and business responses thereto, could affect our manufacturing facilities, including by resulting in quarantines and/or closures, which would result in disruptions to and potential closures of our manufacturing operations. Our manufacturing operations could also be disrupted by cyber-attacks on our IT systems, as described in the Risk Factor below titled “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.”Our manufacturing operations depend on securing raw materials and other supplies in adequate quality and quantity in a timely manner from multiple suppliers, and in some cases, we rely on a limited number of suppliers, including in some cases sole suppliers, particularly in Asia. There may be cases where supplies of raw materials and other products are interrupted by disaster, accident or some other event at a supplier; supply is suspended due to quality or other issues; there is a shortage of supply due to a rapid increase in demand; and/or we or our suppliers are prohibited from utilizing certain raw materials, or products or components that incorporate such raw materials, due to government restrictions related to the countries from which such raw materials originate, and acceptable alternative suppliers, raw materials or raw materials sources are not available or not available in acceptable time frames or upon acceptable terms, among others, which could impact production and prevent us from supplying our products to our customers. If the supply-demand balance is disrupted, it may considerably increase costs of manufacturing due to increased prices we pay for raw materials. From time to time, suppliers may extend lead times, limit amounts supplied to us or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors. Additionally, supply and costs of raw materials may be negatively impacted by trade and/or national security protection policies, such as tariffs, or actions by governments that limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain countries or companies or that limit or prevent certain companies from transacting business with us, or trade tensions, particularly with countries in Asia. Further, it may be difficult or impossible to substitute one piece of equipment for another or replace one type of material with another. A failure by our suppliers to deliver our requirements could result in disruptions to our manufacturing operations.Our manufacturing processes are highly complex, require advanced and costly equipment and must be continuously modified to improve yields and performance. Difficulties in the production process can reduce yields or interrupt production, and as a result, we may not be able to deliver our products or do so in a timely, cost-effective or competitive manner. Further, to remain competitive and meet customer demand, we may be required to improve our facilities and process technologies and 27carry out extensive research and development, each of which may require investment of significant amounts of capital and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Finally, we typically begin manufacturing our products using our or our customers’ forecasts of demand for our products, which are based on a number of assumptions and estimates and may not be covered by long-term purchase commitments. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales, which sales ultimately may not materialize or may be lower than expected. If we or our customers overestimate demand, or if demand is impacted by factors outside of our or our customers’ control such as the COVID-19 pandemic or trade or national security protection policies, that is not under a binding commitment from our customers, we may experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and/or increased excess or obsolete inventory, which would negatively impact our results of operationsRISKS RELATED TO CYBERSECURITY OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF OUR CRITICAL INFORMATION Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.Third parties regularly attempt to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems, and many such attacks are increasingly more sophisticated. The perception that the COVID-19 pandemic has made companies’ IT systems more vulnerable has increased the already significant volume of such attacks. These attacks, which might be related to industrial, corporate or other espionage, criminal hackers or state-sponsored intrusions, include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers and networks, including those in our manufacturing operations, and impersonating authorized users, among others. We may also be subject to ransom-style cyber-attacks, which could impact our IT systems and cause widespread disruption to our business, including our manufacturing operations, and expose our confidential or propriety information. Third parties that store and/or process our confidential information, or that provide products, software or services used in our IT infrastructure (including applications), may be subject to similar attacks, which could also result in malware being introduced into our IT infrastructure, e.g., through the third parties’ software updates. Such attacks could result in the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, as well as damage to or disruptions in our IT systems. We believe that we have a robust cybersecurity program that is aligned to international cybersecurity frameworks, and that we leverage industry best practices across people, processes and technologies in an attempt to mitigate cybersecurity threats. However, we may not be able to anticipate, detect, repel or implement effective preventative measures against all cybersecurity threats, particularly because the techniques used are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. Attempts to gain unauthorized access to our IT systems or other attacks have in the past, in certain instances and to certain degrees, been successful (but have not caused significant harm), and may in the future be successful, and in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. In addition, employees and former employees, in particular former employees who become employees of our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, have in the past and may in the future misappropriate, use, publish or provide to our competitors, customers, licensees or other third parties, including state actors, our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information. This risk is exacerbated as competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire our employees. See also the Risk Factor titled “We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees, and our attempts to fully reopen our offices and operate under a hybrid working environment may not be successful.” Similarly, we provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees and certain of our consultants, who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors. We also provide access to certain of our technology, intellectual property and other proprietary or confidential information to certain of our joint venture partners, including those affiliated with state actors and including in foreign jurisdictions where ownership restrictions may require us to take a minority ownership interest in the joint venture. Such joint venture partners may wrongfully use such technology, intellectual property or information, or wrongfully disclose such technology, intellectual property or information to third parties, including our competitors or state actors.The misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology, intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of us or our employees, customers, licensees, suppliers or other third parties, could harm our competitive position, reduce the value of our investment in research and development and other strategic initiatives, cause us to lose business, damage our reputation, subject us to legal or regulatory proceedings, cause us to incur other loss or liability and otherwise adversely affect our business. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our IT systems, and our technology, intellectual property and proprietary and confidential information.Further, China has implemented, and other countries or regions may implement, cybersecurity laws that require our overall IT security environment to meet certain standards and/or be certified. Such laws may be complex, ambiguous and subject to interpretation, which may create uncertainty regarding compliance. As a result, our efforts to comply with such laws may be expensive and may fail, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. 28RISKS RELATED TO HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT We may not be able to attract and retain qualified employees, and our attempts to fully reopen our offices and operate under a hybrid working environment may not be successful.Our future success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel, and on our ability to continue to identify, attract, retain and motivate them. Implementing our business strategy requires specialized engineering and other talent, as our revenues are highly dependent on technological and product innovations. In addition, in order to extend our business into certain new and expanded product areas and/or industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, we will be required to attract, retain and motivate engineering and other technical personnel with specialized skills in these areas, and these skills are in high demand among our competitors. The market for employees in our industry is extremely competitive, and competitors for talent, particularly engineering talent, increasingly attempt to hire, and to varying degrees have been successful in hiring, our employees or employment candidates, including by establishing or expanding local offices near our headquarters in San Diego, California. Further, the increased availability of remote working arrangements, largely driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, has expanded the pool of companies that can compete for our employees and employment candidates. A number of such competitors for talent are significantly larger than us and are able to offer compensation in excess of what we are able to offer or other benefits that we generally do not offer, such as the ability to permanently work from home. Further, existing immigration laws make it more difficult for us to recruit and retain highly skilled foreign national graduates of universities in the United States, making the pool of available talent even smaller. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified employees, our business may be harmed.The COVID-19 pandemic caused us to modify our workforce practices, including having the vast majority of our employees work from home. As we reopen our offices, we intend to operate under a “hybrid” working environment, meaning that the majority of our employees will have the flexibility to work remotely at least some of the time, for the foreseeable future. The hybrid working environment may impair our ability to maintain our collaborative and innovative culture, and may cause disruptions among our employees, including decreases in productivity, challenges in communications between on-site and off-site employees and, potentially, employee dissatisfaction and attrition. If our attempts to safely reopen our offices and operate under a hybrid working environment are not successful, our business could be adversely impacted.RISKS SPECIFIC TO OUR LICENSING BUSINESS The continued and future success of our licensing programs requires us to continue to evolve our patent portfolio and to renew or renegotiate license agreements that are expiring.We own a very strong portfolio of issued and pending patents related to 3G, 4G, 5G and other technologies. It is critical that we continue to evolve our patent portfolio, particularly in 5G. If we do not maintain a strong portfolio that is applicable to current and future standards, products and services, our future licensing revenues could be negatively impacted.Our patent license agreements in effect that constitute a significant portion of our licensing revenues are effective for a specified term. To receive royalties after the expiration date of the specified term, we will need to extend or modify such license agreements or enter into new license agreements with such licensees. We might not be able to extend or modify license agreements, or enter into new license agreements, in the future without negatively affecting the material terms and conditions of our license agreements with such licensees, and such modifications or new agreements may negatively impact our revenues. In some circumstances, we may extend, modify or enter into new license agreements as a result of arbitration or litigation, and terms imposed by arbitrators or courts may be less favorable to us than existing terms and may impact the financial or other terms of license agreements not subject to the litigation or arbitration. If there is a delay in extending, modifying or entering into a new license agreement with a licensee, there would be a delay in our ability to recognize revenues related to that licensee’s product sales. Further, if we are unable to reach agreement on such modifications or new agreements, it could result in patent infringement litigation with such licensees.Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business. From time to time, companies initiate various strategies to attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property. These strategies have included: (i) litigation, often alleging infringement of patents held by such companies, patent misuse, patent exhaustion, patent invalidity or unenforceability of our patents or licenses, alleging that we do not license our patents on fair, reasonable and nondiscriminatory (FRAND) terms, or alleging some form of unfair competition or competition law violation; (ii) taking positions contrary to our understanding (and/or the plain language) of their contracts with us; (iii) appeals to governmental authorities; (iv) collective action, including working with wireless operators, standards bodies, other like-minded companies and organizations, on both formal and informal bases, to adopt intellectual property policies and practices that could have the effect of limiting returns on intellectual property innovations; (v) lobbying governmental regulators and elected officials for the purpose of seeking the reduction of royalty rates or the base on which royalties are calculated, seeking to impose some form of compulsory licensing or weakening a patent holder’s ability to enforce its rights or obtain a fair return for such rights; and (vi) attempts by licensees to shift their royalty obligation to their suppliers in order to lower the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price on which the royalty is calculated.29In addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.We have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations” and “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings.” In addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standard-compliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.Further, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standard-essential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies’) alleged failure to abide by these policies. Some SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their own.We expect that such proposals, interpretations and strategies will continue in the future, and if successful, our business model would be harmed, either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalties (or by reducing the royalties we can collect) on all or a portion of our standard-essential patent portfolio, limiting our return on investment with respect to new technologies, limiting our ability to seek injunctions against infringers of our standard-essential patents, constraining our ability to make licensing commitments when submitting our technologies for inclusion in future standards (which could make our technologies less likely to be included in such standards) or forcing us to work outside of SDOs or other industry groups to promote our new technologies, and our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, the legal and other costs associated with asserting or defending our positions have been and may in the future be significant. We expect that such challenges, regardless of their merits, will continue into the foreseeable future and will require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources.Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.As described in the Risk Factor below titled “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings,” we have been in the past and may in the future be subject to various governmental investigations and legal proceedings challenging our patent licensing (or chipset sales) practices. We are currently subject to certain governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We believe that one intent of certain of these governmental investigations and legal proceedings has been to reduce the amount of royalties that licensees are required to pay to us for their use of our intellectual property. 30If we were required to reduce the royalty rates in our patent license agreements, our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted absent a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid. Similarly, if we were required to reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be negatively impacted unless there was a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid or we were able to increase our royalty rates to offset the decrease in revenues resulting from such lower royalty base (assuming the absolute royalty dollars were below any relevant royalty caps).If we were required to grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers (which could lead to implementing a more complex, multi-level licensing structure in which we license certain portions of our patent portfolio to chipset manufacturers and other portions to OEMs), we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, and we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed. In addition, our licensing revenues and earnings would be negatively impacted if we were not able to obtain, in the aggregate, equivalent revenues under such a multi-level licensing structure.If we were required to sell chipsets to OEMs that do not have a license to our patents, our licensing program could be negatively impacted by patent exhaustion claims raised by such unlicensed OEMs (i.e., claims that our sale of chipsets to such OEMs forecloses us from asserting any patents substantially embodied by the chipsets against such OEMs). Such sales would provide OEMs with a defense in the event we asserted our patents against them to obtain licensing revenue for those patents. This could have a material adverse effect on our licensing program and our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.To the extent that we were required to implement any of these new licensing and/or business practices, including by modifying or renegotiating our existing license agreements or pursuing other commercial arrangements, we would incur additional transaction costs, which may be significant, we could incur delays in recognizing revenues until license negotiations were completed, and our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be harmed. The impact of any such changes to our licensing practices could vary widely and by jurisdiction, depending on the specific outcomes and the geographic scope of such outcomes. In addition, if we were required to make modifications to our licensing practices in one jurisdiction, licensees or governmental agencies in other jurisdictions may attempt to obtain similar outcomes for themselves or for such other jurisdictions, as applicable, which would result in increased legal costs.RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL CHALLENGES Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings.We have been in the past and are currently subject to various governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” Key allegations or findings in those matters include or have in the past included, among others: that we violate FRAND licensing commitments by refusing to grant licenses to chipset manufacturers; that our royalty rates are too high; that the base on which our royalties are calculated should be something less than the wholesale (i.e., licensee’s) selling price of the applicable device (minus certain permitted deductions); that we unlawfully require customers to execute a patent license before we sell them cellular modem chipsets; that we have entered into exclusive agreements with chipset customers that foreclose competition; that we leverage our position in baseband chipsets in the RFFE space; and that we violate antitrust laws and engage in anticompetitive conduct and unfair methods of competition. We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Depending on the matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others: the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patents; injunctions; monetary damages, fines or other orders to pay money; the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices, such as requiring us to reduce our royalty rates, reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers, sell chipsets to unlicensed OEMs or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreements; and determinations that some or all of our license agreements are invalid or unenforceable. In addition, a governmental body in a particular country or region may successfully assert and impose remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. If some or all of our license agreements are declared invalid or unenforceable and/or we are required to renegotiate these license agreements, we may not receive, or may not be able to recognize, some or any licensing or royalty revenues under the impacted license agreements unless and until we enter into new license agreements; and even licensees whose license agreements are not impacted may demand to renegotiate their agreements or invoke the dispute resolution provision in their agreements, and we may not be able to recognize some or any licensing or royalty revenues under such agreements. The renegotiation of license agreements could result in terms that are less favorable to us than existing terms, or lead to arbitration or litigation to resolve the licensing terms, which could also be less favorable to us than existing terms, and each of which could take months or possibly years. Licensees may underreport, underpay, not report or not pay royalties owed to us pending the conclusion of such negotiations, arbitration or litigation. In addition, we may be sued for alleged overpayments of past royalties paid to us, including private antitrust actions seeking treble damages under U.S. antitrust laws. The occurrence of any of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, and our stock price could decline, possibly significantly, in which case we may have to significantly cut costs and other uses of cash, including in research and development, significantly impairing our ability to maintain product and technology leadership and invest in 31next generation technologies. Further, depending on the breadth and severity of the circumstances above, we may have to reduce, suspend or eliminate our capital return programs, and our ability to timely pay our indebtedness may be impacted. These challenges have required, and may in the future require, the investment of significant management time and attention and have resulted, and may in the future result, in significant legal costs.RISKS RELATED TO INDUSTRY DYNAMICS AND COMPETITIONOur revenues depend on our customers’ and licensees’ sales of products and services based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, including 5G, and customer demand for our products based on these technologies.We develop, patent and commercialize technology and products based on CDMA, OFDMA and other communications technologies, which are primarily wireless. We depend on our customers and licensees to develop devices and services based on these technologies with value-added features to drive consumer demand for new 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices, as well as 4G single-mode devices, and to establish the selling prices for such devices. Further, the timing of our shipments of our products is dependent on the timing of our customers’ and licensees’ deployments of new devices and services based on these technologies. Increasingly, we also depend on operators of wireless networks, our customers and licensees and other third parties to incorporate these technologies into new device types and into industries and applications beyond mobile handsets, such as automotive and IoT, among others.We have historically been successful during wireless technology transitions, including 3G, 4G and now 5G. Commercial deployments of 5G networks and devices have begun and will continue. However, the timing and scale of such deployments, in certain regions, have been and may in the future be delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Our revenues and growth in revenues could be negatively impacted, our business may be harmed and our substantial investments in these technologies may not provide us an adequate return, if: our customers’ and licensees’ revenues and sales of products, particularly premium-tier products, and services using these technologies, and average selling prices of such products, decline due to, for example, the maturity of smartphone penetration in developed regions, including China; we do not continue to maintain our intellectual property and technical leadership in 5G, including in ongoing 5G standardization efforts; we are unable to drive the adoption of our products into networks and devices, including devices beyond mobile handsets; or consumers’ rates of replacement of smartphones and other computing devices decline. Our industry is subject to intense competition in an environment of rapid technological change. Our success depends in part on our ability to adapt to such change and compete effectively; and such change and competition could result in decreased demand for our products and technologies or declining average selling prices for our products or those of our customers or licensees.Our products and technologies face significant competition. Competition may intensify as our current competitors expand their product offerings, improve their products or reduce the prices of their products as part of a strategy to maintain existing business and customers or attract new business and customers, as new opportunities develop, and as new competitors enter the industry. Competition in wireless communications is affected by various factors that include, among others: OEM concentrations; vertical integration; competition in certain geographic regions; government intervention or support of national industries or competitors; the ability to maintain product differentiation as the result of evolving industry standards and speed of technological change (including the transition to smaller geometry process technologies and the demand for always on, always connected capabilities); access to capacity in the supply chain; and value-added features that drive selling prices and consumer demand for new 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices, as well as 3G and 4G single-mode devices.We anticipate that additional competitors will introduce products as a result of growth opportunities in wireless communications, the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors, and technological and public policy changes. Additionally, the semiconductor industry has experienced and may continue to experience consolidation, which could result in significant changes to the competitive landscape. For example, if any key supplier of technologies and intellectual property to the semiconductor industry was sold to one of our competitors, it could negatively affect our ability to procure or license such technologies and intellectual property in the future, at all or upon acceptable terms which could have wide-ranging impacts on our business and operations.We expect that our future success will depend on, among other factors, our ability to:•differentiate our integrated circuit products with innovative technologies across multiple products and features (e.g., modem, radio frequency front-end (RFFE), including millimeter wave (mmWave), graphics and other processors, camera and connectivity) and with smaller geometry process technologies that drive both performance and lower power consumption;•develop and offer integrated circuit products at competitive cost and price points to effectively cover all geographic regions and all device tiers;•continue to be a leader in mobile, and drive the adoption of our technologies and integrated circuit products, including RFFE, into the most popular device models and across a broad spectrum of devices in mobile, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and other mobile computing devices;•increase or accelerate adoption of our technologies and products in industries and applications outside of mobile handsets, including automotive and IoT;32•maintain or accelerate demand for our integrated circuit products at the premium device tier, while also driving the adoption of our products into high, mid- and low-tier devices across all regions;•remain a leader in 5G (and 4G) technology development, standardization, intellectual property creation and licensing, and develop, commercialize and remain a leading supplier of 5G (and 4G) integrated circuit products, including RFFE products; •maintain access to sufficient capacity in the supply chain relative to our competitors to meet customer demand;•create standalone value and contribute to the success of our existing businesses through acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic transactions, and by developing customer, licensee, vendor, distributor and other channel relationships in new industries and applications; •identify potential acquisition targets that will grow or sustain our business or address strategic needs, reach agreement on terms acceptable to us, close the transactions and effectively integrate these new businesses, products and technologies; •provide leading products and technologies to OEMs, high level operating systems (HLOS) providers, operators, cloud providers and other industry participants as competitors, new industry entrants and other factors continue to affect the industry landscape;•be a preferred partner and sustain preferred relationships providing integrated circuit products that support multiple operating system and infrastructure platforms to industry participants that effectively commercialize new devices using these platforms; and•continue to develop brand recognition to effectively compete against better known companies in computing and other consumer driven segments and to deepen our presence in significant emerging regions and China.We compete with many different semiconductor companies, ranging from multinational companies with integrated research and development, manufacturing, sales and marketing organizations across a broad spectrum of product lines, to companies that are focused on a single application, industry or standard product, including those that produce products for mobile handsets, automotive and IoT, among others. Most of these competitors compete with us with respect to some, but not all, of our businesses or product lines. Companies that design integrated circuits based on CDMA, OFDMA, Wi-Fi or their derivatives are generally competitors or potential competitors. Examples (some of which are strategic partners of ours in other areas) include Broadcom, MediaTek, Nvidia, NXP Semiconductors, Qorvo, Samsung, Skyworks, Texas Instruments and UNISOC (formally known as Spreadtrum Communications). Some of these current and potential competitors may have advantages over us that include, among others: motivation by our customers in certain circumstances to use our competitors’ integrated circuit products, to utilize their own internally-developed integrated circuit products and/or sell such products to others, or to utilize alternative technologies; lower cost structures or a willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins for their products, particularly in China; foreign government support of other technologies, competitors or OEMs that sell devices that do not contain our integrated circuit products; better known brand names; ownership and control of manufacturing facilities and greater expertise in manufacturing processes; more extensive relationships with local distribution companies and OEMs in certain geographic regions (such as China); more experience in industries and applications beyond mobile handsets (such as automotive and IoT); and a more established presence in certain regions. In addition, certain of our largest integrated circuit customers have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize our competitors’ integrated circuit products in some (or all) of their devices, rather than our products. Further, certain of those customers have developed, are developing or may develop their own integrated circuit products (effectively making them competitors), which they have in the past utilized, currently utilize and may in the future utilize in some (or all) of their devices, rather than our products. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).” Further, political actions, including trade and/or national security protection policies, or other actions by governments, particularly the U.S. and Chinese governments, have in the past, currently are and could in the future limit or prevent us from transacting business with certain of our customers or suppliers, limit, prevent or discourage certain of our customers or suppliers from transacting business with us, or make it more expensive to do so. This could advantage our competitors by enabling them with increased sales, economies of scale, operating income and/or cash flows and/or enable critical technology transfer, allowing them to increase their investments in technology development, research and development and commercialization of products. See also the Risk Factor titled “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.” Further, certain of our competitors develop and sell multiple components (including integrated circuit products) for use in devices and sell those components together to OEMs. Our competitors’ sales of multiple components put us (and our discrete integrated circuit products) at a competitive disadvantage. Certain of our competitors also develop and sell infrastructure equipment for wireless networks and can optimize their integrated circuit products to perform on such networks to a degree that we are not able to, which again puts us at a competitive disadvantage.Competition in any or all product tiers may result in the loss of business or customers, which would negatively impact our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Such competition may also reduce average selling prices for our chipset products or the products of our customers and licensees. Certain of these dynamics are particularly pronounced in emerging regions and China where competitors may have lower cost structures or may have a 33willingness and ability to accept lower prices or lower margins on their products. Reductions in the average selling prices of our chipset products, without a corresponding increase in volumes, would negatively impact our revenues, and without corresponding decreases in average unit costs, would negatively impact our margins. In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees’ products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues. RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES Failures in our products, or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.Our products (including for purposes of this Risk Factor, related software) are complex and may contain defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system. Development of products in new domains of technology, such as the transition to 5G, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or other unintended functionality could also be introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious actors, either directly or through third-party products or software used in our products or IT infrastructure (including applications). Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use. Risks associated with product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into consumer and other devices.The use of devices containing our products to interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers’ products, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or our customers’ products or IT infrastructure. Such attacks could result in the disruption of our customers’ businesses or the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology or intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of our customers, their employees or the end users of our customers’ devices. While we continue to focus on this issue and take measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities continue to evolve, enabling more elaborate functionality and applications, and increasing the risk of security failures, and techniques used to perpetrate cybersecurity attacks are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.”Our products may be responsible for critical functions in our customers’ products and networks. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, or other product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell to our customers, the devices into which our products are integrated and the end users of such devices, and, potentially, to our customers’ IT infrastructure. Such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities could give rise to significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, repairing or replacing defective products, writing down defective inventory, or indemnification obligations under our agreements, and could result in the loss of sales and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, a loss of design wins, a shifting of business to our competitors, and litigation or regulatory action against us, and could harm our reputation, our relationships with customers and partners and our ability to attract new customers, as well as the perceptions of our brand. Other potential adverse impacts of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities include shipment delays, write-offs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and losses on unfavorable purchase commitments. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in the products of our customers or licensees could cause a delay or decrease in demand for the products into which our products are integrated, and thus for our products.In addition, the occurrence of defects, errors or security vulnerabilities may give rise to product liability claims, particularly if such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products or the technology we use, or the products into which they are integrated, result in personal injury or death, and could result in significant costs, expenses and losses. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant, and could divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and harm our business, even if we are successful. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question, and even though we may have indemnity from our customers, and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate, or future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results. The above is exacerbated by the fact that our products may be used, and perform critical functions, in various high-risk applications such as (i) automobiles, including autonomous driver assistance programs; (ii) cameras and artificial intelligence, including home and enterprise security; (iii) home automation, including smoke and noxious gas detectors; (iv) medical condition monitoring; (v) location and asset tracking and management, including wearables for child safety and elderly health; (vi) robotics, including public safety drones and autonomous municipality vehicles; and (vii) extended reality (XR) for treatment of phobias or PTSD, early detection of disorders or special needs, among others.34Accordingly, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could have an adverse impact on us, on our customers and the end users of our customers’ products. If any of these risks materialize, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.RISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY The enforcement and protection of our intellectual property may be expensive, could fail to prevent misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property, could result in the loss of our ability to enforce one or more patents, and could be adversely affected by changes in patent laws, by laws in certain foreign jurisdictions that may not effectively protect our intellectual property and by ineffective enforcement of laws in such jurisdictions.We rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements, international treaties and other methods, to protect our intellectual property, including our patent portfolio. Policing unauthorized use of our products, technologies and intellectual property is difficult and time consuming. The steps we have taken have not always prevented, and we cannot be certain the steps we will take in the future will prevent, the misappropriation or unauthorized use of our products, technologies or intellectual property, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our rights as fully or as readily as U.S. laws or where the enforcement of such laws may be lacking or ineffective. See also the Risk Factor titled “Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information.”Some industry participants who have a vested interest in devaluing patents in general, or standard-essential patents in particular, have mounted attacks on certain patent systems, increasing the likelihood of changes to established patent laws. In the United States, there is continued discussion regarding potential patent law changes and current and potential future litigation regarding patents, the outcomes of which could be detrimental to our licensing business. The laws in certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including certain countries in Asia, may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States. We cannot predict with certainty the long-term effects of any potential changes. In addition, we cannot be certain that the laws and policies of any country or the practices of any standards bodies, foreign or domestic, with respect to intellectual property enforcement or licensing or the adoption of standards, will not be changed in the future in a way detrimental to our licensing program or to the sale or use of our products or technologies.We have had and may in the future have difficulty in certain circumstances in protecting or enforcing our intellectual property and contracts, including collecting royalties for use of our patent portfolio due to, among others: refusal by certain licensees to report and pay all or a portion of the royalties they owe to us; policies or political actions of governments, including trade protection and national security policies; challenges to our licensing practices under competition laws; adoption of mandatory licensing provisions by foreign jurisdictions; failure of foreign courts to recognize and enforce judgments of contract breach and damages issued by courts in the United States; and challenges before competition agencies to our licensing business and the pricing and integration of additional features and functionality into our chipset products. See also the Risk Factors titled “Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business” and “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings.” We have engaged in litigation and arbitration in the past and may need to further litigate or arbitrate in the future to enforce our contract and intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others. As a result of any such litigation or arbitration, we could lose our ability to enforce one or more patents, portions of our license agreements could be determined to be invalid or unenforceable (which may in turn result in other licensees either not complying with their existing license agreements or initiating litigation or arbitration), license terms (including but not limited to royalty rates for the use of our intellectual property) could be imposed that are less favorable to us than existing terms, and we could incur substantial costs. Any action we take to enforce our contract or intellectual property rights could be costly and could absorb significant management time and attention, which, in turn, could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows. Further, even a positive resolution to our enforcement efforts may take time to conclude, which may reduce our revenues and cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development, in the periods prior to conclusion. Additionally, although our license agreements generally provide us with the right to audit the books and records of licensees, audits can be expensive, time consuming, incomplete and subject to dispute. Further, certain licensees may not comply with the obligation to provide full access to their books and records. To the extent we do not aggressively enforce our rights under our license agreements, licensees may not comply with their existing license agreements, and to the extent we do not aggressively pursue unlicensed companies to enter into license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, other unlicensed companies may not enter into license agreements. Similarly, we provide access to certain of our intellectual property and proprietary and confidential business information to our direct and indirect customers and licensees, who have in the past and may in the future wrongfully use such intellectual property and information or wrongfully disclose such intellectual property and information to third parties, including our competitors. See also the Risk Factor titled “Efforts by some original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) to avoid paying fair and reasonable royalties for the use of our intellectual property may require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources and may result in 35legal decisions or actions by governments, courts, regulators or agencies, Standards Development Organizations (SDOs) or other industry organizations that harm our business.”Claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property could adversely affect our business.From time to time, companies have asserted, and may again assert, patent, copyright or other intellectual property claims against our products or products using our technologies or other technologies used in our industry. These claims have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation. We may not prevail in such litigation given, among other factors, the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products were found to infringe another company’s intellectual property, we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our products, or to license such intellectual property or pay damages or other compensation to such other company (any of which could be costly). If we are unable to redesign our products, license such intellectual property used in our products or otherwise distribute our products (e.g., through a licensed supplier), we could be prohibited from making and selling our products. Similarly, our suppliers could be found to infringe another company’s intellectual property, and such suppliers could then be enjoined from providing products or services to us.In any potential dispute involving us and another company’s patents or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products sold by us, or by intellectual property provided by us to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees’ sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel or cause product release or shipment delays, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.We may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (or on the sale of our customers’ devices using such products) or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our chipset customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees’ sales, causing corresponding declines in our chipset or licensing revenues.Certain legal matters, which may include certain claims by other companies that we infringe their intellectual property, are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”Our use of open source software may harm our business.Certain of our software and our suppliers’ software may contain or may be derived from “open source” software, and we have seen, and believe that we will continue to see, customers request that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of our products’ source code and may expose our related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of that software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Furthermore, in the course of product development, we may make contributions to third-party open source projects that could subject our intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. For example, to encourage the growth of a software ecosystem that is interoperable with our products, we may need to contribute certain implementations under the open source licensing terms that govern such projects, which may adversely impact our associated intellectual property. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property upon which our licensing program depends, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Also, our use and our customers’ use of open source software may subject our products and our customers’ products to governmental and third-party scrutiny and delays in product certification, which could cause customers to view our products as less desirable than our competitors’ products.36GENERAL RISK FACTORS We operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns. We are also susceptible to declines in global, regional and local economic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to these dynamics, among others.The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, volatile, subject to downturns and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. Periods of downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, excess or obsolete inventory adjustments, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and erosion of average selling prices. We expect our business to continue to be subject to such cyclical downturns. Consequently, our revenues may decline, and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted.A decline in global, regional or local economic conditions or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or licensees, could also have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including: a decrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our customers and/or the inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties; and/or negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers’ and licensees’ ability to purchase or pay for our products and intellectual property and network operators’ ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be adversely affected, potentially leading to a reduction, cancellation or delay of orders for our products.Our stock price and financial results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock and our financial results include those identified above and throughout this Risk Factors section, as well as; volatility of the stock market in general and technology and semiconductor companies in particular; announcements concerning us, our suppliers, our competitors or our customers or licensees; and variations between our actual financial results or guidance and expectations of securities analysts or investors, among others. In the past, securities class action litigation has been brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities, among other reasons. We are and may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial uninsured costs and divert management’s attention and our resources. Certain legal matters, including certain securities litigation brought against us, are described more fully in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.”Our business may suffer due to the impact of, or our failure to comply with, the various existing, new or amended laws, regulations, policies or standards to which we are subject.Our business and products, and those of our customers and licensees, are subject to various laws, rules and regulations globally as well as government policies and the specifications of international, national and regional communications standards bodies (collectively, Regulations). These include, among others: Regulations affecting patent licensing practices; antitrust, competition and competitive business practices; the flow of funds out of certain countries (e.g., China); cybersecurity; import and export regulations such as the U.S. Export Administration Regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Commerce; protection of intellectual property; trade and trade protection including tariffs; foreign policy and national security; environmental protection (including climate change), health and safety; supply chain, responsible sourcing, including the use of conflict minerals, and human rights; spectrum availability and license issuance; adoption of standards; taxation; privacy and data protection; labor, employment and human capital; corporate governance; public disclosure; or business conduct. Compliance with, or changes in the interpretation of, existing Regulations, the adoption of new Regulations, changes in the oversight of our activities by governments or standards bodies, or rulings in court, regulatory, administrative or other proceedings relating to such Regulations, including, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. See also the Risk Factors titled “Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings,” “Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations,” “A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions,” “There are numerous risks associated with the operation and control of our manufacturing facilities, including a higher portion of fixed costs relative to a fabless model; environmental compliance and liability; impacts related to climate change; exposure to natural disasters, health crises and cyber-attacks; timely supply of equipment and materials; and various manufacturing issues,” and “Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.”Regulations are complex and changing (which may create uncertainty regarding compliance), are subject to varying interpretations, and their application in practice may evolve over time. As a result, our efforts to comply with Regulations may fail, particularly if there is ambiguity as to how they should be applied in practice. Failure to comply with any Regulation may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. New Regulations, or evolving interpretations thereof, may cause us to incur higher costs as we revise current practices, policies or procedures and may divert management time and attention to compliance activities.37There are risks associated with our debt.Our outstanding debt and any additional debt we incur may have negative consequences on our business, including, among others: requiring us to use cash to pay the principal of and interest on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of cash available for other purposes; limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends, general corporate or other purposes; and limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, industries or the market. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance, which is subject to economic and political conditions, industry cycles and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt, we may be required to, among other things: refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt; reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures; reduce, suspend or eliminate our dividend payments and/or our stock repurchase program; or sell selected assets. Such measures might not be sufficient to enable us to service our debt. In addition, any such refinancing, restructuring or sale of assets might not be available on economically favorable terms or at all, and if prevailing interest rates at the time of any such refinancing or restructuring are higher than our current rates, interest expense related to such refinancing or restructuring would increase. Further, if there are adverse changes in the ratings assigned to our debt securities by credit rating agencies, our borrowing costs, our ability to access debt financing in the future and the terms of such debt could be adversely affected.Tax liabilities could adversely affect our results of operations.We are subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. We regularly are subject to examination of our tax returns and reports by taxing authorities in the United States federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, most notably in countries where we earn a routine return and the tax authorities believe substantial value-add activities are performed, as well as countries where we own intellectual property. The final determination of tax audits and any related legal proceedings could materially differ from amounts reflected in our income tax provisions and accruals. In such case, our income tax provision, results of operations and cash flows in the period or periods in which that determination is made could be negatively affected.Tax rules may change in a manner that adversely affects our future reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business. In response to the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and to better align our profits with our activities, we implemented certain restructuring in fiscal 2018 and 2019. After our restructuring, most of our income is taxable in the United States with a significant portion qualifying for preferential treatment as FDII (foreign-derived intangible income). Beginning in fiscal 2027, the effective tax rate for FDII increases from 13% to 16%. Further, if U.S. tax rates increase and/or the FDII deduction is eliminated or reduced, both of which have been proposed by the current U.S. presidential administration and Congress, our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely (potentially materially) affected beginning as early as the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Also, if our customers move manufacturing operations to the United States, our FDII deduction may be reduced. We have tax incentives in Singapore that require we meet specified employment and other criteria. Although our profit in Singapore has declined as a result of our 2018 restructuring and such tax incentives were not significant beginning in fiscal 2019, failure to meet these incentive requirements through March 2022 could require us to refund previously realized material tax benefits for 2017 and 2018.Further changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project that was undertaken by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, recommended changes to numerous long-standing tax principles related to transfer pricing and continues to develop new proposals including allocating greater taxing rights to countries where customers are located and establishing a minimum tax on global income. These changes, as adopted by countries, may increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and cash flows. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff CommentsNone.Item 2. PropertiesAt September 26, 2021, we occupied the following facilities (square footage in millions):United StatesOther CountriesTotalOwned facilities4.5 0.3 4.8 Leased facilities1.0 6.4 7.4 Total5.5 6.7 12.2 Our headquarters and certain research and development and network management hub operations are located in San Diego, California. We also operate leased manufacturing facilities in Germany, China and Singapore; and we own and lease properties around the world for use as sales and administrative offices and research and development centers, primarily in the United States, India and China. Our facility leases expire at varying dates through 2032, not including renewals that are at our 38option. Several other owned and leased facilities are under construction totaling approximately 960 thousand additional square feet, primarily related to the construction of new facilities in India and Taiwan.We do not identify or allocate facilities by operating segment. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning in fiscal 2020, we modified certain of our workforce practices, such as having the vast majority of our employees work from home. Such changes have impacted the physical utilization of certain of our non-manufacturing facilities during both fiscal 2021 and 2020; however, we believe that collectively our facilities are suitable and adequate for our present purposes. We have commenced a phased approach to returning our employees onsite, which included modifications to certain of our facilities as we adapt to a hybrid work environment. We are utilizing the feedback and insights gained through such phased approach taken to reopening our offices to assess the suitability, adequacy, productive capacity and utilization of our existing principal properties, which may result in changes to our physical property needs in the future. Information related to our additional capital requirements is provided in this Annual Report in “Part II, Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in the “Liquidity and Capital Resources” section under the heading “Additional Capital Requirements.” Additional information on net property, plant and equipment by geography is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 8. Segment Information.” Item 3. Legal and Regulatory ProceedingsInformation regarding legal and regulatory proceedings is provided in this Annual Report in “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.” We are also engaged in numerous other legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business (such as, for example, proceedings relating to employment matters or the initiation or defense of proceedings relating to intellectual property rights), and while there can be no assurance, we believe that the ultimate outcome of these other legal actions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.Item 4. Mine Safety DisclosuresNot applicable.39PART IIItem 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesMarket Information and DividendsOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (NASDAQ) under the symbol “QCOM.” At November 1, 2021, there were 6,511 holders of record of our common stock. We intend to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends, subject to capital availability and our view that cash dividends are in the best interests of our stockholders. Future dividends may be affected by, among other items, our views on potential future capital availability and requirements, including those relating to research and development, creation and expansion of sales and distribution channels, investments and acquisitions, legal and regulatory risks, withholding of payments by one or more of our significant licensees and/or customers, fines and/or adverse rulings by government agencies, courts or arbitrators in legal or regulatory matters, stock repurchase programs, debt issuances, changes in federal, state or foreign income tax law, trade and/or national security protection policies, volatility in economies and financial markets globally and changes to our business model.Issuer Purchases of Equity SecuritiesOur purchases of our equity securities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 were:Total Number ofShares PurchasedAverage Price Paid Per Share (1)Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or ProgramsApproximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet BePurchased Under the Plans or Programs (2)(In thousands)(In thousands)(In millions)June 28, 2021 to July 25, 2021— $— — $2,019 July 26, 2021 to August 22, 20211,247 146.31 1,247 1,836 August 23, 2021 to September 26, 20214,164 141.32 4,164 1,248 Total5,411 5,411 (1) Average Price Paid Per Share excludes cash paid for commissions.(2) On July 26, 2018, we announced a stock repurchase program authorizing us to repurchase up to $30.0 billion of our common stock. On October 12, 2021, we announced a new $10.0 billion stock repurchase authorization, which is in addition to the remaining repurchase authority of $0.9 billion under the aforementioned program. The stock repurchase programs have no expiration date. Since September 26, 2021, we repurchased and retired 5.4 million shares of common stock for $703 million. Shares withheld to satisfy statutory tax withholding requirements related to the vesting of share-based awards are not issued or considered stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program and, therefore, are excluded from the table above.Unregistered Sales of Equity SecuritiesIn January 2021, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Merger Agreement) for the acquisition of NuVia, Inc. (NUVIA), which transaction closed in March 2021. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, we are obligated to issue shares of our common stock to three specific founders of NUVIA and certain affiliated entities of such founders from time to time upon the satisfaction of certain conditions specified in the Merger Agreement. During the quarter ended September 26, 2021, we issued an aggregate of 104,499 additional shares of our common stock to the three founders of NUVIA and their affiliates, each of whom had advised us that he or such entity was an accredited investor. These shares were issued in transactions not involving a public offering pursuant to the exemption from registration set forth in Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act.Item 6. (Reserved)Item 7.
