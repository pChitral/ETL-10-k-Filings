1141391,MA,Mastercard Inc,2004,Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations 24 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk 37,2023-12-30 16:53:16.448012
1141391,MA,Mastercard Inc,2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard International”) and MasterCard Europe sprl (“MasterCard Europe”)(together, “MasterCard” or the “Company”) included elsewhere in this Report. Forward-Looking Statements This Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. When used in this Report, the words “believe,” “expect,” “could,” “may,” “will” and similar words are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements relate to our future prospects, developments and business strategies. Many factors and uncertainties relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are outside of our control, influence whether any forward-looking statements can or will be achieved. Any one of those factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in writing in any forward-looking statements made by MasterCard or on its behalf. We believe there are certain risk factors that are important to our business, and that could cause actual results to differ from our expectations. Please see a complete discussion of these risk factors under the caption “Risk Factors” in Item 1 — Business of this Report. Overview Our corporate strategy has been to focus on our key customers to drive our business growth; to strengthen our brands, technology and acceptance network; and to differentiate MasterCard from our competition by developing innovative payment solutions and customized consulting services. We remain committed to this strategic direction and have begun to implement initiatives to expand our customer-focused approach to a broader group of customers, as well as to further develop relationships with merchants that accept our cards. We will also seek to leverage our expertise in payment programs, consulting services, brand marketing, technology and processing to expand the value-added services we provide our customers. We also intend to proactively address the legal, regulatory and other industry risks that impact our business. In a challenging operating environment with legal, economic and industry pressures, we were able to exceed our planned revenue growth and attain our expense objectives in 2004. We achieved double-digit revenue growth of 14% in 2004 from the comparable period in 2003, adjusted for a 2% impact of favorable foreign currency fluctuation against the euro. The increase in revenue was due to higher gross dollar volume (“GDV”) and more transactions processed by MasterCard, primarily from the expansion of our customer relationships, economic recovery in many countries and higher cross-border travel. In 2003, our revenues were negatively impacted by the war in Iraq, the SARS outbreak, reduced travel and a general economic slowdown worldwide. During 2004, we continued to realign our operations and limit the growth of our operating expenses through successful vendor negotiations. Our operating expenses increased 7% in 2004, excluding the impact of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, of which 1% was due to the impact of acquisitions during 2004. In 2004, the translation of MasterCard Europe’s operating results from euro into U.S. dollar combined with the devaluation of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro resulted in a 2% increase in both revenues and operating expenses compared to 2003. We reduced our operating expenses as a percentage of 23 Table of Contents total revenues to 86% from 93% in 2003, excluding the impact of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements. Our financial position reflects strong liquidity. We have $1.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities and $975 million in stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2004. We intend to continue to focus on building our financial position. We believe our cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our initiatives to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard in 2005. We successfully completed our Sarbanes-Oxley 404 testing one year ahead of the required deadline for non-accelerated filers with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The consolidated financial statements herein include a report from management which concludes that, based on our assessment, our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2004.

(“EPI”)), on June 28, 2002, affected the comparability of our financial data. The results of MasterCard Europe’s operations have 24 Table of Contents been included in our consolidated statements of operations from June 28, 2002. However, MasterCard Europe’s GDV and transactions are included in all periods. Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Quarterly assessment fees are calculated based on local dollar volume which is converted to U.S. dollar volume using average exchange rates for the quarter. In 2004, the increase in GDV of 14% on a U.S. dollar converted basis exceeded local GDV growth of 11%, resulting in increased assessment revenues due to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. In addition, consumer behavior, particularly international travel and purchases, varies with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We are especially impacted by the movements of the euro to the U.S. dollar since MasterCard Europe’s functional currency is the euro. The devaluation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the impact of the translation of MasterCard Europe’s operating results into U.S. dollar amounts are summarized below: 2004 2003 2002 Euro to U.S. dollar average exchange rate $ 1.2383 $ 1.1277 $ .9902 (1) Devaluation of U.S. dollar to euro 10 % 14 % Revenue growth attributable to translation of MasterCard Europe revenues to U.S. dollars 2 % 2 % Operating expense growth attributable to translation of MasterCard Europe expenses to U.S. dollars 2 % 1 % (1) Average in 2002 is from June 28, 2002, the date of our acquisition of Europay International. Revenues Our revenues are generated from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment services, and from assessments calculated on the dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands. We establish standards and procedures for the acceptance and settlement of our customer transactions on a global basis. We do not issue cards, set fees, or determine the interest rates consumers will be charged on cards carrying our brands. Our issuing customers have the responsibility for determining these and most other competitive card features. Our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. Certain revenues are estimated based upon aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance. MasterCard enters into business agreements with certain customers that provide for fee rebates when those customers meet certain performance based criteria. Such rebates are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the discounted rates for the services provided. In addition, MasterCard enters into agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide GDV-based and other performance support incentives. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period as the revenue is earned or the performance has occurred. The U.S. remains our largest geographic market based on revenues. However, international revenues grew at a faster rate than U.S. revenues in 2004, particularly in the European region. Accordingly, revenue generated in the U.S. was approximately 58%, 63% and 61% of total revenues in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The growth in the European region is primarily due to new assessment revenue streams and increased transactions. No individual country, other than the U.S., generated more than 10% of total revenues in either period. In addition to the expansion of our business relationships and the global recovery in cross-border travel, we believe that our 2004 revenue growth was positively impacted by the worldwide trend in which payments are migrating from paper-based forms to electronic forms such as payment cards. This trend has helped drive our volume and revenue growth for a number of years, and we expect it to continue in 2005. However, we expect our net revenue growth in 2005 to be moderated by pricing arrangements with certain large customers. 25 Table of Contents These pricing arrangements reflect enhanced competition in the global payments industry and the continued consolidation and globalization of our key customers and merchants. Operations Fees Operations fees primarily represent user fees for authorization, clearing, settlement and other payment services that facilitate transaction and information management among our customers on a global basis. Operations fees increased $206 million or 14% in 2004 and $199 million or 16% in 2003, in each case compared to the prior year. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $111 million or 56% of the increase in operations fees in 2003. The significant changes in operations fees were as follows: Change in Revenue Increase (Decrease) 2004 2003 (In millions) Authorization, settlement and switch $ 128 $ 172 Currency conversion 47 30 Consulting 19 — Customer/ Cardholder services 17 6 Research subscriptions 8 — Excessive chargeback penalties (12 ) 15 Other operations fees 25 (8 ) Gross operations fees change $ 232 $ 215 Increase in rebates (26 ) (16 ) Net operations fees change $ 206 $ 199 • Authorization, settlement and switch revenues increased $128 million, or 16%, in 2004 and $172 million, or 28% in 2003. These revenues are driven by the number of transactions processed through our systems, which increased 23% and 13% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In the third quarter 2003, MasterCard began processing the Switch brand in the U.K. which has significantly impacted processed transactions growth. Excluding Switch transactions, processed transaction growth would have been 13% and 10% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2003, a significant portion of the increase in these revenues was due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. In 2004 and 2003, the volatility of exchange rates contributed to increased trading settlement revenue of $16 million and $33 million, respectively. • Currency conversion revenues increased $47 million in 2004 and $30 million in 2003. These revenues are the result of cross-border transactions by cardholders that require currency conversion to settle the transactions between issuers and acquirers. Accordingly, these revenues fluctuate with cross-border travel. While the conflict in Iraq, threat of terrorism and outbreak of SARS negatively impacted cross-border travel in the beginning of 2003, travel increased significantly in the latter part of 2003 and in 2004. In 2003, the increase was principally due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. • Consulting fees are primarily generated by MasterCard Advisors, our advisory services group. During 2004, the incremental consulting revenue is primarily the result of the acquisition of two consulting firms. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. • Customer/ Cardholder services include revenue earned for providing enhanced services to our customers or their cardholders. Examples of these services are telecommunication assistance, ATM locator and concierge programs. These revenues increased due to an overall increase in the demand for our programs and services. 26 Table of Contents • Research subscriptions are generated by MasterCard Advisors, our advisory services group. In 2004, this represents a new revenue stream that resulted from the acquisition of a consulting firm in 2004. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. • Excessive chargeback fees are charged to acquiring banks with merchants that experience a high level of disputed claims from their customers. During 2004 and 2003, customers were assessed fees of $13 million and $25 million, respectively, for excessive chargebacks in accordance with MasterCard rules. The decrease in excessive chargeback fees in 2004 was the result of the imposition of such fees on one large acquiring customer in 2003 in connection with its merchant activity, in accordance with the MasterCard rules. • Other operations fees represent various revenue streams including system services, compliance, sales of holograms, manuals and publications. The change in any individual revenue line is not considered material. • Rebates are primarily based on transactions and volumes and, accordingly, increase as these variables increase. Rebates to certain customers continued to increase in 2004, particularly in the United States, due to ongoing consolidation of our customers and increasingly intense competition. Accordingly, rebates as a percentage of gross operations fees increased to 7% in 2004 compared to 6% in 2003. Assessments Assessments are charges that are calculated based on our customers’ GDV. GDV represents gross usage (purchase and cash disbursements) on cards carrying our brands for goods and services including balance transfers and convenience checks. In 2004 and 2003, assessments revenue grew $156 million, or 20% and $140 million, or 21%, respectively. GDV growth was 11% and 6% in 2004 and 2003, respectively, when measured in local currency and 14% and 10%, respectively, when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $94 million or 68% of the increase in assessments in 2003; excluding MasterCard Europe, assessments revenue growth was 8% in 2003. In addition to the increase in GDV, assessments grew due to the following factors: • In certain countries in Europe and Latin America, our customers are charged a marketing assessment fee based on volume. These fees are used by MasterCard to expand new and existing market development programs to promote the MasterCard brand in these countries. These fees, which were extended to additional countries in 2003 and 2004, increased $28 million or 37% in 2004 and $49 million or 185% in 2003. • Assessment rates vary based on the nature of the transactions that generate the GDV. In 2004, there was stronger growth in international volumes and purchase volumes, which are assessed at higher rates than domestic volumes and cash volumes, respectively. As described above, rebates and incentives provided to our customers and merchants increased in 2004 and 2003. These rebates and incentives reduce revenue, moderate assessments growth and are generally based on GDV, as well as a fixed component for the issuance of new cards or the launch of new programs. Rebates and incentives increased $29 million and $72 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 29% and 31% in 2004 and 2003, respectively. During 2004 and 2003, we increased the incentives offered to certain customers and merchants to promote usage and acceptance of our brands. Additionally, the increase in rebates in 2003 can be attributed to the addition of new member contracts by MasterCard Europe subsequent to its acquisition by MasterCard. 27 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and market development, U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2004, there was a decrease in operating expenses of $587 million or 21% compared to the prior year. Excluding the charges to earnings related to the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, there would have been an increase in operating expenses of $154 million or 7% in 2004 compared to the prior year. Approximately $31 million of the increase in 2004 related to the acquisition of the two consulting firms described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. In 2003, there was an increase in operating expenses of $1.1 billion or 62% compared to the prior year, of which $763 million or 70% was a result of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and $197 million or 18% was due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel, professional fees, data processing, telecommunications and travel. In 2004 and 2003, these activities accounted for approximately 46% and 49% of total revenues, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased $87 million in 2004 and $134 million in 2003, primarily due to increases in personnel expenses. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $110 million or 82% of the increase in general and administrative expenses in 2003. The major components of changes in general and administrative expenses are as follows: Change Increase (Decrease) 2004 2003 (In millions) Personnel $ 52 $ 98 Professional fees 30 10 Telecommunications (13 ) 1 Data processing 5 10 Travel 5 2 Other 8 13 Net general and administrative change $ 87 $ 134 • Personnel expense increased in 2004 primarily due to performance and merit increases resulting from better than anticipated performance against company objectives and the acquisition of the two consulting firms described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. In 2003, the increase was primarily due to a full year of salaries and benefits as compared to six months in 2002 resulting from the acquisition of MasterCard Europe. • Professional fees increased in 2004 primarily due to consulting services utilized in developing our strategic initiatives and services related to compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. • Telecommunications expense decreased in 2004 as a result of our ongoing evaluation of telecommunication needs, including renegotiation of certain contracts with service providers. • Data processing consists of expenses to operate and maintain MasterCard’s computer systems. These expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage. • Travel expenses are incurred primarily for travel to customer and regional meetings and accordingly vary with business activity. • Other includes rental expense for our facilities, foreign exchange gains and losses, impairment expense and other miscellaneous administrative expenses. 28 Table of Contents Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development consists of expenses associated with advertising, marketing, promotions and sponsorships, which promote our brand and assist our customers in achieving their goals by raising consumer awareness and usage of cards carrying our brands. In 2004 and 2003, these activities accounted for approximately 35% and 38% of total revenues, respectively. Advertising and market development expenses increased $65 million or 8% in 2004 and $157 million or 23% in 2003. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $70 million or 45% of the increase in advertising and market development expenses in 2003. Our brands, principally MasterCard, are valuable strategic assets which convey symbols that can be readily identified by our customers, as well as our cardholders, creating value for our business. Our advertising and marketing efforts are focused on ensuring that our services are identified, communicated and marketed in a clear, efficient and consistent manner, not only on a local level, but also on a global scale. We are committed to maintaining and enhancing our MasterCard brand reputation, image and ultimate value. Our “Priceless” campaign has run in 96 countries and 48 languages and we continue to invest significantly in this campaign. In 2004, increased media advertising occurred in our European region. In addition, MasterCard has corporate sponsorships and conducts promotions to generate usage of cards carrying our brands. During 2004 and 2003, we sponsored the UEFA Champions League, certain National Football League teams, Major League Baseball, the Professional Golf Association and Universal Studios. MasterCard implemented a four-year plan in 2002 to accelerate our growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard and its customers by significantly expanding its spending in advertising and market development. For the year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, we spent $192 million and $152 million on advertising and marketing relating to this plan. The primary focus of these initiatives is to build brand recognition, promote brand acceptance and enhance the development of our programs and services in certain markets. We will continue to evaluate the extent of these initiatives in light of changing market conditions. Merchant Lawsuit and Other Legal Settlements In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $721 million ($469 million after-tax) consisting of (i) the monetary amount of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement (discounted at 8 percent over the payment term), (ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in order to comply with, other requirements of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement, and (iii) costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. The $721 million pre-tax charge amount was an estimate, which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court, and other factors. In addition, other legal settlements were made in 2004 and 2003. Total liabilities for the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements changed as follows: Balance as of December 31, 2002 $ — U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements 763 Interest accretion 43 Payments (134 ) Balance as of December 31, 2003 672 Currency conversion court award of plaintiff attorney’s fees 14 Other legal settlements and revisions of U.S. merchant lawsuit opt-out estimate 8 Interest accretion 51 Payments (149 ) Other 2 Balance as of December 31, 2004 $ 598 29 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $2 million in 2004 and $29 million in 2003. In 2003, depreciation and amortization expense increased significantly due to the acquisition of MasterCard Europe as well as additional capitalized computer software. The acquisition of MasterCard Europe accounted for $17 million or 59% of the increase in depreciation and amortization in 2003. Our business is dependent on the technology that we use to process transactions. This technology is continuously updated and improved. Therefore, our investment in capitalized software and related amortization also continues to increase. In recent years we have made the following significant changes to our technology and technology centers, which have caused an increase in our depreciation and amortization: • During 2003, our co-processing technology center was moved from Lake Success, NY to Kansas City, MO. The cost of the new facility and equipment was $36 million. • During 2004 and 2003, we continued to invest in our System Enhancement Strategy, an upgrade of all of MasterCard’s core systems to improve productivity and lower overall processing costs. Other Income and Expense Other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income and interest expense. Investment income decreased $8 million in 2004 and increased $31 million in 2003. The decrease in 2004 resulted from a decline in the market value of our trading securities portfolio. The increase in 2003 was primarily due to the consolidation of the variable interest entity (see the discussion in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein) and appreciation of the market value of our trading securities portfolio. Interest expense increased $7 million and $53 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively, primarily due to interest expense of $51 million and $43 million, respectively, related to imputed interest on the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement. In addition, in 2003 the consolidation of the variable interest entity increased interest expense. 30 Table of Contents Income Taxes The effective income tax expense (benefit) rate for years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 was 26.5%, (36.1)% and 26.5%, respectively. The decrease in the rate in 2004 was primarily attributable to the settlement and reassessment of various tax audit matters, the filing and recognition of refund claims and a one-time increase in our deferred state tax assets as a result of additional income subject to higher state and local tax rates. The 2003 tax benefit was primarily driven by the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement. The amount of the litigation settlement and its impact on pretax income was so large that the permanent differences did not significantly affect the tax rate, resulting in a tax benefit at the highest marginal rate. The increase in the rate from 2002 to 2003 was primarily attributable to a one-time revaluation in 2002 of MasterCard Europe’s deferred tax liabilities due to the reduction in the Belgium statutory tax rate from 40.2% to 34.0% in December 2002. The components impacting the effective tax rate are: For the Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Dollar Dollar Dollar Amount Percent Amount Percent Amount Percent (In millions) (In millions) (In millions) Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) and cumulative effect of accounting change $ 324 $ (612 ) $ 158 Federal statutory tax (benefit) $ 113 35.0 % $ (214 ) (35.0 )% $ 55 35.0 % State tax effect, net of Federal benefit 4 1.3 % 2 0.3 % 6 3.9 % Foreign tax effect, net of Federal benefit 4 1.2 % (4 ) (0.6 )% (3 ) (1.7 )% Non-deductible expenses and other differences 4 1.0 % 2 0.3 % 5 2.7 % Tax exempt income (7 ) (2.1 )% (7 ) (1.1 )% (7 ) (4.4 )% Adjustment to deferred tax for change in tax rate: United States — state (8 ) (2.6 )% — — — — Foreign — — — — (11 ) (6.9 )% Refund claims and settlement of audit matters: United States (11 ) (3.4 )% — — — — Foreign (13 ) (3.9 )% — — (3 ) (2.1 )% Income tax expense (benefit) $ 86 26.5 % $ (221 ) (36.1 )% $ 42 26.5 % 31 Table of Contents Liquidity We believe our ability to generate cash to reinvest in our business is one of our fundamental financial strengths. We need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development, to provide for credit and settlement risk, to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and the settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit. At December 31, 2004, we had $1.1 billion of cash, cash equivalents and available for sale securities with which to manage operations, compared to $880 million at December 31, 2003. We expect that the cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating, working capital and capital needs in 2005. In addition, we believe that our resources are sufficient to fund our initiatives to accelerate our profitable growth and to enhance the global position of MasterCard in 2005. However, our liquidity could be negatively impacted by the outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See “Legal, Regulatory and Other Industry Risks.” Percent Change 2004 vs. 2003 vs. 2004 2003 2002 2003 2002 (In millions, except ratio) Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 344 $ 190 $ 310 81.1 % (38.7 )% Net cash used in investing activities (275 ) (170 ) (213 ) (61.8 )% 20.2 % Net cash used in financing activities — — (35 ) ** ** Balance Sheet Data: Current assets $ 1,903 $ 1,610 $ 1,456 18.2 % 10.6 % Current liabilities 1,301 1,189 930 9.4 % 27.8 % Long-term liabilities 984 1,009 307 (2.5 )% 228.7 % Equity 975 699 1,023 39.5 % (31.7 )% Working capital ratio 1.46 1.35 1.57 ** — Not meaningful Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 and 2003 was generated principally by current period earnings (losses) exclusive of non-cash charges for depreciation and amortization and legal settlements. The liabilities related to the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement and other legal settlements discussed in Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein will be funded through existing cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations and our borrowing capacity. We recorded expense of $22 million and $763 million for legal settlement costs in 2004 and 2003, respectively, and had related cash payments totaling $149 million and $134 million, respectively. The utilization of cash for investing activities in 2004 was primarily due to purchases of available-for-sale securities and the acquisition of certain businesses as described in Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. In 2004 and 2003, we also invested in the internal development of capitalized software and purchase of fixed assets to support our business. Our capitalized software is essential to providing payment card transaction processing to our customers through our proprietary global computer and telecommunications system. Our investing activities in 2003 included funding for a co-processing facility in Kansas City, Missouri, and associated equipment. In addition to our liquid investments, we provide for liquidity through a committed $1.95 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with certain financial institutions which expires on June 17, 2005. The Credit Facility replaced MasterCard Incorporated’s prior $1.2 billion credit facility which expired on June 18, 2004. Borrowings under the Credit Facility are available to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by MasterCard International members and, subject to a limit of $300 million, for general corporate purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus 28 basis points. An additional 10 basis points would be applied if the aggregate 32 Table of Contents borrowings under the Credit Facility exceed 33% of the commitments. MasterCard agreed to pay a facility fee which varies based on MasterCard’s credit rating and is currently equal to 7 basis points on the total commitment. MasterCard was in compliance with the Credit Facility covenants as of December 31, 2004. There were no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2004. The majority of Credit Facility lenders are members or affiliates of members of MasterCard International. Due to Standard & Poor’s assessment of MasterCard’s vulnerability to legal risk, on May 16, 2003, Standard & Poor’s lowered MasterCard’s counterparty credit rating to A-/A-2, subordinated debt rating to BBB+ and placed MasterCard on negative outlook. These ratings were reaffirmed in 2004. This rating has not materially impacted our liquidity. Legal, Regulatory and Other Industry Risks Our business has many industry risks, most significantly the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate. These risks have increased in recent years, although we are proactively seeking to address them. For a complete description of the risks facing our business; see “Risk Factors” in Item 1 — Business of this Report. The following risks, among others, may have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition: • Legal and Regulatory Proceedings — MasterCard is a party to several legal and regulatory proceedings, as discussed in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, which could have a material adverse impact on our business. Many of the legal and regulatory proceedings to which we are subject are supported by merchants, who have a growing role in the global payments industry. See “Merchant Acceptance Initiatives” in Item 1 — Business of this Report. • Competition and Consolidation of Our Customers — We are, and will continue to be, significantly dependent on our relationships with our issuers, acquirers and merchants. Most of our relationships with our customers are not exclusive and may be terminated at the convenience of our customers. In addition, the consolidation and globalization of our customers has provided more intense competition and greater demand for rebates, incentives and reduced pricing for our services. The consolidation or merger of one or more of our customers with financial institutions aligned with our competitors could have a material adverse impact on our revenues. • Economic — Our business is dependent on certain world economies and consumer behaviors. In the past, our revenues have been impacted by specific events such as the war in Iraq, the SARS outbreak and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack. The tsunami in Asia did not impact our 2004 revenue; however we intend to closely monitor the impact as the recovery from the tsunami evolves in 2005. 33 Table of Contents Future Obligations The following table summarizes as of December 31, 2004 our obligations that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances. Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Total 1 Year 2-3 Years 4-5 Years 5 Years (In millions) Capital leases(a) $ 63 $ 9 $ 8 $ 4 $ 42 Operating leases(b) 123 37 55 29 2 Sponsorship, licensing & other(c) 570 254 251 52 13 U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements(d) 829 129 200 200 300 Debt(e) 250 5 11 234 — Total $ 1,835 $ 434 $ 525 $ 519 $ 357 (a) Most capital leases relate to certain property, plant and equipment used in our business. Our largest capital lease relates to our Kansas City, Missouri co-processing facility. (b) We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business, including the lease on our facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements. (c) Amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the MasterCard brand. The amounts included are fixed and non-cancelable. In addition, these amounts include purchase obligations. Obligations which result from performance based agreements with our members and merchants have been excluded from the table due to their contingent nature. (d) Represents amounts due in accordance with legal settlements entered into during 2003 and refined in 2004, including the settlement agreement in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. (e) Debt primarily represents principal and interest owed on our subordinated notes due June 2008 and the principal owed on our Series A Senior Secured Notes due September 2009. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. We also have various credit facilities for which there were no outstanding balances at December 31, 2004 that, among other things, would provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our members. Our debt obligations would change if one or more of our members failed and we borrowed under these credit facilities to settle on our members’ behalf or for other reasons. Member Relationships and Related Parties We have a diversified member base of approximately 2,200 principal members and approximately 21,500 affiliate members. Our stockholders are principal members of MasterCard International. In the normal course of business, we enter into transactions with our members and operate a system for authorizing, clearing and settling payment transactions among the members of MasterCard International. One customer, JP Morgan Chase Bank generated 12% of our revenue in 2004. In addition, certain other customers generate in excess of five percent of our revenue. The loss of any of these members could adversely impact MasterCard’s net income. In addition, as part of our business initiative to grow our business, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with members. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to permit members in the United States that have entered into agreements with us to terminate those agreements without penalty as a result of the antitrust litigation brought against us by the U.S. Department of Justice. Any termination of these agreements could have an adverse impact on our financial condition. However, we believe 34 Table of Contents that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the termination of any member business agreements would have on our results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Effect if Actual Results Differ Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used from Assumptions Revenue Recognition Certain revenues are estimated. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein contains a complete discussion of our revenue recognition policies. Certain revenues are recorded based on an estimate of our customers’ performance. Such estimates are subsequently validated against performance reported by our customers. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. Customers’ performance is estimated by using historical performance, member reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers. If our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Rebates and incentives are estimated. Rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra- revenue based on our estimate of each customer’s performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements. If our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, contra-revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Legal and Regulatory Matters We are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. Except as described in Notes 14 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“SFAS No. 5”). Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. 35 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Effect if Actual Results Differ Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used from Assumptions Discount Rate for Merchant Lawsuit Settlement Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein contains a complete discussion of the Merchant Lawsuit. We estimated the discount rate we used to calculate the present value of our obligations under the Settlement Agreement to be 8% for the year ended December 31, 2003. The discount rate used was a matter of management judgment at the time of the settlement, which considered our expected post-settlement credit rating and rates for sources of credit that could be used to finance the payment of such obligations with similar terms. A 1% increase in the discount rate would increase annual interest expense by approximately $4 million in 2005, and declining amounts thereafter. A 1% decrease in the discount rate would decrease annual interest expense by approximately $4 million in 2005, and declining amounts thereafter. In addition, a 1% change in the discount rate would have impacted the amount we recorded as an after-tax charge for the year ended December 31, 2003 by approximately $20 million. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (except Capitalized Software) We perform analyses of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or if indicators of impairment exist. This evaluation utilizes a two-step approach. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over fair value. In performing the analyses, we primarily utilize independent valuation experts. The test methods employed involve assumptions concerning interest and discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. The assumptions employed are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data. During 2004, the Company identified and recorded impairment losses of approximately $7 million for one of the acquisitions completed in 2004. We completed our annual impairment testing for all other goodwill and intangibles using the methodology described herein, and determined there was no impairment. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with goodwill and/or intangible assets. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, excluding capitalized software, was $426 million as of December 31, 2004. 36 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Effect if Actual Results Differ Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used from Assumptions Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate we need to make decisions regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We have various tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and credits, the establishment of reserves for audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ, which could be material. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we realize a deferred tax asset in excess of the net deferred tax asset or we were unable to realize a net deferred tax asset; an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase or decrease earnings, respectively, in the period. Capitalized Software Our capitalized software, which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use, is included in other intangible assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets herein. We are required to make judgments to determine if each project will satisfy its intended use. In addition, we estimate the average internal costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by department for the employees who directly devote time relating to the design, development and testing phases of the project. During the year, no significant impairment charges were recorded. However, if actual results are not consistent with our judgments, we may be exposed to an impairment charge. The net carrying value of capitalized software as of December 31, 2004 was $120 million. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein contains a complete discussion of our accounting policies for intangible assets. On an ongoing basis, we perform impairment analyses on various technologies. If the carrying value of the various technologies exceeds the fair value, impairment charges are recorded. Pensions Certain assumptions are used in the determination of our annual pension costs and the disclosure of the funded position of our pension plans. Key assumptions include the discount rate used to measure the plans’ projected benefit obligation and the expected rate of return on plan assets. We utilized a discount rate of 5.75 percent in measuring the projected pension benefit obligation at December 31, 2004, 6.25 percent in calculating the net periodic pension cost and an expected return on plan assets of 8.5 percent. A quarter of a percentage point decrease in our discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligation by $1.5 million, and would have a negligible effect on our annual pension expense. An equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a quarter of a percentage point increase in the discount rate. A quarter of a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase the annual pension costs by $0.3 million. 37 Table of Contents Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 132 (revised 2003), “Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106” (“SFAS 132”). This Statement revises employers’ disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by SFAS No. 87, “Employers’ Accounting for Pensions”, SFAS No. 88, “Employers’ Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits” and SFAS No. 106, “Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions”. SFAS 132 requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. We have fully implemented SFAS 132 for the year ended December 31, 2004. In March 2004, the Emerging Issues Task Force (“EITF”) reached a consensus on EITF Issue No. 03-01, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (“EITF 03-01”). EITF 03-01 provides guidance to determine whether an other-than-temporary impairment exists for available-for-sale or held-to-maturity investments under SFAS No. 115, “Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Investments” and investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method. EITF 03-01 also requires certain disclosures related to investments that are in an unrealized loss position at the balance sheet date. The FASB has indefinitely deferred the recognition and measurement guidance in EITF 03-01, through FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. EITF Issue 03-1-1. We have fully implemented all of the required disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2004. In December 2004, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 109-2 (“FSP 109-2”), “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (the “Act”). FSP 109-2 provides enterprises more time (beyond the financial-reporting period during which the Act took effect) to evaluate the Act’s impact on the enterprise’s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes”. We are not intending to repatriate under the Act, therefore FSP 109-2 is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity price risk. We have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies, which have been approved by the board of directors, governing our funding, investments, and use of derivative financial instruments. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures at December 31, 2004 as compared to December 31, 2003. Foreign Exchange Risk We enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements denominated in foreign currencies. We also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar and euro. The terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, forward currency contracts against the U.S. dollar were both purchased (with notional amounts of $41 million and $64 million, respectively) and sold (with notional amounts of $20 million and $60 million, respectively). Based on the year-end 2004 and 2003 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at $2.0 million and $0.4 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 38 Table of Contents At December 31, 2004 and 2003, forward currency contracts against the euro were purchased (with notional amounts of $128 million and $178 million, respectively). Based on the year-end 2004 and 2003 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create a loss valued at $11 million and $16 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions is typically one business day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to the U.S. dollar or one of seventeen other stable transaction currencies. The remaining 143 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure. Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments, which we hold as available-for-sale investments. They are rated AA or above and primarily consist of fixed rate short and medium-term instruments. With respect to fixed maturities, our general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. Based on the net present value of expected future cash flows, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates, assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve, would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of $17 million for each of 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our held-to-maturity investments are not be subject to interest rate movements. Our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of subordinated debt securities. A 100 basis point decrease in rates would result in a fair value loss of $9 million and $12 million for December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures, settlement service operations and other operational needs. These credit facilities have variable rates, which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement. There were no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, under these credit facilities. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Equity Price Risk We own trading securities, which are comprised of equity securities selected to offset obligations in connection with an executive compensation plan. The effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss of $3 million in each of the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. To the extent the executive compensation plan remains in a net appreciation position, an offsetting gain would be recorded in general and administrative expense. 39 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:52:40.384810

1141391,MA,Mastercard Inc,2019,"Item 7.4Table of ContentsOur StrategyWe grow, diversify and build our business through a combination of organic growth and strategic investments. Our ability to grow our business is influenced by personal consumption expenditure (“PCE”) growth, driving cash and check transactions toward electronic forms of payment, increasing our share in electronic payments and providing value-added products and services. In addition, growing our business includes supplementing our core network with enhanced payment capabilities to capture new payment flows, such as business to business (“B2B”), person to person (“P2P”), business to consumer (“B2C”) and government payments, through a combination of product offerings and expanded solutions for our customers. Grow. We focus on growing our core business globally, including growing our consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial products and solutions, as well as increasing the number of payment transactions we switch. We also look to take advantage of the opportunities presented by the evolving ways people interact and transact in the growing digital economy. This includes expanding merchant access to electronic payments through new technologies in an effort to deliver a better consumer experience, while creating greater efficiencies and security.Diversify. We diversify our business by:•working with new customers, including governments, merchants, financial technology companies, digital players, mobile providers and other corporate businesses•scaling our capabilities and business into new geographies, including growing acceptance in markets with limited electronic payments acceptance today•broadening financial inclusion for the unbanked and underbankedBuild. We build our business by:•creating and acquiring differentiated products to provide unique, innovative solutions that we bring to market to support new payment flows, such as real-time account-based payment, Mastercard B2B Hub™ and Mastercard Send™ platforms•providing services across data analytics, consulting, managed services, safety and security, loyalty and processingStrategic Partners. We work with a variety of stakeholders. We provide financial institutions with solutions to help them increase revenue by driving preference for Mastercard-branded products. We help merchants, financial institutions and other organizations by delivering data-driven insights and other services that help them grow and create simple and secure customer experiences. We partner with technology companies such as digital players and mobile providers to deliver digital payment solutions powered by our technology, expertise and security protocols. We help national and local governments drive increased financial inclusion and efficiency, reduce costs, increase transparency to reduce crime and corruption and advance social programs. For consumers, we provide faster, safer and more convenient ways to pay and transfer funds.5Table of ContentsTalent and Culture. Our success is driven by the skills, experience, integrity and mindset of the talent we hire. We attract and retain top talent from diverse backgrounds and industries by building a world-class culture based on decency, respect and inclusion in which people have opportunities to do purpose-driven work that impacts customers, communities and co-workers on a global scale. The diversity and skill sets of our people underpin everything we do.Recent Business and Legal/Regulatory DevelopmentsDigital Payments. Technology is increasingly changing the way people get information, interact with each other, shop and make purchases. As a result of these changes, digital commerce is growing significantly. In this digital environment, consumers continue to seek a seamless experience where their payment is simple, secure and familiar. These consumer demands are driving us to think and act differently. Our teams are innovating to create solutions that meet the needs of our consumers and merchants, and applying emerging technologies to maximize our opportunities from those needs. In 2018, we: •supported the development and implementation of EMVCo’s global standards for a simple and unified digital experience for consumers, issuers and merchants in the form of a common checkout button. This button is designed to provide consumers the same convenience and security in a digital environment that they have when shopping and paying in a store, make it easier for merchants to implement secure digital payments and provide issuers with improved fraud detection and prevention capability.•announced plans to enable token services on all cards, removing the primary account number from the transaction flow. Enabling these services will help make the payment process simpler, more seamless and more secure, while supporting our merchant partners in their card on file activities.•reinforced our support for contactless payments across all markets, including in Europe, where we are working with issuers, acquirers and merchants to ensure availability and support of contactless payments across the continent by 2020. New payment flows. In order to help grow our business and offer more electronic payment options to consumers, businesses and governments, Mastercard has developed and enhanced solutions beyond the principal switching capabilities available on our core network. We believe this will allow us to capture more payment flows, including B2B, P2P, B2C and government disbursements. In 2018, we: •advanced business development efforts around the world with our real-time account-based payments capabilities that we acquired with Vocalink in 2017. These efforts include the launch of a real-time payment service in the U.S. in conjunction with The Clearing House that enables consumers and businesses to send and receive immediate payments. •combined our proprietary Mastercard Send assets with Vocalink strategic partnerships to enable financial institutions, financial technology companies (or fintechs), digital customers and other businesses to send real-time payments to U.K. bank accounts. Mastercard Send will connect to Faster Payments, enabling a variety of use cases such as P2P payments and B2C disbursements. This effort is part of our continued expansion of Mastercard Send’s capabilities, connecting more people, businesses and governments to facilitate the transfer of funds quickly and securely both domestically and cross-border.•expanded the reach of Vocalink’s Pay by Bank application in the United Kingdom, enabling real-time payments directly from a consumer’s bank account using a mobile banking app, with real-time clearing and without the need for a card. •continued to invest in and test proprietary permission-based Blockchain, with an initial focus on the cross-border B2B payments space. 6Table of ContentsSafety and Security. As new technologies and cyber-security threats evolve, including organized cyber-crime and nation state attacks, there is a growing need to protect the security and resilience of the payments ecosystem for every stakeholder. It is critical to protect all transactional and personal data that is stored, processed or transmitted regardless of the device or channel used to make a purchase, while at the same time continuing to improve the payment experience for all stakeholders. We focus on security across networks, and it is embedded in our policies, products, systems and analytics to prevent fraud. In 2018, we:•implemented EMVCo’s 3D Secure 2.0 specification as part of a new solution (launched with issuer and merchant partners globally) that supports app-based authentication, integration with digital wallets and browser-based e-commerce. This is complemented by biometrics, machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions, alongside incremental transaction data, to help merchants seamlessly verify a consumer’s identity. At the same time, the solution reduces friction during the checkout process, as well as reduces fraud while increasing payment approvals.•continued to extend our investments in Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) by:Ø introducing AI Express, a new accelerated technology implementation service to help issuers, acquirers and merchants develop AI models to solve priority problems, including anti-money laundering, fraud, risk management and cybersecurity.Ø scaling Decision Intelligence™, our fraud scoring technology, to score billions of transactions in real time every day while increasing approvals and reducing false declines.•piloted biometric cards in multiple markets, placing fingerprint readers directly onto a card to authenticate a cardholder’s identity (as an alternative to a PIN or signature) using existing chip and contactless acceptance terminals.•modified our rules so that signatures will no longer be required on either cards or receipts and merchants no longer need to capture or compare a signature at the point of sale, helping to provide a faster checkout and more advanced authentication methods. Inclusive Growth. We are dedicated to increasing the opportunity for individuals and micro and small merchants to achieve financial security and greater prosperity, with the benefits of economic growth shared among all segments of society. Together with our partners, we are more than two-thirds of the way toward an important initial step towards that goal by providing access to 500 million people previously excluded from financial services by 2020. We also help communities build the ecosystems that support usage. In 2018, we worked with governments and private sector partners across several geographies to develop and roll out electronic payments solutions, social payment distribution mechanisms and digital identity solutions. We organized a global network of cities to help city leaders address the challenges of urbanization and co-develop solutions to improve life for residents and visitors and promote economic growth. We also deployed our services, partnerships and technologies to develop platforms that help small business owners accept electronic payments, manage their records, access market information, build a financial footprint and use digital communications channels to receive training and business advice. In 2018, we made an initial $100 million contribution to the Mastercard Impact Fund (formerly referred to as Mastercard’s Center for Inclusive Growth Fund), a non-profit charitable organization. This contribution is part of a $500 million commitment to support initiatives that focus on inclusive growth, such as financial inclusion, economic development, the future of work and data science for social impact.7Table of ContentsLegal and Regulatory. We operate in a dynamic and rapidly evolving legal and regulatory environment, with heightened regulatory and legislative scrutiny, expansion of local regulatory schemes and other legal challenges, particularly with respect to interchange fees (as discussed below under “Our Operations and Network”). These challenges create both risks and opportunities for our industry. Our recent legal and regulatory developments include:•Payments RegulationØIn December 2018, we announced the anticipated resolution of an investigation by the European Commission (“EC”) related to the interregional interchange rates we set and our central acquiring rule within the European Economic Area (the “EEA”). With respect to interregional interchange fees, the proposed settlement included changes to those fees that, if accepted by the EC following market testing, would avoid prolonged litigation and gain certainty concerning our business practices. With respect to our historic central acquiring rule, the EC issued a negative decision in January 2019. The EC’s negative decision covers a period of time of less than two years before the rule’s modification in 2015. The decision does not require any modification of our current business practices but includes a fine of €571 million. We recorded a charge of $654 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 in relation to this matter. See Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion.ØSeveral jurisdictions have implemented payments regulation or initiated payments reviews in 2018. In the U.K., the Payment Systems Regulator (the “PSR”) published draft terms of reference for a formal review of card-acquiring services provided by Mastercard, Visa and other card scheme operators that could lead to future regulation. The European Commission expects to issue proposals in 2020 to revise the E.U. Interchange Fee Regulation. In Australia, the Productivity Commission released a report recommending, among other things, that regulators ban interchange fees by the end of 2019 and consider regulating merchant service fees. In Brazil, the Central Bank implemented a weighted average and cap for domestic debit interchange.ØJurisdictions around the globe continue to implement or consider open banking initiatives. Initiatives such as the EEA’s revised Payment Services Directive (commonly referred to as “PSD2”) which went into effect in 2018, require financial institutions to provide third-party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, as well as requiring additional verification information from consumers to complete transactions. Other jurisdictions considering open banking initiatives include Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Japan, Singapore and the United States.ØThe U.K. Treasury has extended the U.K. payment systems oversight to include our Vocalink business due to its role as a payment service provider.•Privacy and Data ProtectionØIn 2018, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (the “GDPR”) became effective. The GDPR is a data protection regulation that has increased our compliance burden for collecting, using and processing personal and sensitive data of EEA residents. We have reviewed our products, services and processes involving EEA personal data to ensure privacy and data protection requirements are embedded into their design. We have also launched online data portals to allow EEA residents to request a copy of their personal data, and to ask for their data to be updated, corrected or deleted as appropriate. In addition, we have taken steps to assist our customers with their compliance efforts. As part of our implementation approach, we co-founded with IBM a data trust called Truata to provide anonymization and analytics services in a GDPR-compliant manner. ØSome jurisdictions are currently considering adopting “data localization” requirements, which mandate the collection, processing, and/or storage of data within their borders, including India, Kenya and Vietnam.•Litigation - In September 2018, we entered into an amended class settlement agreement with the merchant damages class plaintiffs to settle their monetary damages claims in a U.S. antitrust litigation that was brought against Mastercard, Visa and a number of financial institutions. Visa and the financial institutions are also parties to the agreement, which is subject to court approval. In addition to the monetary amounts that constituted the financial settlement under the original agreement, the agreement requires an additional 8Table of Contentspayment from the defendants. We took a charge during 2018 to reflect our share of this payment. Under the agreement, Mastercard and its customer financial institutions will receive a release of all damages claims that were alleged, or could have been alleged by the merchant class members concerning our interchange and fee structure and merchant acceptance rules. This release covers all retrospective claims, as well as prospective claims for a period of five years after the resolution of all appeals relating to court approval of the agreement. In January 2019, the district court issued an order granting preliminary approval of the settlement. The agreement does not relate to the merchants' claims seeking changes to business practices. Separate settlement negotiations for those claims are ongoing. See Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 for further discussion. Our BusinessOur Operations and NetworkWe operate a unique and proprietary global payments network, our core network, that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use a Mastercard product at millions of acceptance locations worldwide. Our core network facilitates an efficient and secure means for receiving payments, a convenient, quick and secure payment method for consumers to access their funds and a channel for businesses to receive insight through information that is derived from our network. We authorize, clear and settle transactions through our core network for our issuer customers in more than 150 currencies and in more than 210 countries and territories. Vocalink expands our range of payment capabilities beyond our core network into real-time account-based payments.Typical Transaction. Our core network supports what is often referred to as a “four-party” payments network. The following diagram depicts a typical transaction on our core network, and our role in that transaction:9Table of ContentsIn a typical transaction, an account holder purchases goods or services from a merchant using one of our payment products. After the transaction is authorized by the issuer, the issuer pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange fee (described below), and then posts the transaction to the account holder’s account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, net of a discount (referred to as the “merchant discount” rate), to the merchant.•Interchange Fees. Interchange fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key role in balancing the costs consumers and merchants incur. We do not earn revenues from interchange fees. Generally, interchange fees are collected from acquirers and paid to issuers to reimburse the issuers for a portion of the costs incurred. These costs are incurred by issuers in providing services that benefit all participants in the system, including acquirers and merchants, whose participation in the network enables increased sales to their existing and new customers, efficiencies in the delivery of existing and new products, guaranteed payments and improved experience for their customers. We (or, alternatively, financial institutions) establish “default interchange fees” that apply when there are no other established settlement terms in place between an issuer and an acquirer. We administer the collection and remittance of interchange fees through the settlement process.•Additional Four-Party System Fees. The merchant discount rate is established by the acquirer to cover its costs of both participating in the four-party system and providing services to merchants. The rate takes into consideration the amount of the interchange fee which the acquirer generally pays to the issuer. Additionally, acquirers may charge merchants processing and related fees in addition to the merchant discount rate, and issuers may also charge account holders fees for the transaction, including, for example, fees for extending revolving credit.Switched Transactions •Authorization, Clearing and Settlement. Through our core network, we enable the routing of a transaction to the issuer for its approval, facilitate the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a successfully conducted transaction, and help to settle the transaction by facilitating the determination and exchange of funds between parties via settlement banks chosen by us and our customers.•Cross-Border and Domestic. Our core network switches transactions throughout the world when the acquirer country and issuer country are different (“cross-border transactions”), providing account holders with the ability to use, and merchants to accept, our products and services across country borders. We also provide switched transaction services to customers where the acquirer country and the issuer country are the same (“domestic transactions”). We switch more than half of all transactions for Mastercard and Maestro-branded cards, including nearly all cross-border transactions. We switch the majority of Mastercard and Maestro-branded domestic transactions in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and a select number of other countries. Outside of these countries, most domestic transactions on our products are switched without our involvement.Core Network Architecture. Our core network features a globally integrated structure that provides scale for our issuers, enabling them to expand into regional and global markets. It is based largely on a distributed (peer-to-peer) architecture with an intelligent edge that enables the network to adapt to the needs of each transaction. Our core network accomplishes this by performing intelligent routing and applying multiple value-added services (such as fraud scoring or rewards at the point of sale) to appropriate transactions in real time. Our core network’s architecture enables us to connect all parties regardless of where or how the transaction is occurring. It has 24-hour a day availability and world-class response time.Real-time Account-based Payment Systems. Augmenting our core network, we now offer real-time account-based payment capabilities through our acquisition of Vocalink, which enables payments between bank accounts in near real-time in countries in which it has been deployed.Payments System Security. Our payment solutions and products are designed to ensure safety and security for the global payments system. The core network and additional platforms incorporate multiple layers of protection, both for continuity purposes and to provide best-in-class security protection. We engage in many efforts to mitigate information security challenges, including maintaining an information security program, a business continuity program and insurance coverage, as well as regularly testing our systems to address potential vulnerabilities.As part of our multi-layered approach to protect the global payments system, we also work with issuers, acquirers, merchants, governments and payments industry associations to help develop and put in place standards (e.g., EMV) for safe and secure transactions.10Table of ContentsDigital Payments. Our networks support and enable our digital payment platforms, products and solutions, reflecting the growing digital economy where consumers are increasingly seeking to use their payment accounts to pay when, where and how they want.Customer Risk. We guarantee the settlement of many of the transactions from issuers to acquirers to ensure the integrity of our core network. We refer to the amount of this guarantee as our settlement exposure. We do not, however, guarantee payments to merchants by their acquirers, or the availability of unspent prepaid account holder account balances. Our Products and Services We provide a wide variety of integrated products and services that support payment products that customers can offer to their account holders. These offerings facilitate transactions on our core network among account holders, merchants, financial institutions, businesses, governments and other organizations in markets globally.Core ProductsConsumer Credit. We offer a number of programs that enable issuers to provide consumers with credit that allow them to defer payment. These programs are designed to meet the needs of our customers around the world and address standard, premium and affluent consumer segments.11Table of ContentsDebit. We support a range of payment products and solutions that allow our customers to provide consumers with convenient access to funds in deposit and other accounts. Our debit and deposit access programs can be used to make purchases and to obtain cash in bank branches, at ATMs and, in some cases, at the point of sale. Our branded debit programs consist of Mastercard (including standard, premium and affluent offerings), Maestro (the only PIN-based solution that operates globally) and Cirrus (our primary global cash access solution).Prepaid. Prepaid programs involve a balance that is funded prior to use and can be accessed via one of our payment products. We offer prepaid payment programs using any of our brands, which we support with processing products and services. Segments on which we focus include government programs such as Social Security payments, unemployment benefits and others; commercial programs such as payroll, health savings accounts, employee benefits and others; and reloadable programs for consumers without formal banking relationships and non-traditional users of electronic payments.We also provide prepaid program management services, primarily outside of the United States, that manage and enable switching and issuer processing for consumer and commercial prepaid travel cards for business partners such as financial institutions, retailers, telecommunications companies, travel agents, foreign exchange bureaus, colleges and universities, airlines and governments.Commercial. We offer commercial payment products and solutions that help large corporations, midsize companies, small businesses and government entities. Our solutions streamline procurement and payment processes, manage information and expenses (such as travel and entertainment) and reduce administrative costs. Our card offerings include travel, small business (debit and credit), purchasing and fleet cards. Our SmartData platform provides expense management and reporting capabilities. Our Mastercard In Control™ platform generates virtual account numbers which provide businesses with enhanced controls, more security and better data. The following chart provides GDV and number of cards featuring our brands in 2018 for select programs and solutions: Year Ended December 31, 2018 As of December 31, 2018 GDV Cards (in billions) Growth (Local) % of Total GDV (in millions) Percentage Increase from December 31, 2017Mastercard Branded Programs1,2 Consumer Credit$2,520 11% 43% 824 8% Consumer Debit and Prepaid2,724 17% 46% 1,126 15% Commercial Credit and Debit657 13% 11% 73 11%1 Excludes Maestro and Cirrus cards and volume generated by those cards.2 Prepaid includes both consumer and commercial prepaid.Additional Platforms. In addition to the switching capabilities of our core network, we offer additional platforms with payment capabilities that extend to new payment flows:•We offer commercial payment products and solutions, such as the Mastercard B2B Hub, which enables small and midsized businesses to optimize their invoice and payment processes. •With Vocalink, we offer real-time account-based payments for ACH transactions. This platform enables payments between bank accounts in real-time and provides enhanced data and messaging capabilities, making them particularly well-suited for B2B and bill payment flows.Value-Added Products and ServicesWe provide additional integrated products and services to our customers and stakeholders, including financial institutions, retailers and governments that enhance the value proposition of our products and solutions.Safety and Security. We offer integrated products and services to prevent, detect and respond to fraud and cyber-attacks and to ensure the safety of transactions made using Mastercard products. We do this using a multi-layered safety and security strategy:•The “Prevent” layer protects infrastructure, devices and data from attacks. We have continued to grow global usage of EMV chip and contactless security technology, helping to reduce fraud. Greater usage of this technology has increased 12Table of Contentsthe number of EMV cards issued and the transaction volume on EMV cards. While this technology is prevalent in Europe, the U.S. market has been adopting this technology in recent years.•The “Identify” layer allows us to help banks and merchants verify genuine consumers during the payment process. Examples of solutions under this layer include Mastercard Identity Check™, a fingerprint, face and iris scanning biometric technology to verify online purchases on mobile devices, and our recently launched Biometric Card which has a fingerprint scanner built in to the card and is compatible with existing EMV payment terminals.•The “Detect” layer spots fraudulent behavior and cyber-attacks and takes action to stop these activities once detected. Examples of our capabilities under this layer include our Early Detection System, Decision Intelligence and Safety Net™ services and technologies.•The “Experience” layer improves the security experience for our stakeholders in areas from the speed of transactions, enhancing approvals for online and card-on-file payments, to the ability to differentiate legitimate consumers from fraudulent ones. Our offerings in this space include Mastercard In Control, for consumer alerts and controls and our suite of digital token services available through our Mastercard Digital Enablement Service (“MDES”).We have also worked with our financial institution customers to provide products to consumers globally with increased confidence through the benefit of “zero liability”, or no responsibility for counterfeit or lost card losses in the event of fraud.Loyalty and Rewards. We have built a scalable rewards platform that enables financial institutions to provide consumers with a variety of benefits and services, such as personalized offers and rewards, access to a global airline lounge network, concierge services, insurance services, emergency card replacement, emergency cash advances and a 24-hour account holder service center. For merchants, we provide campaigns with targeted offers and rewards, management services for publishing offers, and accelerated points programs for co-brand and rewards program members.Processing. We extend our processing capabilities in the payments value chain in various regions and across the globe with an expanded suite of offerings, including:•Issuer solutions designed to provide customers with a complete processing solution to help them create differentiated products and services and allow quick deployment of payments portfolios across banking channels.•Payment gateways that offer a single interface to provide e-commerce merchants with the ability to process secure online and in-app payments and offer value-added solutions, including outsourced electronic payments, fraud prevention and alternative payment options.•Mobile gateways that facilitate transaction routing and processing for mobile-initiated transactions.Analytics Insights and Consulting. We provide proprietary analysis, data-driven consulting and marketing services solutions to help clients optimize, streamline and grow their businesses, as well as deliver value to consumers. Our capabilities incorporate payments expertise and analytical and executional skills to create end-to-end solutions which are increasingly delivered via platforms embedded in our customers’ day-to-day operations. By observing patterns of payments behavior based on billions of transactions switched globally, we leverage anonymized and aggregated information and a consultative approach to help our customers make better business decisions. Our executional skills such as marketing, digital implementation and staff augmentation allow us to assist clients implement actions based on these insights.Increasingly, we have been helping financial institutions, retailers and governments innovate. Drawing on rapid prototyping methodologies from our global innovation and development arm, Mastercard Labs, we offer “Launchpad,” a five day app prototyping workshop. Through our Applied Predictive Technology business, a software as a service platform, we can help our customers conduct disciplined business experiments for in-market tests.Digital EnablementLeveraging our global innovations capability, we work to digitize payment services across all channels and devices:•Delivering better digital experiences everywhere. We are using our technologies and security protocols to develop solutions to make digital shopping and selling experiences, such as on smartphones and other connected devices, simpler, faster and safer for both consumers and merchants. We also offer products that make it easier for merchants to accept payments and expand their customer base and are developing products and practices to facilitate acceptance 13Table of Contentsvia mobile devices. The successful implementation of our loyalty and reward programs is an important part of enabling these digital purchasing experiences.•Securing more transactions. We are leveraging tokenization, biometrics and machine learning technologies in our push to secure every transaction. These efforts include driving EMV-level security and benefits through all our payment channels.•Digitizing personal and business payments. We provide solutions that enable our customers to offer consumers the ability to send and receive money quickly and securely domestically and around the world. These solutions allow our customers to address new payment flows from any funding source, such as cash, card, bank account or mobile money account, to any destination globally, securely and in real time.•Simplifying access to, and integration of, our digital assets. Our Mastercard Developer platform makes it easy for customers and partners to leverage our many digital assets and services. By providing a single access point with tools and capabilities to find what we believe are some of the best-in-class Application Program Interfaces (“APIs”) across a broad range of Mastercard services, we enable easy integration of our services into new and existing solutions.•Identifying and experimenting with future technologies, start-ups and trends. Through Mastercard Labs, our global innovation and development arm, we continue to bring customers and partners access to thought leadership, innovation methodologies, new technologies and relevant early-stage fintech players.BrandOur family of well-known brands includes Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus. We manage and promote our brands through advertising, promotions and sponsorships, as well as digital, mobile and social media initiatives, in order to increase people’s preference for our brands and usage of our products. We sponsor a variety of sporting, entertainment and charity-related marketing properties to align with consumer segments important to us and our customers. Our advertising plays an important role in building brand visibility, usage and overall preference among account holders globally. Our “Priceless®” advertising campaign, which has run in 52 languages in 120 countries worldwide, promotes Mastercard usage benefits and acceptance, markets Mastercard payment products and solutions and provides Mastercard with a consistent, recognizable message that supports our brand around the globe. Revenue Sources We generate revenues primarily from assessing our customers based on GDV on the products that carry our brands, from the fees we charge to our customers for providing transaction processing and from other payment-related products and services. Our net revenues are classified into five categories: domestic assessments, cross-border volume fees, transaction processing, other revenues and rebates and incentives (contra-revenue).See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Revenue” in Part II, Item 7 for more detail about our revenue, GDV, processed transactions and our other payment-related products and services.Intellectual PropertyWe own a number of valuable trademarks that are essential to our business, including Mastercard, Maestro and Cirrus, through one or more affiliates. We also own numerous other trademarks covering various brands, programs and services offered by us to support our payment programs. Trademark and service mark registrations are generally valid indefinitely as long as they are used and/or properly maintained. Through license agreements with our customers, we authorize the use of our trademarks on a royalty-free basis in connection with our customers’ issuing and merchant acquiring businesses. In addition, we own a number of patents and patent applications relating to payment solutions, transaction processing, smart cards, contactless, mobile, biometrics, AI, security systems, blockchain and other matters, many of which are important to our business operations. Patents are of varying duration depending on the jurisdiction and filing date.14Table of ContentsCompetitionWe compete in the global payments industry against all forms of payment including:•cash and checks•card-based payments, including credit, charge, debit, ATM and prepaid products, as well as limited-use products such as private label•contactless, mobile and e-commerce payments, as well as cryptocurrency •other electronic payments, including ACH payments, wire transfers, electronic benefits transfers and bill paymentsWe face a number of competitors both within and outside of the global payments industry:•Cash, Check and Legacy ACH. Cash and checks continue to represent one of the most widely used forms of payment. However, an even larger share of payments on a U.S. dollar volume basis are made via legacy, or “slow,” ACH platforms. •General Purpose Payment Networks. We compete worldwide with payment networks such as Visa, American Express, JCB, China UnionPay and Discover, among others. Some competitors have more market share than we do in certain jurisdictions. Some also have different business models that may provide an advantage in pricing, regulatory compliance burdens or otherwise. In addition, several governments are promoting, or considering promoting, local networks for domestic switching. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for a more detailed discussion of the risks related to payments system regulation and government actions that may prevent us from competing effectively.•Debit and Local Networks. We compete with ATM and point-of-sale debit networks in various countries. In addition, in many countries outside of the United States, local debit brands serve as the main domestic brands, while our brands are used mostly to enable cross-border transactions (typically representing a small portion of overall transaction volume). Certain jurisdictions have also created domestic card schemes focused mostly on debit (e.g., MIR in Russia).•Competition for Customer Business. We compete intensely with other payments companies for customer business. Globally, financial institutions typically issue both Mastercard and Visa-branded payment products, and we compete with Visa for business on the basis of individual portfolios or programs. In addition, a number of our customers issue American Express and/or Discover-branded payment cards in a manner consistent with a four-party system. We continue to face intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our issuers and acquirers, and we seek to enter into business agreements with them through which we offer incentives and other support to issue and promote our payment products. We also compete for merchants, governments and mobile providers.•Real-time Account-based Payment Systems. Through Vocalink, we face competition in the real-time account-based payment space from other companies that provide these payment solutions. In addition, real-time account-based payments face competition from other payment methods, such as cash and checks, cards, electronic, mobile and e-commerce payment platforms, cryptocurrencies and other payments networks.•Alternative Payments Systems and New Entrants. As the global payments industry becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from alternative payment systems and emerging payment providers. Many of these providers have developed payments systems focused on online activity in e-commerce and mobile channels (in some cases, expanding to other channels), and may process payments using in-house account transfers, real-time account-based payment networks or global or local networks. Examples include digital wallet providers (such as Paytm, PayPal, Alipay and Amazon), mobile operator services, mobile phone-based money transfer and microfinancing services (such as mPesa), handset manufacturers and cryptocurrencies. In some circumstances, these providers can be a partner or customer, as well as a competitor. •Value-Added Products and Services. We face competition from companies that provide alternatives to our value-added products and services, including information services and consulting firms that provide consulting services and insights to financial institutions, as well as companies that compete against us as providers of loyalty and program management solutions. In addition, our integrated products and services offerings face competition and potential displacement from transaction processors throughout the world, which are seeking to enhance their networks that link issuers directly with point-of-sale devices for payment transaction authorization and processing services. Regulatory initiatives could also lead to increased competition in this space.15Table of ContentsOur competitive advantages include our:•globally recognized brands•highly adaptable global acceptance network built over 50 years which can reach a variety of parties enabling payments•global payments network with world-class operating performance•expertise in real-time account-based payments through our Vocalink business•adoption of innovative products and digital solutions•safety and security solutions embedded in our networks•analytics insights and consulting services dedicated solely to the payments industry •ability to serve a broad array of participants in global payments due to our expanded on-soil presence in individual markets and a heightened focus on working with governments•world class talentGovernment RegulationGeneral. Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. We are subject to regulations that affect the payments industry in the many countries in which our integrated products and services are used. See “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A for more detail and examples.Payments Oversight. Several central banks or similar regulatory bodies around the world have increased, or are seeking to increase, their formal oversight of the electronic payments industry. Actions by these organizations could influence other organizations around the world to adopt or consider adopting similar oversight. As a result, Mastercard could be subject to new regulation, supervisions and examination requirements. For example, in the U.K., the Bank of England has expanded its oversight of systemically important payment systems to include service providers, as well. Also, in the EEA, the implementation of PSD2 will require financial institutions to provide third party payment processors access to consumer payment accounts, which may enable these processors to route transactions away from Mastercard products by offering certain services directly to people who currently use our products. PSD2 will also require a new standard for authentication of transactions, which necessitates additional verification information from consumers to complete transactions. This may increase the number of transactions that consumers abandon if we are unable to ensure a frictionless authentication experience under the new standards.Interchange Fees. Interchange fees associated with four-party payments systems like ours are being reviewed or challenged in various jurisdictions around the world via legislation to regulate interchange fees, competition-related regulatory proceedings, central bank regulation and litigation. Examples include statutes in the United States that cap debit interchange for certain regulated activities and European Union legislation capping consumer credit and debit interchange fees on payments issued and acquired within the EEA. For more detail, see our risk factors in “Risk Factors-Regulations Related to Our Participation in the Payments Industry” in Part I, Item 1A.

1141391,MA,Mastercard Inc,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard International”) and MasterCard Europe sprl (“MasterCard Europe”) (together, “MasterCard” or the “Company”) included elsewhere in this Report. Overview We are a global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of our customers’ credit, debit and related payment programs. We manage a family of well-known, widely accepted payment card brands including MasterCard®, MasterCard Electronic™, Maestro® and Cirrus®, which we license to our financial institution customers. As part of managing these brands, we also provide our customers with information and transaction processing services and establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card system by customers and merchants. We generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing these transaction processing and other payment-related services (operations fees) and by charging assessments to our customers based on the gross dollar volume (GDV) of activity on the cards that carry our brands (assessments). Our pricing for transactions and services is complex. Each category of revenue has numerous fee components depending on the types of transactions or services provided. In addition, standard pricing varies among our regional businesses, and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements. Operations fees are typically transaction-based and include authorization, settlement and switch, connectivity, currency conversion, warning bulletins, and other fees for a variety of additional services. Assessments are based on GDV for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the nature of the transactions that generate GDV. GDV includes the aggregated dollar amount of usage (purchases, cash disbursements, balance transfers and convenience checks) on MasterCard-branded cards. Our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. Our operating expenses are comprised primarily of general and administrative expenses such as personnel, professional fees, data processing, telecommunications, travel and advertising and marketing expenses to promote our brands, including promotions and sponsorships. We evaluate and monitor our business based on our results from operations, including our percentage of revenue growth and operating expenses as a percentage of total revenue, and our financial position. In addition, we utilize growth in GDV and processed transactions to monitor the strength of our business. Our liquidity and capital position are strong. We had $1.3 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities, and $1.2 billion in stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2005. We achieved double-digit revenue growth of 13% in 2005. The increase in revenues was due to higher gross usage on cards carrying our brands for goods and services, a larger number of transactions processed by MasterCard, higher cross-border travel by cardholders using our cards and certain pricing changes that went into effect on April 1, 2005. The pricing changes including implementing new fees, increasing existing fees or 41 Table of Contents modifying our fee calculation methodology accounted for approximately 5% of net revenue growth in 2005. Significant changes in the methodology for calculating fees primarily related to a component of settlement fees being changed from tiered pricing to a flat rate, a component of authorization fees being changed from monthly pricing to weekly pricing which increased utilization, and connectivity fees being expanded to include a charge for the volume of information being transmitted in addition to the fixed fee initially charged. Operating expenses, excluding the impact of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, increased 11% in 2005. We continued to reduce our operating expenses, excluding the impact of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, as a percentage of total revenues to 84% in 2005 from 86% in 2004. In June 2002, we acquired Europay International S.A. (now MasterCard Europe). In 2004, we acquired a research firm and a consulting firm, both of which were immaterial to our operations. The results of operations for these acquisitions are included from their respective acquisition dates. We successfully complied with Sarbanes-Oxley Section 404 testing three years ahead of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s deadline for non-accelerated filers. We concluded, based on our assessment, that our internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2005. We believe the trend within the global payments industry from paper-based forms of payment such as cash and checks toward electronic forms of payment such as cards creates significant opportunities for the continued growth of our business. Our strategy is to drive growth by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and higher-growth segments of the global payments industry (such as corporate payments, prepaid cards and chip based cards), enhancing our merchant relationships, maintaining unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands. We intend to expand our role in targeted geographies by, among other things, pursuing incremental payment processing opportunities in the European Union in connection with the implementation of the Single European Payment Area initiative and in Latin America and Asia/Pacific countries. We are committed to providing our key customers with coordinated services through integrated, dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to leverage our expertise in payment programs, brand marketing, product development, technology, processing and consulting services for these customers. By investing in strong customer relationships over the long-term, we believe that we can increase our volume of business with key customers over time, and in support of this strategy, we are hiring additional resources and developing sales and other personnel. There is increased regulatory scrutiny of interchange fees and other aspects of the payments industry which could have an adverse impact on our business. In addition, we face exposure to antitrust and other types of litigation. Competition and pricing pressure within the global payments industry is increasing, due in part to consolidation within the banking sector and the growing power of merchants. Regulatory actions, litigation, and pricing pressure may lead us to change our pricing arrangements and could reduce our overall revenues. See Item 1A—Risk Factors of this Report for these and other risks facing our business. We are party to a number of currency conversion litigations as discussed in Note 18 to our Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Based upon litigation developments and settlement negotiations in these cases and pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”, MasterCard recorded an additional $75 million of legal reserves in 2005. As a result of these additional reserves, we have now established total legal reserves of $89 million in connection with these currency conversion cases. This estimate may be revised based on future developments in these cases. Proposed New Ownership and Governance Structure We are pursuing a plan for new ownership and governance structure that will include the appointment of a new board of directors comprised of a majority of directors that will be independent of MasterCard and our members, the establishment of a charitable foundation and the transition to being a publicly traded company. 42 Table of Contents Under the proposed ownership and governance structure, MasterCard’s current stockholders are expected to retain a 44% equity interest (or 41% of our equity if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full) in the company through ownership of new non-voting class B common stock. In addition, existing stockholders are expected to receive a new class M common stock that will have no economic rights but will provide them with certain rights, including the right to approve specified significant corporate actions and entitle them to elect up to three of MasterCard’s directors (but not more than one quarter of all directors) but are otherwise non-voting. MasterCard also intends to issue shares of a new voting class A common stock to public investors through an initial public offering. Upon successful completion of the offering, these public investors will hold shares representing an expected 46% of the Company’s equity and 82% of its general voting power (or 49% of our equity and 83% of our general voting power if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). Additional shares of class A common stock, representing approximately 10% of the Company’s equity and 18% of its voting rights (or 17% of our general voting power if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full), are expected to be issued as a donation to The MasterCard Foundation, a charitable foundation incorporated in Canada (the “Foundation”). This donation will have a dilutive effect on each existing stockholders’ equity interest in the Company. The Foundation will build on MasterCard’s existing charitable giving commitments by continuing to support programs and initiatives that help children and youth to access education, understand and utilize technology and develop the skills necessary to succeed in a diverse and global work force. In addition, the Foundation will work in conjunction with organizations that provide microfinance programs and services to financially disadvantaged persons and communities in order to enhance local economies and develop entrepreneurs. We are in the process of identifying directors of the Foundation that will be required to be independent of us and our members. In connection with this donation we expect to record an expense that is equal to the aggregate value of the Class A common stock we are donating at the time of the offering together with approximately $40 million in cash to be donated to the Foundation over a period of up to four years in support of its operating expenses and charitable disbursements for the first four years of its operations, and we may make additional cash contributions to the Foundation after this period. Because the Foundation’s operations are currently being established, the overall size and timing of our expected initial cash donation have not been finally determined. The value of the shares of Class A common stock we donate will be determined based on the initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock in the initial public offering less a marketability discount. This marketability discount and the methodology used to quantify it will be determined by management in consultation with independent valuation consultants to be retained by MasterCard. As a result of this expense, we expect to record a significant net loss for the quarter in which the offering is completed and may record a net loss for the 2006 fiscal year. We also expect to record expense equal to the value of any cash we donate in the period or periods in which such donation or donations are made. These donations will generally not be deductible to MasterCard for tax purposes. Accordingly, as a result of the difference between financial statement and tax treatments of the donations, we expect there to be a significant increase to our effective tax rate in the periods in which the contributions are made. We intend to use all but $650 million of our net proceeds from the initial public offering (including any proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) to redeem a number of shares of Class B common stock from our existing stockholders that is equal to the aggregate number of shares of Class A common stock that we issue to investors in the initial public offering (including any shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) and to the Foundation. As a result, our existing stockholders will own 41% of the Company’s equity. We intend to use the remaining proceeds to increase our capital, defend ourselves against legal and regulatory challenges, expand our role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments industry and for other general corporate purposes. However, we have not determined the amounts of such remaining proceeds that are to be allocated to these purposes. Implementation of the new ownership and governance structure is subject to various approvals, including requisite regulatory filings. Our stockholders approved the new ownership and governance structure at a special meeting on November 28, 2005. 43 Table of Contents In addition, in connection with our new ownership and governance structure we intend to implement equity based compensation plans. The implementation date of these plans has not been determined as the underlying transactions have not been completed. We expect to convert our existing long term incentive cash award plans into an equity based compensation plan. Based on the proposal for this conversion, we may recognize $11 million additional personnel expense in future periods based on vesting within the plans. Our Compensation Committee has also granted 2006 awards under the equity based long term incentive plan. We also intend to grant a one time restricted stock unit award to non-executive management employees which will result in deferred stock-based compensation equal to the fair value of the restricted stock units on the grant date, which will be amortized over the three-year vesting period. Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our operations are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Assessment fees are calculated based on local currency volume, which is converted to U.S. dollar volume using average exchange rates for the quarter. As a result, assessment revenues increased in each period due to the devaluation of the U.S. dollar. In 2005 and 2004, a 13% and 15% increase in GDV on a U.S. dollar converted basis, respectively, exceeded local currency GDV growth of 12% and 11%, respectively, compared to the same periods in the prior year. We are especially impacted by the movements of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar since the functional currency of MasterCard Europe, our principal European operating subsidiary, is the euro. The devaluation of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the impact of the translation of MasterCard Europe’s operating results into U.S. dollar amounts are summarized as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Euro to U.S. dollar average exchange rate $ 1.2455 $ 1.2383 $ 1.1277 Devaluation of U.S. dollar to euro (1 )% (10 )% (14 )% Revenue growth attributable to translation of MasterCard Europe revenues to U.S. dollars — 2 % 2 % Operating expense growth attributable to translation of MasterCard Europe expenses to U.S. dollars — 2 % 1 % Revenues We earned approximately 66%, 63% and 64% of our net revenues from net operations fees and approximately 34%, 37% and 36% of our net revenues from net assessments in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operations fees are user fees for facilitating the processing of payment transactions and information management among our customers. MasterCard’s system for transaction processing involves four participants in addition to us: issuers (the cardholders’ banks), acquirers (the merchants’ banks), merchants and cardholders. Operations fees are charged to issuers, acquirers or their delegated processors for transaction processing services, specific programs to promote MasterCard-branded card acceptance and additional services to assist our customers in managing their businesses. The significant components of operation fees are as follows: • Authorization occurs when a merchant requests approval for a cardholder’s transaction. We charge a fee for routing the authorization for approval to or from the issuer or in certain circumstances, such as when the issuer’s systems are unavailable, for approval by us or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuer’s instructions. Our rules, which vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. • Settlement refers to the process in which we determine the amounts due between issuers and acquirers for payment transactions and associated fees. Once quantified we transfer the financial transaction details and relevant funds among issuers, acquirers or their designated third-party processors. We charge a fee for these settlement services. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. 44 Table of Contents • Switch fees are fees for the use of the MasterCard Debit Switch (“MDS”), our debit processing system. The MDS transmits financial messages between acquirers and issuers and provides transaction and statistical reporting and performs settlement between members and other debit transaction processing networks. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. • Currency conversion fees are volume-based fees charged to issuers for foreign currency conversion. We process transactions denominated in more than 160 currencies. As a result of our global system, cardholders have the ability to pay for transactions in the local currency of a merchant and for the charge to appear on the cardholders’ statement in their own home currency. Accordingly, currency conversion is required for cross-border transactions to complete the settlement between issuers and acquirers. • Acceptance development fees are charged to issuers based on GDV and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale. These fees are primarily U.S. based. • Warning bulletin fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants. • Connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment, and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. The methodology for calculating the transmission fees was changed on April 1, 2005 so that they are based on the volume of information being transmitted through our systems and the number of connections to our systems. Prior to April 1, 2005, these transmission fees were calculated solely based on the number of connections. • Consulting and research fees as well as outsourcing services fees are primarily generated by MasterCard Advisors, our professional advisory services group. We provide a wide range of consulting, information and outsourcing services associated with our customers’ payment activities and programs. Research includes revenues from subscription-based services, access to research inquiry, and peer networking services generated by our independent financial and payments industry research group. We do not anticipate research becoming a significant percentage of our business. MasterCard Advisors’ revenues, of which consulting and research fees are components, are less than 10% of our consolidated revenues. • Other operations fees are primarily user-pay services including the sale of manuals, publications, holograms, information and reports, as well as compliance programs, to assist our customers in managing their businesses. In addition, other operations fees include fees for cardholder services in connection with the benefits provided with MasterCard-branded cards, such as insurance, telecommunications assistance for lost cards or locating automated teller machines. Generally we process all MasterCard-branded domestic transactions in the U.S. and in a few international markets. We process substantially all cross-border MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus transactions. We charge relatively higher operations fee rates for settlement, authorization and switch fees on cross-border transactions and earn currency conversion fees if the transactions require conversion between two different currencies. Offline debit transactions are generally signature-based debit transactions and are processed and priced similar to credit transactions. Operation fees for processing online debit transactions (Maestro and Cirrus transactions) are priced in a similar manner as offline debit and credit transactions. Assessments are calculated based on our customers’ GDV. Assessment rates vary by region. Most of our assessment rates are tiered and rates decrease when customers meet incremental volume hurdles. These rates also vary by the type of transaction. We generally assess at higher rates for cross-border volumes compared to domestic volumes. We also assess at higher rates for retail purchases versus cash withdrawals. Credit and offline transactions are assessed at higher rates than online debit transactions. In addition, from time to time the Company may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs. These assessments are often introduced at the request of customers in a particular region or country. Assessments that are based on quarterly GDV are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance. 45 Table of Contents In 2005 and 2004, gross revenue grew 21% and 16%, respectively. A component of our revenue growth for the year ended December 31, 2005 was the result of implementing new fees and changes to existing fees charged to our customers on April 1, 2005. However, this growth is being moderated by the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives. Accordingly, we have entered into business agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide GDV and other performance-based support incentives. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were approximately 22%, 16% and 17% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. These pricing arrangements reflect enhanced competition in the global payments industry and the continued consolidation and globalization of our key customers and merchants. The rebates and incentives are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period that performance occurs. We establish standards and procedures for the acceptance and settlement of our customer’s transactions on a global basis. Our customers may choose to engage third parties for transaction processing and are responsible to ensure that these third parties comply with our standards. Cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers. Accordingly, we do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands. The United States remains our largest geographic market based on revenues. However, international revenues grew at a faster rate than U.S. revenues in 2005 and 2004. In 2005, the international revenue growth was not specifically related to one region in which we do business. However, in 2004, the growth was primarily in the European region due to new assessment revenue streams and increased transactions. Accordingly, revenue generated in the United States was approximately 55%, 58% and 63% of total revenues in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of total revenues in any period. Our business is dependent on certain world economies and consumer behaviors. In the past, our revenues have been impacted by specific events such as the war in Iraq, the SARS outbreak and the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack. Consumer behavior can be impacted by a number of factors, including confidence in the MasterCard brand. 46 Table of Contents Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 For the Years Ended December 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 (In millions, except per share, percent and GDV amounts) Operations fees $ 1,941 $ 1,637 $ 1,431 18.6 % 14.4 % Assessments 997 956 800 4.3 % 19.5 % Net revenue 2,938 2,593 2,231 13.3 % 16.2 % General and administrative 1,352 1,186 1,099 14.0 % 7.9 % Advertising and market development 1,008 916 851 10.0 % 7.6 % U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements 75 22 763 240.9 % (97.1 )% Depreciation and amortization 110 122 120 (9.8 )% 1.7 % Total operating expenses 2,545 2,246 2,833 13.3 % (20.7 )% Operating income (loss) 393 347 (602 ) 13.3 % 157.6 % Total other income (expense) 14 (23 ) (10 ) 160.9 % (130.0 )% Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) and cumulative effect of accounting change 407 324 (612 ) 25.6 % 152.9 % Income tax expense (benefit) 140 86 (221 ) 62.8 % 138.9 % Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax — — 5 — (100.0 )% Net income (loss) $ 267 $ 238 $ (386 ) 12.2 % 161.7 % Net income (loss) per share (basic and diluted)1 $ 2.67 $ 2.38 $ (3.86 ) 12.2 % 161.7 % Pro forma net income (loss) per share (basic and diluted)2 $ 1.98 $ 1.76 $ (2.86 ) 12.5 % 161.5 % Weighted average shares outstanding (basic and diluted)1 100 100 100 — — Pro forma weighted average shares outstanding (basic and diluted)2 135 135 135 — — Effective income tax (benefit) rate 34.5 % 26.5 % (36.1 )% * * * * Gross dollar volume (“GDV”) on a US dollar converted basis (in billions) 1,660.6 1,466.8 1,281.4 13.2 % 14.5 % Processed transactions3 13,993.3 12,324.5 10,056.3 13.5 % 22.6 % ** Not meaningful 1 As more fully described in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, in connection with the ownership and governance transactions we will reclassify all of our 100 outstanding shares of existing Class A redeemable common stock so that our existing stockholders will receive 1.35 shares of our Class B common stock for each share of Class A redeemable common stock that they held prior to the reclassification and a single share of our Class M common stock. Accordingly, shares and per share data will be retroactively restated in the financial statements subsequent to the reclassification to reflect the reclassification as if it were effective at the start of the first period being presented in the financial statements. 2 Pro forma amounts give effect to the reclassification described above as if it were in place for the periods presented. 3 The data for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 has been restated to conform with the methodology utilized in calculating processed transactions in 2005. Prior to 2005, processed transactions reported by MasterCard included certain MasterCard-branded (excludes Maestro and Cirrus) transactions for which we received transaction details from our customers but which were not processed by our systems. Our management determined in 2005 that it would be more appropriate to exclude such transactions from the processed transactions calculation. The processed transactions for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 have been restated to be consistent with the calculation of processed transactions in 2005. Revenue has not been impacted by this change. 47 Table of Contents Operations Fees The significant components in operations fees are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Dollar Increase (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2005 2004 (In millions, except percent) Authorization, settlement and switch $ 1,055 $ 913 $ 785 $ 142 $ 128 15.6 % 16.3 % Currency conversion 317 281 234 36 47 12.8 % 20.1 % Acceptance development fees 171 85 84 86 1 101.2 % 1.2 % Warning bulletin fees 70 66 70 4 (4 ) 6.1 % (5.7 )% Connectivity 63 35 34 28 1 80.0 % 2.9 % Consulting and research fees 63 38 12 25 26 65.8 % 216.7 % Other operations fees 378 337 304 41 33 12.2 % 10.9 % Gross operations fees 2,117 1,755 1,523 362 232 20.6 % 15.2 % Rebates (176 ) (118 ) (92 ) (58 ) (26 ) 49.2 % 28.3 % Net operations fees $ 1,941 $ 1,637 $ 1,431 $ 304 $ 206 18.6 % 14.4 % • Authorization, settlement and switch revenues increased due to the number of transactions processed through our systems increasing 14% and 23% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2005, a portion of the revenue increase was due to the pricing of a component of these revenues being restructured on April 1, 2005. In the third quarter 2003, MasterCard began processing transactions related to the Switch brand, a domestic U.K. debit brand, which significantly impacted processed transactions growth and accordingly contributed to the increase in revenues. Excluding Switch transactions, processed transaction growth would have been 13% in 2004. The volatility of exchange rates contributed to decreased settlement trading revenue of $2 million in 2005 and increased settlement trading revenue of $16 million and $33 million in 2004 and 2003, respectively. • Currency conversion revenues fluctuate with the level of cross-border transactions and our customers’ need for transactions to be converted into their base currency. While the conflict in Iraq, threat of terrorism and outbreak of SARS negatively impacted cross-border travel in the beginning of 2003, cross-border travel increased significantly in the latter part of 2003, and continued to grow in 2004 and in 2005. • Connectivity revenues in 2005 increased primarily due to a change in the connectivity fee structure on April 1, 2005. • Acceptance development fees increased in 2005 primarily due to the implementation of new fees and increases on the pricing of existing fees which occurred on April 1, 2005. • Consulting and research fees increased primarily due to new engagements with our customers in 2005 and 2004 and the acquisition of a research firm in the first quarter of 2004. • Warning bulletin fees fluctuate with our customer requests for distribution of invalid account information. • Other operations fees represent various revenue streams including cardholder services, compliance, holograms, and manuals and publications. The change in any individual revenue line was not material. • Rebates relating to operations fees are primarily based on transactions and volumes and, accordingly, increase as these variables increase. Rebates have been increasing due to agreements with new customers, renewals of existing agreements, ongoing consolidation of our customers and competition. Rebates as a percentage of gross operations fees were 8%, 7%, and 6% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 48 Table of Contents Assessments Assessments are revenues that are calculated based on our customers’ GDV. The components of assessments are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, Dollar Increase (Decrease) Percent Increase (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 (In millions, except percent) Gross assessments $ 1,631 $ 1,341 $ 1,156 $ 290 $ 185 21.6 % 16.0 % Rebates and incentives (634 ) (385 ) (356 ) (249 ) (29 ) 64.7 % 8.1 % Net assessments $ 997 $ 956 $ 800 $ 41 $ 156 4.3 % 19.5 % GDV growth was 12% and 11% in 2005 and 2004, respectively, when measured in local currency terms, and 13% and 15%, respectively, when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. In addition to the increase in GDV, assessments grew due to the following factors: • Assessments for marketing programs and other specific purposes increased in 2005, 2004, and 2003. We introduced new or increased assessments for market development programs in specific countries or regions within Europe and Latin America. In 2005, offsetting a portion of the increase in assessments was the elimination of an assessment for the promotion of soccer in the European region, which became a component of the core assessment rates in 2005. • Assessment rates vary based on the nature of the transactions that generate the GDV. In 2005 and 2004, there was stronger growth in international volumes and purchase volumes, which are generally assessed at higher rates than domestic volumes and cash volumes, respectively. • Acquirer volumes were greater in 2005 and are generally assessed at higher rates than issuer volumes, accordingly acquirer assessments increased during 2005. In addition, new acquirer assessments were implemented in Canada. Rebates and incentives provided to customers and merchants relating to assessments reduce revenue, moderate assessments growth and are generally based on GDV, as well as a fixed component for the issuance of new cards or the launch of new programs. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 39%, 29% and 31% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in the percentage of rebates and incentives compared to gross assessments was the result of new or revised pricing arrangements with certain large customers and merchants in 2005 and 2004. We expect our agreements with our customers and merchants to continue to moderate net revenue growth in 2006 and subsequent years. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and market development, U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and depreciation and amortization expenses. We reduced our operating expenses, excluding the impact of the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, as a percentage of total revenues to 84% in 2005 from 86% in 2004 and 93% in 2003. Operating expenses increased $299 million or 13% in 2005 compared to a decrease of $587 million or 21% in 2004. Excluding the charges to earnings related to the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements, there would have been an increase in operating expenses of $246 million, or 11%, in 2005 and $154 million, or 7%, in 2004. Operating expenses increased in 2004 by $31 million in connection with the acquisition of a research firm and a consulting firm. 49 Table of Contents General and Administrative General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel, professional fees, data processing, telecommunications and travel. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, these activities accounted for approximately 46%, 46% and 49% of total revenues, respectively. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increases in personnel expenses. The major components of general and administrative expenses were as follows: For the years ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 2005 2004 (In millions, except percent) Personnel $ 890 $ 741 $ 689 $ 149 $ 52 20.1 % 7.5 % Professional fees 135 130 100 5 30 3.8 % 30.0 % Telecommunications 71 74 87 (3 ) (13 ) (4.1 )% (14.9 )% Data processing 62 59 54 3 5 5.1 % 9.3 % Travel 84 66 61 18 5 27.3 % 8.2 % Other 110 116 108 (6 ) 8 (5.2 )% 7.4 % General and administrative expenses $ 1,352 $ 1,186 $ 1,099 $ 166 $ 87 14.0 % 7.9 % • Personnel expense increased for the following reasons: - We hired additional staff to support our strategic initiatives. As we continue to expand our customer-focused approach and expand our relationships with merchants, additional personnel are required. - We changed our methodology of recognizing the cost of executive incentive cash award plans in 2005, as more fully described in Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, which resulted in a catch-up adjustment of $19 million in 2005. - We updated the assumptions for our severance plan accrual which resulted in higher severance costs of $20 million in 2005 compared to 2004. This increase was offset by an $8 million reduction in the expense for actual severed employees in 2005. - We awarded higher performance awards and merit increases in 2005 and 2004, which resulted from better than anticipated performance against company objectives. - We acquired two consulting firms in 2004. • Professional fees increased in 2005 and 2004 primarily due to legal fees and consulting services used to develop and implement our strategic initiatives. Consulting services and audit fees increased in 2005 and 2004 relating to compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. • Telecommunications expense decreased in 2005 and 2004 as a result of our ongoing evaluation of telecommunication needs, including renegotiation of certain contracts with service providers. • Data processing consists of expenses to operate and maintain MasterCard’s computer systems. These expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage. • Travel expenses are incurred primarily for travel to customer and regional meetings and accordingly have increased with the corresponding increase in our business activity. • Other includes rental expense for our facilities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous administrative expenses. Advertising and Market Development Advertising and market development consists of expenses associated with advertising, marketing, promotions and sponsorships, which promote our brands and assist our customers in achieving their goals by raising consumer awareness and usage of cards carrying our brands. In 2005, 2004 and 2003 these activities accounted for approximately 34%, 35% and 38% of total revenues, respectively. Advertising and market development expenses increased $92 million, or 10%, in 2005 and $65 million, or 8%, in 2004. 50 Table of Contents Our brands, principally MasterCard, are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets. Our approach to marketing activities combines advertising, sponsorships, promotions, interactive media and public relations as part of an integrated package designed to increase MasterCard brand awareness and preference and usage of MasterCard cards. We are committed to maintaining and enhancing our brands and image through advertising and marketing efforts on a global scale. Merchant Lawsuit and Other Legal Settlements In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $721 million ($469 million after-tax) consisting of (i) the monetary amount of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement (discounted at 8 percent over the payment term), (ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in order to comply with, other requirements of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement, and (iii) costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. The $721 million pre-tax charge amount was an estimate, which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court, and other factors. We are party to a number of currency conversion litigations which are more fully described in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. Based upon litigation developments and settlement negotiations in these currency conversion cases and pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”, we recorded a $14 million reserve in 2004 and an additional $75 million reserve in 2005. This estimate may need to be revised based on future developments. Total liabilities for the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements changed as follows (in millions): Balance as of December 31, 2003 $ 672 Currency conversion court award of plaintiff attorney’s fees 14 Other legal settlements and revisions of U.S. merchant lawsuit opt-out estimate 10 Interest accretion 51 Payments (149 ) Balance as of December 31, 2004 598 Legal settlement accrual for currency conversion litigations 75 Interest accretion 47 Payments (115 ) Balance as of December 31, 2005 $ 605 Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses decreased $12 million in 2005 and increased $2 million in 2004. The decrease is primarily related to the maturity of certain capital leases and certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Our business is dependent on the technology that we use to process transactions. This technology is continuously updated and improved. During 2004, we completed a five year upgrade of all of MasterCard’s core systems to improve productivity and lower overall processing costs. In addition, in 2003, our co-processing technology center was moved from Lake Success, New York to Kansas City, Missouri. Our Lake Success co-processing facility would have required a significant investment to rehabilitate its aging infrastructure and improve security. Kansas City, Missouri was selected as the new location for the co-processing facility due to its relative proximity to our other processing facility in St. Louis, Missouri. The cost of the new facility and equipment was $36 million. 51 Table of Contents Other Income and Expense Other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense and other gains and losses. Investment income increased $12 million in 2005 and decreased $8 million in 2004. The increase in 2005 is primarily due to an increase in interest income from higher cash balances and interest rates. The decrease in 2004 resulted from a decline in the market value of our trading securities portfolio. Interest expense was the same in 2005 and 2004 and increased $7 million in 2004 from 2003 primarily due to interest expense related to imputed interest on the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement. In 2005, we recognized $17 million in other gains relating to a settlement of a dispute of a customer business agreement and $9 million in gains relating the sale of two affiliated investments. Income Taxes The effective income tax expense (benefit) rate for years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was 34.5%, 26.5% and (36.1)%, respectively. The rate in 2005 was higher than 2004 primarily attributable to the settlement and reassessment, during 2004, of various tax audit issues discussed below. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2004 as compared to 2003 is attributable to the reassessment, during 2004, of tax issues under examination in the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for the years 1998 through 2000 and issues under examination in Japan for the years 2000 through 2003. In the course of the IRS audit, affirmative refund claims were filed and the related tax benefits were recognized. In addition, MasterCard favorably settled a foreign tax audit in India for the years 1996 through 2001. The 2003 tax benefit was primarily driven by the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement. The amount of the litigation settlement and its impact on pretax income was such that the permanent differences for 2003, which are shown in the table below, did not significantly affect the tax rate, resulting in a tax benefit at the highest marginal tax rate. The components impacting the effective tax rate are: For the Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Dollar Amount Percent Dollar Amount Percent Dollar Amount Percent (In millions, except percent) Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) and cumulative effect of accounting change $ 407 $ 324 $ (612 ) Federal statutory tax (benefit) $ 143 35.0 % $ 113 35.0 % $ (214 ) (35.0 )% State tax effect, net of Federal benefit 4 0.9 % 4 1.3 % 2 0.3 % Foreign tax effect, net of Federal benefit 5 1.1 % 4 1.2 % (4 ) (0.6 )% Non-deductible expenses and other differences (2 ) (0.3 )% 4 1.0 % 2 0.3 % Tax exempt income (8 ) (2.0 )% (7 ) (2.1 )% (7 ) (1.1 )% Adjustment to deferred tax for change in tax rate: United States—state — — (8 ) (2.6 )% — — Foreign — — — — — — Refund claims and settlement of audit matters: United States 1 0.3 % (11 ) (3.4 )% — — Foreign (2 ) (0.5 )% (13 ) (3.9 )% — — Income tax expense (benefit) $ 141 34.5 % $ 86 26.5 % $ (221 ) (36.1 )% Liquidity We need capital resources and liquidity to fund our global development, to provide for credit and settlement risk, to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions and to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt and the settlement of the U.S. merchant lawsuit. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities with which to manage operations. We expect that the cash generated from operations and our 52 Table of Contents borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet our operating, working capital and capital needs in 2006. However, our liquidity could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are a party. See Item 1A—“Risk Factors—Legal and Regulatory Risks” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2005 2004 2003 2005 vs. 2004 2004 vs. 2003 (In millions, except percent) Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 273 $ 344 $ 190 (20.6 )% 81.1 % Net cash used in investing activities (34 ) (275 ) (170 ) 87.6 % (61.8 )% Balance Sheet Data: Current assets $ 2,228 $ 1,903 $ 1,610 17.1 % 18.2 % Current liabilities 1,557 1,301 1,189 19.7 % 9.4 % Long-term liabilities 970 984 1,009 (1.4 )% (2.5 )% Equity 1,169 975 699 19.9 % 39.5 % For the year ended December 31, 2005, our operations provided $273 million of cash, compared to $344 million in 2004. In 2005 and 2004, we made $115 million and $149 million, respectively, in payments related to the U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements and $40 million and $15 million, respectively, of voluntary contributions to our qualified pension plan. The decrease in cash from operations in 2005 from 2004 period was due to higher income tax payments and prepayments made in accordance with new customer incentive agreements. Maintaining our customer relationships pursuant to these incentive agreements has required MasterCard to provide more as well as higher prepayments of rebates and incentives than in previous periods. These cash outflows are offset by stronger operating performance and an increase in accruals for personnel costs associated with the Company’s employee incentive and severance plans. The increase in cash from operations in 2004 from 2003 was primarily due to stronger operating performance in 2004 compared to 2003. The utilization of cash for investing activities in 2005 and 2004 was primarily due to purchases exceeding sales of available-for-sale securities and the acquisition of certain businesses. In 2005 and 2004, we also invested in the internal development of capitalized software and purchase of fixed assets to support our business. Our capitalized software is essential to providing payment card transaction processing to our customers through our proprietary global computer and telecommunications system. Our investing activities in 2003 included $36 million for a co-processing facility in Kansas City, Missouri, and associated equipment. Under the terms of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement agreement, the Company is required to pay $100 million annually each December through the year 2012. Additionally, in accordance with the Company’s employee incentive plans, certain payouts to participants are made in the first quarter of each year. In addition to our liquid investments, on June 17, 2005, we entered into a committed unsecured $2.25 billion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) with Citigroup Global Markets Inc., as sole lead arranger, Citibank, N.A. and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as co-administrative agents, J.P. Morgan Securities, Inc., as co-arranger, HSBC Bank (USA), N.A., Lloyds TSB Bank, plc and Royal Bank of Scotland, as co-syndication agents, and certain other lenders. The Credit Facility, which expires on June 16, 2006, replaced our prior $1.95 billion credit facility which expired on June 17, 2005. Borrowings under the facility are available to provide liquidity in the event of one or more settlement failures by MasterCard International members and, subject to a limit of $300 million, for general corporate purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility is charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 28 basis points or an alternative base rate. An additional 10 basis points would be applied if the aggregate borrowings under the Credit Facility exceed 33% of the commitments. MasterCard agreed to pay a facility fee which varies based on MasterCard’s credit rating and is currently equal to 7 basis points on the total commitment, or approximately $1.6 million annually. MasterCard 53 Table of Contents was in compliance with the Credit Facility covenants as of December 31, 2005. There were no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2005. The majority of Credit Facility lenders are members or affiliates of members of MasterCard International. Due to Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services’ (S&P) assessment of MasterCard’s vulnerability to legal risk, on May 16, 2003, S&P lowered MasterCard’s counterparty credit rating to A-/A-2, subordinated debt rating to BBB+ and placed MasterCard on negative outlook. Following the announcement of the ownership and governance transactions, S&P placed us on credit watch with negative implications. Pending completion of the initial public offering, S&P expects to lower our counterparty credit ratings to BBB+/A-2 and our subordinated debt rating to BBB, both with stable outlook. Until such time, the existing ratings will remain on credit watch with negative implications. Once the lower ratings are in effect, the facility fee for our Credit Facility will increase to 8 basis points on the total commitment, or approximately $1.8 million annually, and interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility would increase to LIBOR plus 37 basis points (or 47 basis points if aggregate borrowings exceed 33% of the commitments) or an alternative base rate. MasterCard Europe and European Payment System Services sprl, a subsidiary of MasterCard, have a 1 million euro overdraft facility for MasterCard Europe and European Payment System Services sprl and a 1 million euro guarantee facility for MasterCard Europe. Interest on borrowings under the overdraft facility is charged at 50 basis points over the relevant market index and interest for the guarantee facility is paid at a rate of 1.5% per annum on outstanding guarantees. There were no material borrowings under these facilities at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Deutsche Bank AG is the lender of these facilities and is a member of MasterCard International. MasterCard Europe has one additional uncommitted credit agreement totaling 100 million euros. The interest rate under this facility is Euro LIBOR plus 50 basis points per annum for amounts below 100 million euros and Euro LIBOR plus 250 basis points for amounts over the 100 million euro limit. For drawings in currencies other than the euro, interest will be charged at the above margins over the relevant currency base rate. There were no borrowings under this agreement at December 31, 2005 and 2004. HSBC Bank plc is the lender of this facility and is a member of MasterCard International. After the consummation of the initial public offering, we intend to adopt a policy of declaring, subject to legally available funds, a quarterly cash dividend for our Class A common stock and Class B common stock, unless our board of directors, in its sole discretion, determines otherwise. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes, as of December 31, 2005, our contractual non-cancelable obligations that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances. Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years More Than 5 Years (In millions) Capital leases1 $ 57 $ 5 $ 7 $ 3 $ 42 Operating leases2 113 35 49 21 8 Sponsorship, licensing & other3 551 288 225 31 7 U.S. merchant lawsuit and other legal settlements4 789 189 200 200 200 Debt5 243 5 88 150 — Executive incentive plan benefit6 62 62 — — — Total $ 1,815 $ 584 $ 569 $ 405 $ 257 54 Table of Contents 1 Most capital leases relate to certain property, plant and equipment used in our business. Our largest capital lease relates to our Kansas City, Missouri co-processing facility. 2 We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business, including the lease on our facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements. 3 Amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the MasterCard brand. The amounts included are fixed and non-cancelable. In addition, these amounts include amounts due in accordance with leases for computer hardware, software licenses and other service agreements. Future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for increased transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are indeterminable and contingent until such time as performance has occurred. MasterCard has accrued $304 million as of December 31, 2005 related to these agreements. 4 Represents amounts due in accordance with legal settlements, including the settlement agreement in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. 5 Debt primarily represents principal and interest owed on our subordinated notes due June 2008 and the principal owed on our Series A Senior Secured Notes due September 2009. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements herein. We also have various credit facilities for which there were no outstanding balances at December 31, 2005 that, among other things, would provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our members. Our debt obligations would change if one or more of our members failed and we borrowed under these credit facilities to settle on our members’ behalf or for other reasons. 6 Represents Executive Incentive Plan and the Senior Executive Incentive Plan cash payments to be paid in 2006 and amounts currently due to employees should they terminate employment. See Note 11 of our Consolidated Financial Statements herein. These amounts exclude the portion of the award that is eligible to be converted to restricted stock units. Related Parties We have approximately 1,493 existing stockholders who are also our customers. See Part III, Item 13—“Certain Relationships and Related Transactions”—of this Report for a description of certain agreements between us and our principal stockholders. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. In 2005, the net revenues from these customers were approximately $981 million, or 33% of total net revenue. In January 2006, one of these customers purchased another of our key customers (not among our top five revenue contributors). Accordingly, the amounts for 2005 for this customer include the revenues of the other customer acquired. The loss of any of these members could adversely impact our revenues and net income. See “Risk Factors—Business Risks—Consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for MasterCard and may create pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. In addition, as part of our business strategy, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Business Risks—We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in Part I, Item 1A of this Report. Seasonality Portions of our business are seasonal. Our gross revenue is favorably affected by progressively increased card purchasing volume throughout the year, particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday shopping period. However, advertising, holiday promotions and incentives also increase correspondingly, generally causing our profitability to decline in the fourth quarter. 55 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Revenue Recognition Our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly GDV are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers’ performance. Total assessment revenues included an estimate as of the end of the period for 15%, 11% and 12% of those assessment revenues, representing 5%, 4% and 4% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our revenue recognition policies are fully described in our Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly GDV are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers’ performance. Such estimates are subsequently validated against performance reported by our customers. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. Customers’ performance is estimated by using historical performance, member reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers. If our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Historically, our estimates have differed from the actual performance by less than 5% of the estimates on a quarterly basis. Rebates and incentives are estimated. Rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra-revenue based on our estimate of each customer’s performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements. If our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, contra-revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Legal and Regulatory Matters We are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. Except as described in Notes 16 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“SFAS No. 5”). Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. 56 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Discount Rate for Merchant Lawsuit Settlement We have entered into a settlement agreement in connection with the U.S. merchant lawsuit. This settlement was discounted over the ten year payment term of the settlement. We estimated the discount rate we used to calculate the present value of our obligations under the Settlement Agreement in 2003 to be 8%. The discount rate used was a matter of management judgment at the time of the settlement, which considered our expected post-settlement credit rating and rates for sources of credit that could be used to finance the payment of such obligations with similar terms. A 1 percent increase in the discount rate would increase annual interest expense by approximately $4 million in 2006, and declining amounts thereafter. The reverse impact would be experienced for a 1 percent decrease in the discount rate. In addition, a 1 percent change in the discount rate would have impacted the amount we recorded as an after-tax charge for the year ended December 31, 2003 by approximately $20 million. Goodwill and Intangible Assets (except Capitalized Software) We perform analyses of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. This evaluation utilizes a two-step approach. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over fair value. The test methods employed in performing the analyses involve assumptions concerning interest and discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. The assumptions employed are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data. We utilize independent valuation experts, if needed. We completed our annual impairment testing for all other goodwill and intangibles using the methodology described herein, and no significant impairment charges were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2005. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with goodwill and/or intangible assets. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, excluding capitalized software, was $376 million, including $172 million of unamortized customer relationships, as of December 31, 2005. Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate we need to make decisions regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We have various tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions, establishment of reserves for credits and audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ by a material amount. 57 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we realize a deferred tax asset in excess of the net deferred tax asset or if we were unable to realize a net deferred tax asset; an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase or decrease earnings, respectively, in the period. Capitalized Software Our capitalized software, which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use, is included in other intangible assets. We are required to make judgments to determine if each project will satisfy its intended use. In addition, we estimate the average internal costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by department for the employees who directly devote time relating to the design, development and testing phases of the project. If actual results are not consistent with our judgments, we may be exposed to an impairment charge. The net carrying value of capitalized software as of December 31, 2005 was $94 million. On an ongoing basis, we perform impairment analyses on various technologies. If the carrying value of the various technologies exceeds the fair value, impairment charges are recorded. During the year ended December 31, 2005, no significant impairment charges were recorded. Pensions and Postretirement Benefit Plans The Company maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan with a cash balance feature covering substantially all of its U.S. employees. This pension plan credits participants annually with an amount equal to a percentage of eligible pay based on age and service, as well as providing earnings credits based on each participant’s account balance. Additionally, the Company has an unfunded nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan that provides certain key employees with supplemental retirement benefits in excess of limits imposed on qualified plans by U.S. tax laws. The Company also maintains a postretirement plan The discount rate for the Company pension and postretirement plans is subject to change, each year, consistent with changes in high-quality, long-term corporate bond markets. We referenced the Moody’s Aa Corporate Bond Index, arithmetically rounded, to select our discount rate to measure the projected benefit obligations of our pension and postretirement plans. In order to validate the appropriateness of the rate, an analysis was performed which matched the plans expected cash flows (determined on a PBO basis) with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high-grade non-callable corporate bonds A quarter of a percentage point decrease in our discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) by $1.2 million, and would have a negligible effect on our annual pension expense. An equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a quarter of a percentage point increase in the discount rate. 58 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions providing health coverage and life insurance benefits for substantially all of its U.S. employees and retirees. Certain assumptions are used in the determination of the annual costs for our pension and postretirement plans and the disclosure of the funded position of our plans. Key assumptions include the discount rate used to measure the plans’ projected benefit obligation for pension and postretirement, the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and the health care cost trend rate for our postretirement plan. generating a discount rate. Our discount rate of 5.50% as of December 31, 2005 was reasonable as compared to the rate derived from the analysis described above. This rate of 5.50% is a decline of 25 basis points from the 5.75% rate used in calculating the net periodic benefit costs for 2004. Net actuarial gains and/or losses in our benefit plans are amortized on straight-line basis over the expected average remaining service of active participants expected to benefit under the plans. We determine the expected return on plan assets primarily based on long-term historical returns in equity and fixed income markets. The expected rate of our pension plan assets is 8.50% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. A quarter of a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase the annual pension costs by $0.4 million. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends to determine the health care trend rates for postretirement medical costs. A complete analysis of the cost impact resulting from a change in this assumption is fully described in Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued FASB Staff Position (“FSP”) No. FAS 109-2 (“FSP 109-2”), “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (the “Act”). FSP 109-2 provides enterprises more time (beyond the financial reporting period during which the Act took effect) to evaluate the Act’s impact on the enterprise’s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes.” We are not presently intending to repatriate any foreign earnings as defined under the Act. Therefore, FSP 109-2 is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123 (revised 2004) (“SFAS 123R”), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS 123R provides guidance on accounting for transactions in which an entity obtains employee services in exchange for share-based payments. The Company intends to adopt SFAS 123R in connection with the implementation of equity based compensation plans as part of the Company’s new ownership and governance structure. The implementation date of these plans has not been determined and the underlying transactions remain subject to approval by the Company’s stockholders. The adoption of SFAS 123R is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 59 Table of Contents In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 “Accounting Changes and Error Corrections—a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3” (“SFAS 154”). SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods’ financial statements for changes in accounting principles, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period-specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. SFAS 154 also requires that a change in depreciation, amortization, or depletion method for long-lived, non-financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. The implementation of SFAS 154 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and equity price risk. We have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies, which have been approved by the board of directors, governing our funding, investments, and use of derivative financial instruments. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. There have been no material changes in our market risk exposures at December 31, 2005 as compared to December 31, 2004. Foreign Exchange Risk We enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements denominated in foreign currencies. We also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro. The terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, forward currency contracts against the U.S. dollar were both purchased (with notional amounts of $78 million and $41 million, respectively) and sold (with notional amounts of $33 million and $20 million, respectively). Based on the year-end 2005 and 2004 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the U.S. dollar is estimated to create a loss valued at $4 million and $2 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, forward currency contracts against the euro were purchased (with notional amounts of $218 million and $128 million, respectively) and sold (with notional amounts of $39 million and no open contracts, respectively). Based on the year-end 2005 and 2004 foreign exchange positions, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent strengthening of the euro is estimated to create a loss valued at $16 million and $11 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This risk is limited to the extent that the timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions is typically one business day and by limiting the supported settlement currencies to the U.S. dollar or one of nineteen other stable transaction currencies. The remaining 146 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure. Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments, which we hold as available-for-sale investments. They are rated AA or above and primarily consist of fixed rate short and medium-term instruments. With respect to fixed maturities, our general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity 60 Table of Contents and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. Based on the net present value of expected future cash flows, a 100 basis point increase in interest rates, assuming a parallel shift of the yield curve, would result in fair value changes and an unrealized loss recorded in other comprehensive income of $19 million and $17 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our held-to-maturity investments are not subject to interest rate movements. Our interest rate sensitive liabilities consist of subordinated debt securities. A 100 basis point decrease in rates would result in a fair value loss of $5 million and $9 million for December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures, settlement service operations and other operational needs. These credit facilities have variable rates, which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement. There were 4 million euros and no amounts outstanding at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, under these credit facilities. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements herein. Equity Price Risk We own trading securities, which are comprised of equity securities selected to offset obligations in connection with an executive compensation plan. The effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would result in a loss of $2 million and $3 million in the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. To the extent the executive compensation plan remains in a net appreciation position, an offsetting gain would be recorded in general and administrative expense. 61 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:52:43.684750

1141391,MA,Mastercard Inc,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard International”) and MasterCard Europe sprl (“MasterCard Europe”) (together, “MasterCard” or the “Company”) included elsewhere in this Report. Non-GAAP Financial Information Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, portions of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” include a comparison of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures discussed below facilitate an understanding of our results of operations and provide a more meaningful comparison of our results between periods. Specifically, we are presenting operating expenses excluding: • Litigation settlements in 2007; • Non-cash charge associated with the donation of shares of Class A common stock to the MasterCard Foundation and litigation settlements in 2006; and • Catch-up adjustment relating to cash award executive incentive plans and litigation settlements in 2005. See “—Operating Expenses” for a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding the special items above to the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Similarly, we present the effective tax rate with and without the impact of the stock donation to The MasterCard Foundation (the “Foundation”) for the year ended December 31, 2006 because the stock donation to the Foundation is a non-cash and non-recurring item that was completed in conjunction with our change in governance and ownership structure implemented during the second quarter of 2006. We believe the effective tax rate without the impact of the stock donation to the Foundation is more meaningful to investors in understanding our financial results, including comparability to the same periods in 2007 and 2005. Finally, we are presenting in 2007 and 2006 gross assessments growth excluding a reclassification from assessments to currency conversion and cross-border revenues and SEPA pricing increases. We believe the gross assessments growth rate excluding these items is representative of the core growth in these revenues. Overview We are a global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of our customers’ credit, debit and related payment programs. We manage a family of well-known, widely accepted payment card brands including MasterCard®, MasterCard Electronic™, Maestro® and Cirrus®, which we license to our customers. As part of managing these brands, we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card system. Cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers. Accordingly, we do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands. 45 Table of Contents We recorded net income of $1.1 billion, or $8.00 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus $50 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in 2006. Our liquidity and capital position remain strong, with $3.0 billion in cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale securities and $3.0 billion in stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2007. Net revenue growth of 22.3% in 2007 was primarily due to increased transactions and volumes. The foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and the Brazilian real against the dollar accounted for 3.1% of the growth while approximately 2% of our 2007 net revenue growth was due to the impact of pricing adjustments. Operating expenses decreased 4.4% in 2007. This decrease in operating expenses includes a 1.8% favorable impact for the foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. Excluding the impact of special items specifically identified in the reconciliation table included in “—Operating Expenses”, operating expenses increased 10.4% in the year ended December 31, 2007. In 2007, the increase in operating expenses, excluding the impact of special items, was primarily due to an increase in general and administrative expenses to support our customer focused strategy. Our operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues were 72.8% in 2007 versus 93.1% in 2006. Excluding the impact of special items, our operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues in 2007 declined to 72.7% from 80.5% in 2006. Other income in 2007 includes realized gains of approximately $391 million for the partial sale of an available-for-sale security, Redecard S.A. and $90 million from the organization that operates the World Cup soccer events in resolution of all outstanding disputes pertaining to our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events. See “—Other Income (Expense)”. Regulatory actions, litigation, consolidation within the banking industry and the growing power of merchants may lead us to change our pricing arrangements, reducing our overall revenues and having an adverse impact on our business. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors” of this Report for these and other risks facing our business. We believe the trend within the global payments industry from paper-based forms of payment, such as cash and checks, toward electronic forms of payment, such as cards, creates significant opportunities for the continued growth of our business. Our strategy is to continue our growth by further penetrating our existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and higher-growth segments of the global payments industry (such as premium/affluent and contactless cards, commercial payments and debit), enhancing our merchant relationships, growing acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands. We also intend to pursue incremental payment processing opportunities throughout the world. We are committed to providing our customers with coordinated services through integrated, dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs, marketing, product development, technology, processing, consulting and information services. By investing in strong customer relationships over the long-term, we believe that we can increase our volume of business with customers over time. Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our operations are impacted by changes in foreign exchange rates. In most regions except Europe, assessments are calculated based on local currency volume converted to U.S. dollar volume using average exchange rates for the related assessment period. In Europe, the local currency volumes are converted to the euro. As a result, assessment revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar or euro compared to the foreign currencies of the related local volumes in each period. In 2007 and 2006, gross dollar volume (“GDV”) on a U.S. dollar converted basis increased 18.4% and 16.1%, respectively, exceeding local currency GDV growth of 14.4% and 15.4%, compared to the same periods in the prior year, indicating the weakening of the U.S. dollar. We are especially impacted by the movements of the euro and the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar since the functional currency of MasterCard Europe, our principal European operating subsidiary, is the euro and the functional currency of our Brazilian subsidiary is the Brazilian real. The strengthening or devaluation of the 46 Table of Contents U.S. dollar against the euro and Brazilian real impacts the translation of our European and Brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the U.S. dollar. The impact on operating results for each of the years stated is summarized as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Revenue growth attributable to translation of euro and real revenues to U.S. dollars 3.1 % 0.5 % 0.5 % Operating expense growth attributable to translation of euro and real expenses to U.S. dollars 1.8 % 0.5 % 0.4 % Revenues We generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services (operations fees) and by charging assessments to our customers based on the GDV of activity on the cards that carry our brands (assessments). GDV includes the aggregated dollar amount of usage (purchases, cash disbursements, balance transfers and convenience checks) on MasterCard-branded cards. Our pricing for transactions and services is complex. Each category of revenue has numerous fee components depending on the types of transactions or services provided. We review our pricing and implement changes on an ongoing basis. In addition, standard pricing varies by region and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements. Our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. We earned approximately 73.8%, 73.1% and 66.1% of our net revenues from net operations fees and approximately 26.2%, 26.9% and 33.9% of our net revenues from net assessments in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Approximately 3.3% of the shift to operation fees from assessments in 2006 was due to the restructuring of our currency conversion pricing in April 2006. Operations fees are typically transaction-based but may also be volume based and are charged for facilitating the processing and acceptance of payment transactions and information management among our customers. MasterCard’s system for transaction processing involves four participants in addition to us: issuers (the cardholders’ banks), acquirers (the merchants’ banks), merchants and cardholders. Operations fees are charged to issuers, acquirers or their delegated processors for transaction processing services, specific programs to promote MasterCard-branded card acceptance and additional services to assist our customers in managing their businesses. The significant components of operations fees are as follows: • Authorization occurs when a merchant requests approval for a cardholder’s transaction. We charge a fee for routing the authorization for approval to or from the issuer or, in certain circumstances, such as when the issuer’s systems are unavailable, for approval by us or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuer’s instructions. Our rules, which vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. • Settlement refers to the process in which we determine the amounts due between issuers and acquirers for payment transactions and associated fees. First, we clear a transaction by transferring the financial transaction details among issuers, acquirers or their designated third-party processors. Then we settle or exchange the related funds among the issuers and acquirers. We charge a fee for these settlement and clearing services. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. • Switch fees are charges for the use of the MasterCard Debit Switch (the “MDS”), our debit processing system. The MDS transmits financial messages between acquirers and issuers and provides transaction and statistical reporting and performs settlement between customers and other debit transaction processing networks. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. • Currency conversion and cross-border are volume-based revenues. Cross-border volumes are generated by transactions in which the cardholder and merchant geography are different. We have the ability to process transactions denominated in more than 160 currencies through our global system, providing cardholders the ability to utilize, and merchants to accept, MasterCard cards across multiple country 47 Table of Contents borders. We can also perform currency conversion services by processing transactions in a merchant’s local currency and converting the amount to the currency of the issuer, who in turn may add foreign exchange charges and post the transaction on the cardholder’s statement in their own home currency. In April 2006, we restructured our currency conversion by initiating a charge to our issuers and acquirers for all cross-border transaction volumes regardless of whether we perform the currency conversion or it is performed by a third party at the point-of-sale. We also generally decreased the price we charge our issuers for performing currency conversion. • Acceptance development fees are charged to issuers based on components of GDV and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale. These fees are primarily U.S.-based. • Warning bulletin fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants. • Connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment, and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. • Consulting and research fees are primarily generated by MasterCard Advisors, our professional advisory services group. We provide a wide range of consulting and research services associated with our customers’ payment activities and programs. Research includes revenues from subscription-based services, access to research inquiry, and peer networking services generated by our independent financial and payments industry research group. We do not anticipate consulting and research fees becoming a significant percentage of our business. • Other operations fees represent various revenue streams, including cardholder services, a variety of account and transaction enhancement services, fees for U.S. acquirers accepting transactions from cardholders with non-U.S. issuers, compliance and penalty fees, holograms and publications. Cardholder services are benefits provided with MasterCard-branded cards, such as insurance, telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines. Generally, we process the majority of MasterCard-branded domestic transactions in the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and Australia. We process substantially all cross-border transactions using MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards. We charge relatively higher operations fees for settlement, authorization and switch fees on cross-border transactions and earn cross-border revenues as well as currency conversion revenues if the transactions require conversion between two different currencies. Operations fees for offline debit transactions, which are generally signature-based debit transactions, are priced similar to credit transactions. Operations fees for processing domestic online debit transactions are priced in a similar manner as domestic offline debit and credit transactions, while cross-border offline debit and credit transactions are priced higher than cross-border online debit transactions. Assessments are primarily based on a customer’s GDV for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the region and nature of the transactions that generate GDV. Most of our assessment rates are tiered and rates decrease when customers meet incremental volume hurdles. These assessment rates also vary by the type of transaction. We generally assess at higher rates for cross-border volumes compared to domestic volumes. We also assess at higher rates for retail purchases versus cash withdrawals. Credit and offline debit transactions are assessed at higher rates than online debit transactions. In addition, from time to time we may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs. Assessments that are based on quarterly GDV are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance. In 2007 and 2006, gross revenues grew 20.4% and 19.5%, respectively. A component of our revenue growth in each year is attributable to pricing changes. Our overall revenue growth is being moderated by the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives. Accordingly, we have entered into business agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide GDV and other performance- 48 Table of Contents based support incentives. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross revenues were approximately 24.6%, 25.7% and 21.6% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The rebates and incentives are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs. Rebates and incentives increased $173 million, or 15.0%, and $341 million, or 42.1%, in 2007 and 2006, respectively. These increases reflect enhanced competition in the global payments industry, the continued consolidation and globalization of our customers, the growing power of merchants and the impact of pricing changes. The United States remains our largest geographic market based on revenues. Revenue generated in the United States was approximately 49.7%, 52.3% and 54.8% of total revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of total revenues in any period. Certain non-U.S. economies have experienced stronger growth than the U.S. economy. Accordingly, some non-U.S. revenues grew at a faster rate than U.S. revenues in 2007 and 2006. The growth was not specifically related to any one region in which we do business. Our business is dependent on certain world economies and consumer behaviors. In particular, a significant portion of our revenues are dependent on international travel patterns; which can vary with the strengthening or weakening of foreign currencies or the impact of specific events, such as terrorist attacks. Our revenues can also be impacted by a number of factors related to consumer behavior, including consumer confidence in the MasterCard brand.

Accordingly, shares and per share data were retroactively restated in the financial statements subsequent to the reclassification to reflect the reclassification as if it were effective at the start of the first period being presented in the financial statements. 2 The 2006 effective tax rate includes the impact of a $395 million donation of shares of Class A common stock to the Foundation, a charitable contribution which is not deductible for tax purposes. See “—Income Taxes” for more information. 3 In 2007, we updated GDV to exclude commercial funds transfers in China, which are generally transactions that facilitate the transfer of funds between bank branches but do not involve traditional cash withdrawals or balance transfers. Data for 2006 and 2005 have been restated to be consistent with this approach. 4 The data set forth for processed transactions represents all transactions processed by MasterCard, including PIN-based online debit transactions. In 2006, we updated our transaction detail to remove certain online debit transactions which did not result in a flow of funds, for example balance inquiry or failed transactions. Management determined that it would be more appropriate to exclude such transactions from the processed transactions calculation. The processed transactions in 2005 have been restated to be consistent with the calculation of processed transactions in 2006. Revenue has not been impacted by this change. Operations Fees The significant components in operations fees are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2007 2006 (In millions, except percents) Authorization, settlement and switch $ 1,382 $ 1,169 $ 1,055 $ 213 $ 114 18.2 % 10.8 % Currency conversion and cross border 868 622 317 246 305 39.5 % 96.2 % Acceptance development fees 271 217 171 54 46 24.9 % 26.9 % Warning bulletin fees 74 70 70 4 — 5.7 % — Connectivity 101 84 63 17 21 20.2 % 33.3 % Consulting and research fees 88 76 63 12 13 15.8 % 20.6 % Other operations fees 551 449 378 102 71 22.7 % 18.8 % Gross operations fees 3,335 2,687 2,117 648 570 24.1 % 26.9 % Rebates (332 ) (257 ) (176 ) (75 ) (81 ) 29.2 % 46.0 % Net operations fees $ 3,003 $ 2,430 $ 1,941 $ 573 $ 489 23.6 % 25.2 % • Authorization, settlement and switch revenues increased due to the number of transactions processed through our systems, increasing 16.2% and 17.5% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007, approximately 2% of this increase in revenue was attributable to higher utilization and pricing increases for stand-in authorization services. Stand-in occurs when the issuer’s primary authorization routing options fail and MasterCard approves the requests on behalf of the issuer based on pre-defined issuer parameters. These increases in revenues were partially offset in 2007 and 2006 by 0.9% and 3.0%, respectively, due to the implementation of price changes in April 2006 to make our pricing compliant with the Single European Payment Area (“SEPA”) initiative. The SEPA price changes were slightly positive on a total gross revenue basis; however, these changes impact individual revenue categories, in particular authorization, settlement 50 Table of Contents and switch, currency conversion and cross-border revenues and assessments. In addition, settlement revenue increased $3 million in 2007 and declined $15 million in 2006 relating to foreign exchange gains due to exchange rate volatility on settlement activities. • Currency conversion and cross-border revenues increased due to an increase in cross-border volumes of 21.1% and 14.7% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, and due to the restructuring of currency conversion pricing in April 2006. We restructured our currency conversion pricing by initiating a charge to our issuers, and, in most regions, acquirers for all cross-border transactions regardless of whether we perform the currency conversion or it is performed by a third party at the point of sale. We also generally decreased the price we charge our issuers for currency conversion. Of the increases, $31 million and $108 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, were due to the reclassification of certain assessment revenues in Europe to cross-border volume revenue. • Acceptance development fees increased in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to increased volumes and the introduction of a new fee. The new fee was implemented in June 2007 which resulted in a 7.5% increase in acceptance development fees in 2007 compared to 2006. In addition, we began an exclusivity relationship with one merchant in the fourth quarter of 2006 that increased transaction volumes and accordingly, acceptance development fees by 3.1% in 2007. • Warning bulletin fees fluctuate with our customer requests for distribution of invalid or fraudulent account information. • Connectivity revenues increased due to increased volumes. • Consulting and research fees increased, primarily due to new engagements with our customers in 2007 and 2006. Our business agreements with certain customers may include consulting services as an incentive. Approximately 38.2% of consulting and research fees in 2007, as compared to 36.9% in 2006, were generated by new engagements which were provided to customers as a component of incentive agreements. This type of incentive increases consulting fees and reduces assessments. • Other operations fees represent various revenue streams, including cardholder services, compliance and penalty fees, holograms, user pay for a variety of account and transaction enhancement services, and manuals and publications. No increase in any component of other operations fees was material, other than the following: ­ Implementation of a new account enhancement program which resulted in an increase of $24 million in 2007. ­ Transactions from U.S. acquirers with non-U.S. issuers increased, accordingly, revenue from these transactions increased by $16 million and $8 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. ­ Cardholder services increased $7 million and $13 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively, due to an increase in account growth. • Rebates relating to operations fees are primarily based on transactions and volumes and, accordingly, increase as these variables increase. Rebates have been increasing due to renewals of customer agreements, ongoing consolidation of our customers and the impact of restructured pricing. Rebates as a percentage of gross operations fees were 10.0%, 9.6% and 8.3% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Assessments Assessments are revenues that are calculated based on our customers’ GDV. The components of assessments are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2007 2006 (In millions, except percents) Gross assessments $ 2,056 $ 1,790 $ 1,631 $ 266 $ 159 14.9 % 9.7 % Rebates and incentives (992 ) (894 ) (634 ) (98 ) (260 ) 11.0 % 41.0 % Net assessments $ 1,064 $ 896 $ 997 $ 168 $ (101 ) 18.8 % (10.1 )% 51 Table of Contents GDV growth was 14.4% and 15.4% in 2007 and 2006, respectively, when measured in local currency terms, and 18.4% and 16.1% when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. In 2007, gross assessments also grew due to an increase in assessable volumes for market development programs in specific countries within Europe. In 2006, a portion of our GDV growth related to an increase in online debit transactions which are priced at a lower assessment rate compared to credit and offline debit transactions. Accordingly, gross assessments in 2006 increased at a lower rate than GDV. In addition, revenue growth rates in 2007 and 2006 were impacted by a reclassification of $31 million and $108 million, respectively, from assessments to currency conversion and cross-border revenues, offset by $12 million and $33 million, respectively, in pricing increases related to our SEPA pricing changes. The increase in 2007 and 2006 gross assessments, excluding the net impact of the reclassifications and increase from the April 2006 pricing modifications from each period, would have been 11.3% and 14.3%, respectively. Rebates and incentives are primarily based on GDV but may also contain components for the issuance of new cards, launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs. The rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 48.2%, 49.9% and 38.9% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As gross assessments increase at a faster rate than rebates and incentives, the ratio of rebates and incentives to gross assessments will decline. Non-GDV performance-based incentives vary depending on the agreement terms and the timing of our customer’s performance. Accordingly, our incentives for non-GDV performance metrics, such as the issuance of new cards, the launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs, impact the relationship between gross assessments and net assessments. In 2007, 2006 and 2005, rebates and incentives compared to gross assessments fluctuated with the timing and structure of pricing arrangements with certain large customers and merchants. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and market development, U.S. merchant lawsuit and other litigation settlements, contributions to the Foundation and depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2007, there was a decrease in operating expenses of $137 million, or 4.4% compared to 2006. As described above, the following table shows a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding special items and as adjusted to the most directly comparable GAAP measure, which management believes creates a more meaningful comparison of results between periods: For the twelve months endedDecember 31, 2007 For the twelve months endedDecember 31, 2006 Actual SpecialItems Non-GAAP Actual SpecialItems Non-GAAP PercentIncrease(Decrease)Actual PercentIncrease(Decrease)As Adjusted (In millions, except percents) General and Administrative $ 1,758 $ — $ 1,758 $ 1,505 $ — $ 1,505 16.8 % 16.8 % Advertising and Marketing 1,080 — 1,080 1,052 — 1,052 2.7 % 2.7 % Litigation Settlements 3 (3 ) — 25 (25 ) — (86.4 )% — Charitable Contributions 20 — 20 415 (395 )1 20 (95.2 )% — Depreciation and Amortization 98 — 98 100 — 100 (2.1 )% (2.1 )% Total operating expenses $ 2,959 $ (3 ) $ 2,956 $ 3,097 $ (420 ) $ 2,677 (4.4 )% 10.4 % Total operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues 72.8 % 72.7 % 93.1 % 80.5 % 1 Contribution of stock to the MasterCard Foundation 52 Table of Contents In 2006, there was an increase in operating expenses of $552 million, or 21.7% compared to 2005. During 2005, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 86.6%, including two special items of litigation settlements for $75 million and $19 million for an adjustment to reflect our accounting methodology change for cash-based executive incentive plans. Excluding the two special items in 2005, operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues was 83.4% and the as adjusted increase in operating expenses was $227 million, or 9.2%, in 2006 compared to 2005. General and Administrative The major components of general and administrative expenses are as follows: For the years ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2007 2006 (In millions, except percents) Personnel $ 1,156 $ 966 $ 890 $ 190 $ 76 19.7 % 8.5 % Professional fees 220 180 135 40 45 22.2 % 33.3 % Travel and entertainment 106 97 84 9 13 9.3 % 15.5 % Telecommunications 71 70 71 1 (1 ) 1.4 % (1.4 )% Data processing 63 59 62 4 (3 ) 6.8 % (4.8 )% Other 142 133 110 9 23 6.8 % 20.9 % General and administrative expenses $ 1,758 $ 1,505 $ 1,352 $ 253 $ 153 16.8 % 11.3 % • Personnel consists of employee compensation, benefits, training, recruiting and severance costs, as well as contractor and temporary personnel costs. Personnel increased in 2007 and 2006 for additional staff to support customer-facing, technology and product areas. In addition, we increased personnel performance incentive accruals, as a result of better performance against company objectives. Partially offsetting the increase in 2006 were the following activities in 2005: - Changing our methodology of recognizing the cost of executive incentive cash award plans, which resulted in a catch-up adjustment of $19 million. - Updating the assumptions for our actuarial determined severance plan accrual which resulted in higher severance costs of $20 million. • Professional fees consist of expenses for consulting, legal, accounting and tax services. Professional fees increased in 2007 and 2006 primarily due to consulting services used to execute our strategy and legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation. • Travel and entertainment expenses are incurred primarily for travel to customer and regional meetings and accordingly have increased with the corresponding increase in our business activity. In 2006, there also was increased travel for 2006 World Cup soccer related activities. • Telecommunications expense consists of costs to support our global payments system infrastructure as well as our other telecommunication needs. • Data processing consists of expenses to operate and maintain MasterCard’s computer systems. These expenses vary with system changes, maintenance and usage. • Other includes rental expense for our facilities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous administrative expenses. Advertising and Marketing Our approach to advertising and marketing activities combines advertising, sponsorships, promotions, interactive media and public relations as part of an integrated program designed to increase MasterCard brand awareness/preference and usage of MasterCard cards. Advertising and market development expenses increased 53 Table of Contents $28 million, or 2.7%, in 2007 and increased $44 million, or 4.3%, in 2006. The growth in 2007 primarily related to the impact of foreign currency fluctuation of the euro to the U.S. dollar. In addition, in 2007 and 2006 the timing of certain advertising and market development expenses varied due to their relationship to specific sponsorships or promotions. We intend to continue to sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences. In 2007, our advertising and marketing activities supported multiple sponsorships. In 2006, however we allocated a significant amount of resources to support the sponsorship of the 2006 World Cup soccer events. During 2007, we reached an agreement to discontinue our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events. Costs associated with offering cardholder benefits, such as insurance and travel assistance, for certain programs are included within advertising and marketing. In 2007, these costs increased due to new program benefits and an increase in account growth. Our brands, principally MasterCard, are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets. Our marketing initiatives continue to support our customer-focused strategy. We are committed to maintaining and enhancing our brands and image through advertising and marketing efforts on a global scale. We will continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels. Merchant Lawsuit and Other Litigation Settlements In the first quarter of 2003, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $721 million ($469 million after-tax) consisting of (i) the monetary amount of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement (discounted at 8 percent over the payment term), (ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in order to comply with, other requirements of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement, and (iii) costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. The $721 million pre-tax charge amount was an estimate, which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the U.S. merchant lawsuit settlement agreement by the court and other factors. We are also a party to a number of other litigations. Based upon litigation developments and/or settlement negotiations in these other litigations and pursuant to Statement of Financial Standards No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies”, we recorded reserves for certain of these other litigations in 2006 and 2007.

1141391,MA,Mastercard Inc,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes of MasterCard Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries, including MasterCard International Incorporated (“MasterCard International”) and MasterCard Europe sprl (“MasterCard Europe”) (together, “MasterCard” or the “Company”) included elsewhere in this Report. Non-GAAP Financial Information Non-GAAP financial information is defined as a numerical measure of a company’s performance that excludes or includes amounts so as to be different than the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation S-K, portions of this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” include a comparison of certain non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. MasterCard has presented non-GAAP financial measures to enhance an investor’s evaluation of MasterCard’s ongoing operating results and to aid in forecasting future periods. MasterCard’s management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to, among other things, evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results, for internal planning and forecasting purposes and in the calculation of performance-based compensation. More specifically, with respect to the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this discussion: • Operating expenses—Litigation settlements have been excluded since MasterCard monitors litigation settlements separately from ongoing operations and evaluates ongoing operating performance without these settlements. See “—Operating Expenses” for a table which provides a reconciliation of operating expenses excluding litigation settlements to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to allow for a more meaningful comparison of results between periods. • Operating expenses—The non-cash charge associated with the donation of shares of Class A common stock to the MasterCard Foundation (the “Foundation”) have been excluded to provide a comparison of the ongoing operating expenses of the business and since MasterCard evaluates operations of the business without these expenses. • Effective income tax rate—The income tax impacts associated with litigation settlements and the stock donation to the MasterCard Foundation have been excluded to provide a comparison of the effective income tax rate associated with ongoing operations of the business. See “—Income Taxes” for a table which provides a reconciliation of the effective income tax rate excluding litigation settlements and the stock donation to the MasterCard Foundation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure to allow for a more meaningful comparison of results between periods. • Gross assessments growth rate—The 2007 gross assessments growth rate is presented excluding a reclassification from assessments to currency conversion and cross-border revenues and Single European Payment Area (“SEPA”) pricing increases. The gross assessments growth rate excluding these items allows for a more meaningful comparison of assessment revenues between periods. 47 Table of Contents Overview MasterCard is a leading global payment solutions company that provides a variety of services in support of the credit, debit and related payment programs of over 24,000 financial institutions and other entities that are our customers. We develop and market payment solutions, process payment transactions, and provide support services to our customers and, depending upon the service, to merchants and other clients. We manage a family of well-known, widely accepted payment card brands, including MasterCard®, MasterCard Electronic™, Maestro® and Cirrus®, which we license to our customers. As part of managing these brands, we also establish and enforce rules and standards surrounding the use of our payment card network. We generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services (operations fees) and by assessing our customers based primarily on the dollar volume of activity on the cards that carry our brands (assessments). Cardholder and merchant relationships are managed principally by our customers. Accordingly, we do not issue cards, extend credit to cardholders, determine the interest rates (if applicable) or other fees charged to cardholders by issuers, or establish the merchant discount charged by acquirers in connection with the acceptance of cards that carry our brands. We recorded a net loss of $254 million, or $1.95 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus net income of $1.1 billion, or $8.00 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2007 and net income of $50 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, in 2006. As of December 31, 2008, our liquidity and capital positions remained strong, with $2.1 billion in cash, cash equivalents and current available-for-sale securities and $1.9 billion in stockholders’ equity as of December 31, 2008. Net revenue growth of 22.7% in 2008 was primarily due to increased transactions and volumes. The foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and the Brazilian real against the dollar contributed 2.5 percentage points of the increase while pricing adjustments contributed approximately 6 percentage points to the net revenue growth. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we began to experience a slowdown in purchase volumes and transactions, primarily due to economic conditions around the world. See “—Business Environment Challenges” for additional information. Our operating expenses increased 86.7% in 2008. Excluding the impact of special items specifically identified in the reconciliation table included in “—Operating Expenses”, operating expenses increased 2.9% in 2008, of which 1.7 percentage points was due to foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar. The increase in operating expenses in 2008 was primarily due to litigation settlements. See “—Litigation Settlements” and Note 18 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information related to our litigation settlements. The increase in operating expenses in 2008, excluding the impact of special items, was primarily due to increases in general and administrative expenses and foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by decreases in advertising and marketing expenses. Our operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 110.7% in 2008, versus 72.8% in 2007 and 93.1% in 2006. Excluding the impact of special items, our operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 61.0% in 2008 versus 72.7% in 2007 and 80.5% in 2006. Other income in 2008 included realized gains of approximately $86 million for the sale of the remaining shares of an available-for-sale security, Redecard S.A., and $75 million related to the termination of a customer business agreement. Other income in 2007 included realized gains of approximately $391 million for the partial sale of our holdings of equity securities of Redecard S.A. that were classified as an available-for-sale security, and $90 million from the organization that operates the World Cup soccer events in resolution of all outstanding disputes pertaining to our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events. See “—Other Income (Expense)”. We believe the trend within the global payments industry from paper-based forms of payment, such as cash and checks, toward electronic forms of payment, such as card payment transactions, creates significant opportunities for the growth of our business. Our strategy is to continue to grow by further penetrating our 48 Table of Contents existing customer base and by expanding our role in targeted geographies and higher-growth segments of the global payments industry (such as premium/affluent and contactless cards, commercial payments, debit, prepaid and issuer processor and terminal driving services), enhancing our merchant relationships, expanding points of acceptance for our brands, seeking to maintain unsurpassed acceptance and continuing to invest in our brands. We also intend to pursue incremental payment processing opportunities throughout the world. We are committed to providing our customers with coordinated services through integrated, dedicated account teams in a manner that allows us to capitalize on our expertise in payment programs, marketing, product development, technology, processing and consulting and information services for these customers. By investing in strong customer relationships over the long-term, we believe that we can increase our volume of business with customers over time. See “—Business Environment Challenges” for discussion of environmental considerations related to our strategic objectives. 49 Table of Contents Financial Results* For the Years Ended December 31, Percent Increase (Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 (In millions, except per share, percentages and GDV amounts) Net operations fees $ 3,759 $ 3,003 $ 2,430 25.2 % 23.6 % Net assessments 1,233 1,064 896 15.9 % 18.8 % Total revenue 4,992 4,068 3,326 22.7 % 22.3 % General and administrative 1,914 1,758 1,505 8.8 % 16.8 % Advertising and marketing 1,018 1,080 1,052 (5.8) % 2.7 % Litigation settlements 2,483 3 25 ** (86.4) % Charitable contributions to the MasterCard Foundation — 20 415 (100.0) % (95.2) % Depreciation and amortization 112 98 100 14.7 % (2.1) % Total operating expenses 5,526 2,959 3,097 86.7 % (4.4) % Operating income (loss) (535) 1,108 229 (148.2) % 382.8 % Total other income 151 563 65 (73.1) % 771.0 % Income (loss) before income tax expense (383) 1,671 294 (122.9) % 468.2 % Income tax expense (benefit) (129) 586 244 (122.1) % 140.0 % Net income (loss) $ (254) $ 1,086 $ 50 (123.4) % 2,063.6 % Net income (loss) per share (basic) $ (1.95) 4 $ 8.05 4 $ 0.37 (124.2) % 2,075.7 % Weighted average shares outstanding (basic) 130 135 135 (3.5) % (0.4) % Net income (loss) per share (diluted) $ (1.95) 4 $ 8.00 4 $ 0.37 (124.4) % 2,062.2 % Weighted average shares outstanding (diluted) 130 136 136 (4.1) % (0.1) % Effective income tax rate 33.7 % 35.0 % 82.9 %1 ** ** Gross dollar volume (“GDV”) on a U.S. dollar converted basis (in billions) 2,533 2,272 1,919 2 11.5 % 18.4 % Processed transactions5 20,966 18,752 3 16,141 3 11.8 % 16.2 % * Note that figures in the above table may not sum due to rounding. ** Not meaningful, see “—Operating Expenses” and “—Litigation Settlements” for more information. 1 The 2006 effective tax rate includes the impact of a $395 million donation of shares of Class A common stock to the MasterCard Foundation, a charitable contribution which is not deductible for tax purposes. See “—Income Taxes” for more information. 2 In 2007, we updated GDV to exclude commercial funds transfers in China, which are generally transactions that facilitate the transfer of funds between bank branches but do not involve traditional cash withdrawals or balance transfers. Data for 2006 has been restated to be consistent with this approach. 3 In 2008, we updated our processed transactions numbers to apply reversals and include certain cash transactions. Prior period numbers have been restated to be consistent with this revised methodology. Revenue has not been impacted by these changes. 4 As more fully described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report, these amounts will be revised in accordance with the adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Staff Position Emerging Issues Task Force 03-6-1 on January 1, 2009. 5 The data set forth for processed transactions represents all transactions processed by MasterCard, including PIN-based online debit transactions. 50 Table of Contents Impact of Foreign Currency Rates Our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and Brazilian real. The functional currency of MasterCard Europe, our principal European operating subsidiary, is the euro, and the functional currency of our Brazilian subsidiary is the Brazilian real. Accordingly, the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus the euro and Brazilian real impacts the translation of our European and Brazilian subsidiaries’ operating results into the U.S. dollar. During 2008, 2007 and 2006, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro and Brazilian real, which increased revenues and expenses. More recently, the U.S. dollar has begun to strengthen against the euro and Brazilian real and if this trend continues, revenues and expenses will decrease. In addition, changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume (“GDV”) and gross euro volume (“GEV”), which are used in the calculation of our assessment revenues. In most non-European regions, GDV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. In Europe, GEV is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period. As a result, our assessment revenues are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar versus most non-European local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus European local currencies. In 2008 and 2007, GDV growth on a U.S. dollar converted basis was 11.5% and 18.4%, respectively, versus GDV growth on a local currency basis of 10.7% and 14.4%, respectively. Business Environment Challenges We process transactions from approximately 210 countries and territories and in more than 160 currencies. The competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business. The United States is our largest geographic market based on revenues. Revenue generated in the United States was approximately 47.2%, 49.7% and 52.3% of total revenues in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. No individual country, other than the United States, generated more than 10% of total revenues in any period. However, revenues generated from certain non-U.S. countries have grown faster than United States revenues due to differences in market maturity, economic health, price changes and foreign exchange fluctuations in those countries. While the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries, the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the United States makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the United States. During 2008, unprecedented events occurred in the financial markets around the world, resulting in distress in the credit environment, equity market volatility and government intervention. In particular, the economies of the United States and the United Kingdom were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil, however it also impacted other economies around the world. Some existing customers have gone bankrupt or have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by the government. Many of our financial institution customers, merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted. As a result, our operating results have begun to be impacted, or could be negatively impacted, in several ways, including but not limited to the following: • Our customers may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate increasing cardholder defaults. • Constriction of consumer and business confidence may cause decreased spending. • Declining economies can change consumer spending behaviors; for example, a significant portion of our revenues is dependent on international travel patterns, which may decline. • Mergers of our customers may lower our pricing due to the tiered pricing structure of most customer agreements, which typically offer lower pricing as higher business volumes are achieved. 51 Table of Contents • Consolidation of our customers can increase the bargaining power of our customers during new and renewal contract negotiations. • Uncertainty and volatility in our customers’ businesses makes our estimates of revenues, rebates and incentives more difficult. As such, certain prepayments under customer business agreements may not be realizable. • Our customers may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives. • Decreased spending by our customers for optional or enhanced services. • Government intervention and/or investments in our customers may lead to the nationalization of those banking institutions or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products. • Tightening of credit availability could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility. See “—Liquidity” for additional discussion of this committed, unsecured, revolving credit facility. • Our customers may default on their settlement obligations. See Note 21 (Settlement and Travelers Cheque Risk Management) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of our settlement exposure. In addition, our business is subject to regulation in many countries. Regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry. For example, see Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for a discussion of global interchange proceedings. Revenues We generate revenues from the fees that we charge our customers for providing transaction processing and other payment-related services (operations fees) and by charging assessments to our customers based on the GDV of activity on the cards that carry our brands (assessments). GDV includes the aggregated dollar amount of usage (purchases, cash disbursements, balance transfers and convenience checks) on MasterCard-branded cards. Our pricing for transactions and services is complex. Each category of revenue has numerous fee components depending on the types of transactions or services provided. We review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis and expect pricing to continue to be a component of revenue growth in the future. In addition, standard pricing varies among our regional businesses, and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements. Our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers. Operations fees are transaction-based and are also volume-based and are charged for facilitating the processing and acceptance of payment transactions and information management among our customers. MasterCard’s system for transaction processing involves four participants in addition to us: issuers (the cardholders’ banks), acquirers (the merchants’ banks), merchants and cardholders. Operations fees are charged to issuers, acquirers or their delegated processors for transaction processing services, specific programs to promote MasterCard-branded card acceptance and additional services to assist our customers in managing their businesses. The significant components of operations fees are as follows: • Authorization occurs when a merchant requests approval for a cardholder’s transaction. We charge a fee for routing the authorization for approval to and from the issuer or, in certain circumstances, such as when the issuer’s systems are unavailable, for approval by us or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with the issuer’s instructions. Our rules, which vary across regions, establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. • Settlement refers to the process in which we determine the amounts due between issuers and acquirers for payment transactions and associated fees. First, we clear a transaction by transferring the financial 52 Table of Contents transaction details among issuers, acquirers or their designated third-party processors. Then we settle or exchange the related funds among the issuers and acquirers. We charge a fee for these settlement and clearing services. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. • Switch fees are charges for the use of the MasterCard Debit Switch (the “MDS”). The MDS transmits financial messages between acquirers and issuers and provides transaction and statistical reporting and performs settlement between customers and other debit transaction processing networks. These fees are primarily paid by issuers. • Currency conversion and cross-border are volume-based revenues. Cross-border volumes are generated by transactions in which the cardholder and merchant geography are different. We process transactions denominated in more than 160 currencies through our global system, providing cardholders with the ability to utilize, and merchants to accept, MasterCard cards across multiple country borders. We charge issuers and acquirers for all cross-border volumes. We can also perform currency conversion services by processing transactions in a merchant’s local currency and converting the amount to the currency of the issuer, who in turn may add foreign exchange charges and post the transaction on the cardholder’s statement in their own home currency. We charge issuers for performing currency conversion. • Acceptance development fees are charged to issuers based on components of GDV and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale. These fees are primarily U.S.-based. • Warning bulletin fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants. • Connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access, equipment, and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages. These fees are based on the volume of information being transmitted through and the number of connections to our systems. • Consulting and research fees are primarily generated by MasterCard Advisors, our professional advisory services group. We provide a wide range of consulting and research services associated with our customers’ payment activities and programs. Research includes revenues from subscription-based services, access to research inquiry, and peer networking services generated by our independent financial and payments industry research group. We do not anticipate consulting and research fees becoming a significant percentage of our business. • Other operations fees represent various revenue streams, including cardholder services, a variety of account and transaction enhancement services, fees for U.S. acquirers accepting transactions from cardholders with non-U.S. issuers, compliance and penalty fees, holograms and publications. Cardholder services are benefits provided with MasterCard-branded cards, such as insurance, telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines. Assessment fees are primarily based on a customer’s GDV for a specific time period and the rates vary depending on the region and nature of the transactions that generate GDV. Assessments that are based on quarterly GDV are estimated utilizing aggregate transaction information and projected customer performance. From time to time, the Company may introduce assessments for specific purposes such as market development programs. Our gross revenues from operations fees and assessments vary and are dependent on the nature of the transactions and GDV generated from those transactions. The combination of the following transaction characteristics for operations and/or assessment fees determines the pricing: • Domestic or cross-border • Credit, online debit (PIN-based), offline debit (signature-based) • Tiered pricing with rates decreasing as customers meet incremental volume/transaction hurdles 53 Table of Contents • Geographic region or country • Retail purchase or cash withdrawal We process most of the cross-border transactions using MasterCard, Maestro and Cirrus-branded cards and process the majority of MasterCard-branded domestic transactions in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Brazil and Australia. Cross-border transactions generate greater revenue than domestic transactions due to higher operations fees for settlement, authorization and switch, and are also subject to cross-border and currency conversion fees. In addition, higher operations fees are charged on signature transactions than online transactions. In 2008 and 2007, gross revenues grew 19.8% and 20.4%, respectively. Revenue growth was the result of increased transactions and GDV, as well as price increases and currency fluctuation. Our overall revenue growth is being moderated by the demand from our customers for better pricing arrangements and greater rebates and incentives. Accordingly, we have entered into business agreements with certain customers and merchants to provide GDV and other performance-based support incentives. The rebates and incentives are calculated on a monthly basis based upon estimated performance and the terms of the related business agreements. Rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs. The continued consolidation of our customers and the growing influence of merchants have led to enhanced competition in the global payments industry and demand for better pricing arrangements. Our revenue growth was moderated by a $145 million, or 11.0%, and a $173 million, or 15.0%, increase in rebates and incentives to our customers and merchants in 2008 and 2007, respectively. A significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among our five largest customers. In 2008, the net revenues from these customers were approximately $1.5 billion, or 30%, of total net revenue. The loss of any of these customers or their significant card programs could adversely impact our revenues and net income. See “Risk Factors—Business Risks—Consolidation or other changes affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for MasterCard and may result in lower prices and/or more favorable terms for our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in Item 1A of this Report. In addition, as part of our business strategy, MasterCard, among other efforts, enters into business agreements with customers. These agreements can be terminated in a variety of circumstances. See “Risk Factors—Business Risks—We face increasingly intense competitive pressure on the prices we charge our customers, which may materially and adversely affect our revenue and profitability” in Item 1A of this Report. 54 Table of Contents Operations Fees The significant components in operations fees are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2008 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Authorization, settlement and switch $ 1,655 $ 1,382 $ 1,169 $ 273 $ 213 19.8 % 18.2 % Currency conversion and cross border 1,148 868 622 280 246 32.3 % 39.5 % Acceptance development fees 305 271 217 34 54 12.5 % 24.9 % Warning bulletin fees 75 74 70 1 4 1.4 % 5.7 % Connectivity 117 101 84 16 17 15.8 % 20.2 % Consulting and research fees 92 88 76 4 12 4.5 % 15.8 % Other operations fees 724 551 449 173 102 31.4 % 22.7 % Gross operations fees 4,116 3,335 2,687 781 648 23.4 % 24.1 % Rebates (357 ) (332 ) (257 ) (25 ) (75 ) 7.5 % 29.2 % Net operations fees $ 3,759 $ 3,003 $ 2,430 $ 756 $ 573 25.2 % 23.6 % • Authorization, settlement and switch revenues increased due to the number of transactions processed through our systems increasing 11.8% and 16.2% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, $49 million, or 3.5 percentage points of the 2008 percentage increase and $3 million, or 0.3 percentage points of the 2007 percentage increase, were due to net foreign exchange gains relating to exchange rate volatility on settlement activities. • Currency conversion and cross-border revenues increased primarily due to increases in cross-border volumes of 16.6% and 20.9% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In June 2008, we refined our methodology to calculate cross-border volume growth rates primarily by changing the definition of cross border volumes from volumes where the issuer country and acquirer country are different to volumes where the issuer country and merchant country are different. Prior period volume growth rates have been restated to be consistent with the revised methodology. In addition to the increase in cross-border volumes in 2008 and 2007, price increases have contributed to our revenue growth. Price increases on acquiring cross-border volumes implemented in January and October 2008 accounted for approximately 21 percentage points of the percentage increase in 2008. Also, a restructuring of our currency conversion pricing in 2006 accounted for approximately 5 percentage points of the percentage increase in 2007. • Acceptance development fees increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to increased volumes and the introduction of a new fee in April 2007. The new fee accounted for approximately 2 and 8 percentage points of the percentage increases in 2008 and 2007, respectively. In addition, 3 percentage points of the percentage increase in 2007 related to a merchant agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2006 that increased transaction volumes and accordingly, acceptance development fees. • Warning bulletin fees are primarily based on customer requests for distribution of invalid account information. • Connectivity revenues increased in 2008 and 2007 primarily due to increased data volumes. • Consulting and research fees remained relatively consistent in 2008 versus 2007 and increased in 2007 versus 2006. The increases in both years are primarily due to new engagements with our customers. Our business agreements with certain customers include consulting services as an incentive. Consulting services provided to customers as a result of incentive agreements were 61.5%, 38.2% and 36.9% of consulting and research fees in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 55 Table of Contents • Other operations fees represent various revenue streams, including cardholder services, compliance and penalty fees, holograms, user pay for a variety of account and transaction enhancement services, and manuals and publications. Significant components of the increase in other operations fees were as follows: • Our account enhancement program, implemented in the second quarter of 2007, coupled with increased usage resulted in revenue increases of $36 million and $24 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively. • Pricing for retail purchases in the U.S. by non-U.S. cardholders increased in January 2008. This price increase, coupled with an increase in retail purchase volumes, resulted in a revenue increase of $44 million in 2008. • Cardholder services increased $21 million and $7 million in 2008 and 2007, respectively, due to an increase in affluent account growth. • Rebates relating to operations fees are primarily based on transactions and volumes and, accordingly, increase as these variables increase. Rebates also have been increasing due to ongoing consolidation of our customers and the impact of restructured pricing. Rebates as a percentage of gross operations fees were 8.7%, 10.0% and 9.6% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During 2008, MasterCard had reduced rebates for certain customers that did not achieve contractual performance hurdles. Accordingly, these reductions in rebates decreased rebates as a percentage of gross operations fees. Assessments Assessments are revenues that are calculated based on our customers’ GDV. The components of assessments are as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, DollarIncrease (Decrease) PercentIncrease (Decrease) 2008 2007 2006 2008 2007 2008 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Gross assessments $ 2,345 $ 2,056 $ 1,790 $ 289 $ 266 14.1 % 14.9 % Rebates and incentives (1,112 ) (992 ) (894 ) (120 ) (98 ) 12.1 % 11.0 % Net assessments $ 1,233 $ 1,064 $ 896 $ 169 $ 168 15.9 % 18.8 % Gross assessments grew partially due to GDV growth of approximately 10.7% and 14.4% in 2008 and 2007, respectively, when measured in local currency terms and 11.5% and 18.4%, respectively, when measured on a U.S. dollar converted basis. Assessment revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar and euro compared to the foreign currencies of the related local volumes in each period. In October 2008, we increased certain assessment fees and introduced a new assessment fee to acquirers in Europe. These price changes in October 2008 contributed approximately 2 percentage points of the percentage increase in 2008. In 2007, gross assessments also grew due to an increase in assessable volumes for market development programs in specific countries within Europe. In addition, revenue growth rates in 2007 were impacted by a reclassification of $31 million from assessments to currency conversion and cross-border revenues, offset by $12 million in pricing increases related to our April 2006 SEPA pricing changes. The increase in 2007 gross assessments, excluding the impact of the reclassifications and the pricing increase, would have been 11.3%. Rebates and incentives are primarily based on GDV but may also contain components for the issuance of new cards, launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs. The rebates and incentives are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue in the same period that performance occurs. Rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments were 47.4%, 48.2% and 49.9% in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Rebates and incentives increased during 2008 and 2007 due to new and renewals of customer agreements and increased volumes for certain merchants. However, the increase in 2008 was partially offset by reductions of rebates and incentives for certain customers that did not achieve contractual performance hurdles. These reductions in rebates 56 Table of Contents and incentives decreased rebates and incentives as a percentage of gross assessments. In 2008 and 2007, rebates and incentives compared to gross assessments fluctuated with the timing and structure of pricing arrangements with certain large customers and merchants. Operating Expenses Our operating expenses are comprised of general and administrative, advertising and marketing, litigation settlements, contributions to the Foundation and depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2008, there was an increase in operating expenses of $2,567 million, or 86.7%, versus 2007. This increase was primarily due to the settlement of antitrust litigations with Discover Financial Services (“Discover” and the “Discover Settlement”) and American Express Company (“American Express” and the “American Express Settlement”). The following table compares and reconciles operating expenses, excluding litigation settlements and the 2006 stock contribution to the Foundation (“Special Items”), which is a non-GAAP financial measure, to operating expenses including Special Items, which is the most directly comparable GAAP measurement. Management uses these types of non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its ongoing operations in relation to historical results and believes this analysis may be helpful to an investor’s evaluation of ongoing operating results.

Personnel expense increased in 2007 as additional staff were added to support customer-facing, technology and product areas and due to increased personnel performance incentive accruals, as a result of better performance against company objectives. • Professional fees consist primarily of legal costs to defend our outstanding litigation and third-party consulting services related to strategic initiatives. Professional fees decreased slightly in 2008 versus 2007 primarily due to lower legal expenses. In 2007, professional fees increased versus 2006 primarily due to increased legal costs to defend outstanding litigation claims and increased consulting activity related to strategic objectives. • Telecommunications expense consists of expenses to support our global payments system infrastructure as well as our other telecommunication needs. These expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage. • Data processing consists of expenses to operate and maintain MasterCard’s computer systems. These expenses vary with business volume growth, system upgrades and usage. • Travel and entertainment expenses are incurred primarily for travel to customer and regional meetings. In 2008, these expenses decreased as a result of cost containment initiatives. In 2007, these expenses increased as a result of increased business activity. • Other includes rental expense for our facilities, foreign exchange gains and losses and other miscellaneous administrative expenses. The increase in 2008 is primarily driven by unfavorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and higher rent for office facilities. Advertising and Marketing Our brands, principally MasterCard, are valuable strategic assets that drive card acceptance and usage and facilitate our ability to successfully introduce new service offerings and access new markets globally. Our advertising and marketing strategy is to increase global MasterCard brand awareness, preference and usage through integrated advertising, sponsorship, promotional, interactive media and public relations programs on a global scale. We will also continue to invest in marketing programs at the regional and local levels and sponsor diverse events aimed at multiple target audiences. Also included within advertising and marketing are costs associated with offering cardholder benefits, such as insurance and travel assistance, for certain programs. Advertising and marketing expenses decreased $62 million, or 5.8%, and increased $28 million, or 2.7%, in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to cost containment initiatives, partially offset by approximately 2 percentage points related to the impact of foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and 58 Table of Contents Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar. The increase in advertising and marketing in 2007 was primarily due to foreign currency fluctuation of the euro and Brazilian real to the U.S. dollar. In addition, in 2008 and 2007 our advertising and marketing activities supported multiple sponsorships and the timing of certain advertising and marketing expenses varied due to their relationship to specific sponsorships or promotions. In 2006, a significant amount of our advertising and marketing activities were allocated to the sponsorship of the 2006 World Cup soccer events. During 2007, we reached an agreement to discontinue our sponsorship of the 2010 and 2014 World Cup soccer events. See Note 24 (Other Income) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of this settlement agreement. Litigation Settlements On October 27, 2008, MasterCard and Visa Inc. (“Visa”) entered into the Discover Settlement with Discover relating to the U.S. federal antitrust litigation amongst the parties. The Discover Settlement ended all litigation between the parties for a total of $2.75 billion. In July 2008, MasterCard and Visa entered into a judgment sharing agreement. In accordance with the terms of the judgment sharing agreement, MasterCard’s share of the Discover Settlement was $863 million, which was paid to Discover in November 2008. Additionally, in connection with the Discover Settlement, Morgan Stanley, Discover’s former parent company, paid MasterCard $35 million in November 2008, pursuant to a separate agreement. The net pre-tax expense of $828 million was recorded in litigation settlements, in the consolidated statement of operations, during the third quarter of 2008. On June 24, 2008, MasterCard entered into the American Express Settlement which ended all existing litigation between American Express and MasterCard. Under the terms of the American Express Settlement, beginning on September 15, 2008, MasterCard is required to pay American Express up to $150 million each quarter for 12 quarters, payable in cash on the 15th day of the last month of each quarter, for a maximum amount of $1.8 billion. The charge is based on MasterCard’s assumption that American Express will achieve certain financial performance hurdles. The quarterly payments will be in an amount equal to 15% of American Express’ United States Global Network Services billings during the quarter, up to a maximum of $150 million per quarter. If, however, the payment for any quarter is less than $150 million, the maximum payment for subsequent quarters will be increased by the difference between $150 million and the lesser amount that was paid in any quarter in which there was a shortfall. MasterCard recorded the present value of $1.8 billion, at a 5.75% discount rate, or $1.649 billion, pre-tax, in the second quarter of 2008. In the first quarter of 2003, MasterCard entered into a settlement agreement (the “U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement”) related to the U.S. merchant lawsuit described under the caption “U.S. Merchant and Consumer Litigations” in Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report and recorded a pre-tax charge of $721 million ($469 million after-tax) consisting of (i) the monetary amount of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement (discounted at 8 percent over the payment term), (ii) certain additional costs in connection with, and in order to comply with, other requirements of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement, and (iii) costs to address the merchants who opted not to participate in the plaintiff class in the U.S. merchant lawsuit. The $721 million pre-tax charge amount was an estimate, which was subsequently revised based on the approval of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement agreement by the court and other factors. 59 Table of Contents We recorded liabilities for certain litigation settlements in prior periods. Total liabilities for litigation settlements changed from December 31, 2006, as follows: (In millions) Balance as of December 31, 2006 $ 477 Provision for litigation settlements (Note 20) 3 Interest accretion on U.S. Merchant Lawsuit 38 Payments (114 ) Balance as of December 31, 2007 $ 404 Provision for Discover Settlement 863 Provision for American Express Settlement 1,649 Provision for other litigation settlements 6 Interest accretion on U.S. Merchant Lawsuit 33 Interest accretion on American Express Settlement 44 Payments on American Express Settlement (300 ) Payments on Discover Settlement (863 ) Payment on U.S. Merchant Lawsuit (100 ) Other payments and accretion (1 ) Balance as of December 31, 2008 $ 1,736 * Note that table may not sum due to rounding. Contribution Expense—Foundation In May 2006, in conjunction with our initial public offering (“IPO”), we issued 13,496,933 shares of our Class A common stock as a donation to the Foundation that is incorporated in Canada and controlled by directors who are independent of us and our customers. The Foundation builds on MasterCard’s existing charitable giving commitments by continuing to support programs and initiatives that help children and youth to access education, understand and utilize technology, and develop the skills necessary to succeed in a diverse and global work force. The vision of the Foundation is to make the economy work for everybody by advancing innovative programs in areas of microfinance and youth education. In connection with the donation of the Class A common stock, we recorded an expense of $395 million which was equal to the aggregate value of the shares we donated. In both 2007 and 2006, we recorded expenses of $20 million for cash donations we made to the Foundation, completing our intention, announced at the time of the IPO, to donate approximately $40 million in cash to the Foundation in support of its operating expenses and charitable disbursements for the first four years of its operations. We may make additional cash contributions to the Foundation in the future. The cash and stock donations to the Foundation are generally not deductible by MasterCard for tax purposes. As a result of this difference between the financial statement and tax treatments of the donations, our effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2006 is significantly higher than our effective income tax rates for 2007 and 2008. Depreciation and Amortization Depreciation and amortization expenses increased $14 million in 2008 and decreased $2 million in 2007. The increase in depreciation and amortization expense in 2008 is primarily due to increased investments in leasehold and building improvements, data center equipment and capitalized software. The decrease in depreciation and amortization expense in 2007 was primarily related to certain assets becoming fully depreciated. Depreciation and amortization will increase as we continue to invest in leasehold and building improvements, data center equipment and capitalized software. 60 Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) is comprised primarily of investment income, interest expense and other gains and losses. • Investment income decreased $348 million in 2008 and increased $405 million in 2007. The change in each period was primarily due to the timing of sales of our RedeCard S.A. investment; the Company sold 22% and 78% of its shares of common stock in RedeCard S.A, and realized gains of $86 million and $391 million, in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The decrease in investment income in 2008 was also impacted by lower dividend income of $14 million, primarily due to the sale of our RedeCard S.A. investment, and lower interest income of $30 million, primarily due to lower interest rates. • Interest expense increased $46 million in 2008 and decreased $4 million in 2007. The increase in 2008 was primarily due to interest accretion associated with the American Express Settlement of $44 million and higher interest expense on uncertain tax positions partially offset by lower interest accretion on the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement. The decrease in 2007 was primarily due to lower interest accretion related to the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement. • Other income (expense) decreased $18 million in 2008 and increased $89 million in 2007. In both years gains were recognized on settlement agreements. A $75 million gain related to the termination of a customer business agreement was recognized in 2008. A $90 million settlement gain with the organization that operates the World Cup soccer events was recognized in 2007. See Note 24 (Other Income) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional discussion. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 33.7%, 35.0% and 82.9%, respectively. The decrease in the effective income tax rate in 2008 compared to 2007 was primarily due to the impact of the charges associated with the Discover Settlement and American Express Settlement. These charges caused a change in the geographic distribution of pretax income resulting in pretax income in lower tax jurisdictions and pretax loss in higher tax jurisdictions. The resulting tax benefit of the loss was offset by a tax charge for the remeasurement of deferred tax assets as a result of a change in the Company’s state effective tax rate. As a result of the remeasurement, the Company’s deferred tax assets were reduced by $20 million and an income tax expense was recorded for the same amount. The change in the effective income tax rate in 2007 compared to 2006 primarily relates to a non-deductible charitable contribution of shares of MasterCard Class A common stock to the Foundation during 2006. MasterCard recorded a significant expense equal to the value of the Class A common stock we donated to the Foundation. Under the terms of the contribution to the Foundation, this donation is generally not deductible to MasterCard for tax purposes. The components impacting the effective income tax rates as compared to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 35.0% are as follows: For the years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 DollarAmount Percent DollarAmount Percent DollarAmount Percent (In millions, except percentages) Income (loss) before income tax expense (benefit) $ (383 ) $ 1,671 $ 294 Federal statutory tax $ (134 ) 35.0 % $ 585 35.0 % $ 103 35.0 % State tax effect, net of federal benefit 11 (2.9 ) 28 1.6 6 1.8 Non-deductible charitable stock contribution — — — — 138 47.0 Foreign tax effect, net of federal benefit 2 (0.5 ) (12 ) (0.7 ) (6 ) (1.9 ) Non-deductible expenses and other differences 2 (0.7 ) (3 ) (0.2 ) 13 4.4 Tax exempt income (10 ) 2.8 (12 ) (0.7 ) (10 ) (3.4 ) Income tax expense (benefit) $ (129 ) 33.7 % $ 586 35.0 % $ 244 82.9 % 61 Table of Contents The Company’s GAAP effective income tax rate for 2008 was significantly affected by the tax benefits related to the charges for the Discover Settlement and the American Express Settlement. The Company’s effective tax rate for 2006 was significantly affected by the $395 million charitable contribution of MasterCard Class A common stock to the Foundation. Due to the non-recurring nature of these items, the Company believes that the calculation of the 2008 effective tax rate, excluding the impacts of the Discover Settlement and American Express Settlement, and the 2006 effective tax rate, excluding the impact of the charitable stock contribution to the Foundation, will be helpful in comparing effective tax rates for 2008, 2007 and 2006.

The 2008 litigation settlements will be deductible in future periods as payments are made and are therefore considered in the calculation of non-GAAP income tax expense. 62 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources We need liquidity and access to capital to fund our global operations; to provide for credit and settlement risk; to finance capital expenditures and any future acquisitions; to service the payments of principal and interest on our outstanding debt; and to service our obligations related to litigation settlements. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $2.1 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, of cash, cash equivalents and current available-for-sale securities to use for our operations. Our stockholder’s equity was $1.9 billion and $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2008, and 2007, respectively. We believe that the cash generated from operations, our borrowing capacity and our access to capital resources are sufficient to meet our future operating capital needs, debt and litigation settlement obligations. Our liquidity and access to capital could be negatively impacted by the adverse outcome of any of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are still a party. See Item 1A, Note 18 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report and “-Business Environment Challenges” in Item 7 of this Report for additional discussion of these and other risks facing our business. 2008 2007 2006 Percent Increase (Decrease) 2008 2007 (In millions, except percentages) Cash Flow Data: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 413 $ 770 $ 650 (46.3 )% 18.4 % Net cash provided by (used in) investing activities 202 315 (676 ) (36.0 )% 146.6 % Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (751 ) (658 ) 638 14.3 % (203.1 )% Balance Sheet Data: Current assets $ 4,312 $ 4,592 $ 3,577 (6.1 )% 28.4 % Current liabilities 2,990 2,363 1,812 26.5 % 30.5 % Long-term liabilities 1,553 865 902 79.6 % (4.1 )% Stockholder’s equity 1,927 3,027 2,364 (36.3 )% 28.0 % Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $413 million, compared to $770 million and $650 million in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The decrease in cash from operations in 2008 was primarily due to a $1.1 billion increase in litigation settlement payments as a result of the Discover Settlement and American Express Settlement, offset by higher net revenues. The increase in cash from operations in 2007 versus 2006 was primarily due to higher net income less the realized pre-tax gain on RedeCard S.A. common stock, which is classified as an investing activity, partially offset by higher income tax payments, including approximately $137 million for taxes relating to the realized gain on RedeCard S.A. common stock. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2008 primarily related to net sales of available-for-sale securities, partially offset by payments for capitalized software to expand our core functionality, including continued development of a debit and prepaid processing platform, acquisition of a business, and leasehold and building improvements to support increased workforce and data center equipment. We intend to continue to invest in our infrastructure to support our growing business and strategic initiatives. Net cash provided by investing activities in 2007 primarily related to net sales of available-for-sale securities, including the sale of a significant portion of our shares of Redecard S.A. common stock, partially offset by cash used for investments in leasehold and building improvements to support increased workforce, data center equipment and capitalized software to expand our core functionality, including development of a new debit and prepaid processing platform. Net cash used for investing activities in 2006 was primarily due to net purchases of available-for-sale-securities as a result of the additional funds from the IPO proceeds and our investment in capitalized software to support our growing business and strategic initiatives. Cash used in financing activities in 2008 primarily related to the repurchase of approximately 2.8 million shares of our Class A common stock through a share repurchase plan, the payment of approximately $80 million in quarterly dividends to our stockholders and the repayment of $80 million related to the Company’s ten-year 63 Table of Contents unsecured, subordinated notes that matured in June 2008. See Note 13 (Debt) and Note 14 (Stockholders’ Equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our debt repayment and stock repurchase plan, respectively. Cash used in financing activities in 2007 primarily related to the repurchase of approximately $601 million of our Class A common stock through a repurchase plan and payment of $74 million in dividends to our shareholders. The net cash provided by financing activities in 2006 primarily related to the proceeds received from the sale of Class A common stock to investors in the IPO (including the proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) of approximately $2.5 billion, partially offset by $1.8 billion for the redemption of Class B common stock and a $12 million dividend payment. On October 27, 2008, MasterCard and Visa entered into the Discover Settlement relating to the U.S. federal antitrust litigation amongst the parties. In connection with the Discover Settlement, MasterCard was required to pay $863 million to Discover and received $35 million from Morgan Stanley, Discover’s former parent company, in November 2008. Also, on June 24, 2008, MasterCard entered into the American Express Settlement. Under its terms, beginning on September 15, 2008, MasterCard is required to pay American Express up to $150 million each quarter for 12 quarters, payable in cash on the 15th day of the last month of each quarter, for a maximum amount of $1.8 billion. In 2003, MasterCard entered into the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement. Under the terms of the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement, the Company is required to pay $100 million annually each December through the year 2012. See Note 18 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and Note 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information on these litigation settlements. As of December 31, 2008, the Company held $192 million of auction rate securities (“ARS”) classified as long-term available-for-sale securities. As of December 31, 2007, the Company held $348 million of ARS classified as current available-for-sale securities. This change in classification is due to failure of the auction mechanism and a continued lack of liquidity in the ARS market. The stated maturity of the securities ranges from 10 to 33 years, and the securities are collateralized by student loans with guarantees, ranging from approximately 95% to 98% of principal and interest, by the U.S. government, via the Department of Education. We determined that the fair value of the ARS does not approximate par value, assigned a 20% discount to the par value of the ARS portfolio and recorded a temporary impairment within other comprehensive income during 2008. We have the intent and ability to hold the ARS until recovery of fair value, which may be maturity or earlier if called or if liquidity is restored in the market. See Note 4 (Investment Securities) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information. On December 2, 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable on February 10, 2009 to holders of record on January 9, 2009 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount payable for this dividend was $20 million as of December 31, 2008. On February 3, 2009, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.15 per share payable on May 8, 2009 to holders of record on April 13, 2009 of our Class A common stock and Class B common stock. The aggregate amount needed for this dividend is estimated to be $20 million. The declaration and payment of future dividends will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors after taking into account various factors, including our financial condition, settlement guarantees, operating results, available cash and anticipated cash needs. On August 29, 2008, MasterCard notified the equity investor and holders of secured notes related to its variable interest entity (the “Trust”) of its intent to repay the equity investor and the obligations issued through the Trust. The repayment of aggregate outstanding principal and accrued interest on the secured notes, and repayment of the equity investor and make-whole payment, is expected to occur in March 2009 for a total amount of $165 million. MasterCard was in compliance with the covenants of the secured notes at December 31, 2008. See Note 15 (Consolidation of Variable Interest Entity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. 64 Table of Contents On January 22, 2009, Standard & Poor’s reaffirmed our BBB+ long-term and A-2 short-term counterparty credit ratings, with a stable outlook. Our access to capital and liquidity has been sufficient with these ratings. A securities rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time. On April 28, 2008, the Company extended its committed unsecured revolving credit facility, dated as of April 28, 2006 (the “Credit Facility”), for an additional year. The new expiration date of the Credit Facility is April 26, 2011. The available funding under the Credit Facility will remain at $2.5 billion through April 27, 2010 and then decrease to $2.0 billion during the final year of the Credit Facility agreement. Other terms and conditions in the Credit Facility remain unchanged. The Company’s option to request that each lender under the Credit Facility extend its commitment was provided pursuant to the original terms of the Credit Facility agreement. MasterCard was in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facility and had no borrowings under the Credit Facility at December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, respectively. The majority of Credit Facility lenders are customers or affiliates of customers of MasterCard International. On January 5, 2009, HSBC Bank plc (“HSBC”) notified the Company that, effective December 31, 2008, it had terminated an uncommitted credit agreement totaling 100 million euros between HSBC and MasterCard Europe sprl. There were no outstanding borrowings under this facility at December 31, 2008. In June 2007, the Company’s stockholders approved amendments to the Company’s certificate of incorporation designed to facilitate an accelerated, orderly conversion of Class B common stock into Class A common stock for subsequent sale. In February 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the conversion and sale or transfer of up to 13.1 million shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock. In May 2008, the Company implemented and completed a conversion program in which all of the 13.1 million authorized shares of Class B common stock were converted into an equal number of Class A common stock and subsequently sold or transferred by participating holders of Class B common stock to public investors. In February 2009, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the conversion and sale or transfer of up to 11.0 million shares of Class B common stock into Class A common stock in one or more conversion programs during 2009. See Note 14 (Stockholders’ Equity) to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Future Obligations The following table summarizes our obligations as of December 31, 2008 that are expected to impact liquidity and cash flow in future periods. We believe we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and our existing cash balances. Payments Due by Period Total 2009 2010-2011 2012-2013 2014 andthereafter (In millions) Capital leases1 $ 52 $ 8 $ 5 $ 39 $ — Operating leases2 106 40 30 16 19 Sponsorship, licensing and other3,4 570 337 187 45 2 Litigation settlements5 1,912 712 1,100 100 — Debt6 184 165 19 — — Total $ 2,824 $ 1,262 $ 1,341 $ 200 $ 21 * Note that totals in above table may not sum due to rounding. 1 Most capital leases relate to certain property, plant and equipment used in our business. Our largest capital lease relates to our Kansas City, Missouri co-processing facility. 2 We enter into operating leases in the normal course of business, including the lease on our facility in St. Louis, Missouri. Substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time. 65 Table of Contents Some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property. Our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional lease agreements. 3 Amounts primarily relate to sponsorships with certain organizations to promote the MasterCard brand. The amounts included are fixed and non-cancelable. In addition, these amounts include amounts due in accordance with merchant agreements for future marketing, computer hardware maintenance, software licenses and other service agreements. Future cash payments that will become due to our customers under agreements which provide pricing rebates on our standard fees and other incentives in exchange for increased transaction volumes are not included in the table because the amounts due are indeterminable and contingent until such time as performance has occurred. MasterCard has accrued $527 million as of December 31, 2008 related to customer and merchant agreements. 4 We have included our current liability of $13 million relating to Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes” (“FIN 48”). Due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of the non-current FIN 48 liabilities, we are unable to make reasonable estimates of the period of cash settlements with the respective taxing authority. 5 Represents amounts due in accordance with the Discover Settlement, American Express Settlement, U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement and other litigation settlements. 6 Debt primarily represents principal owed on our Series A Senior Secured Notes, which are expected to be paid in March 2009, and amounts due for the acquisition of MasterCard France. See Notes 13 (Debt) and 3 (Supplemental Cash Flows), respectively, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for further discussion on these matters. We also have various credit facilities for which there were no outstanding balances at December 31, 2008 that, among other things, would provide liquidity in the event of settlement failures by our members. Our debt obligations would change if one or more of our members failed and we borrowed under these credit facilities to settle on our members’ behalf or for other reasons. Seasonality Our revenues are contingent upon the underlying metrics on which the revenues are calculated. Gross revenues in the fourth quarter of 2008 were negatively impacted by lower purchase volumes and transactions due to the economic crisis. In response, MasterCard accelerated its cost savings initiatives in the quarter, with particular focus on advertising, personnel and travel expenses. Historically, during the fourth quarter, our quarterly gross revenues have been positively impacted by increases in purchase volume related to the holiday shopping period, with offsetting increases resulting from higher rebates and incentives to our customers. Also, operating expenses have historically been higher in the fourth quarter due to additional advertising and promotions related to the holiday period and increases in personnel incentives for exceeding the Company’s objectives. The economic environment in 2008 caused our operating results to diverge from these historical trends. 66 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Estimates Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition. We are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. We have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period. The following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments. Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Asset Impairment Analyses Investments The Company invests in certain short-term and long-term assets, including municipal bonds, bond funds and ARS. The Company’s investment strategy for these assets is to ensure capital preservation while capturing some interest return on the invested funds. The Company performs on-going evaluations of its investments to assess potential impairment. Impairment of the Company’s investments in municipal bonds is assessed based on market prices of similar assets, as provided by custodians of such assets. Impairment of the Company’s short-term bond funds is assessed based on quoted prices for these assets, as they are actively traded on a daily basis. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to additional impairment charges associated with our investments. The fair value of our available-for-sale investment portfolio was $780 million as of December 31, 2008, which included $36 million of net unrealized losses. The primary analysis tool used to assess impairment of the Company’s ARS investments is a discounted cash flow model. This model considers the original economic life of the asset, the relevant cash flows expected over the life of the asset, an appropriate discount rate and other factors that may be relevant. The present value of the expected future cash flows is calculated and compared to the carrying value to determine if an impairment has occurred and, if so, what is the expected duration of the impairment. Prepaid Customer and Merchant Incentives We prepay certain customer and merchant business incentives to incent usage and acceptance of our cards. In the event of customer or merchant business failure, these incentives may not have future economic benefits for our business. The evaluation of recoverability of prepaid customer and merchant incentives is done whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If events or changes in circumstances occur that we are not aware of, additional impairment charges related to our prepaid customer and merchant incentives may be incurred. The carrying value of prepaid customer and merchant incentives was $398 at December 31, 2008. 67 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Goodwill and Intangible Assets (excluding Capitalized Software) We perform analyses of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist. This evaluation utilizes a two-step approach. The first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss, if any. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over fair value. The test methods employed in performing the analyses involve assumptions concerning interest and discount rates, growth projections and other assumptions of future business conditions. The assumptions employed are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data. We utilize independent valuation experts, if needed. If actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates, we may be exposed to an additional impairment charge associated with goodwill and/or intangible assets. The carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets, excluding capitalized software, was $527 million, including $206 million of unamortizable customer relationships, as of December 31, 2008. We determined that the majority of our customer relationships, which are intangible assets, have indefinite lives. In addition to the impairment testing noted above, we assess the appropriateness of that indefinite life annually. We completed our annual impairment testing for all goodwill and other intangibles using the methodology described herein, and no impairment charges were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2008. Capitalized Software Our capitalized software, which includes internal and external costs incurred in developing or obtaining computer software for internal use, is included in other intangible assets. We are required to make judgments to determine if each project will satisfy its intended use. In addition, we estimate the average internal costs incurred for payroll and payroll related expenses by department for the employees who directly devote time relating to the design, development and testing phases of the project. If actual results are not consistent with our judgments, we may be exposed to an impairment charge. The net carrying value of capitalized software as of December 31, 2008 was $166 million. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate whether there are any events that indicate impairment of our various technologies. During the year ended December 31, 2008, no significant impairment charges were recorded. Revenue Recognition Our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly GDV or GEV are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers’ performance. Total net assessment revenues included an estimate as of the end of the period for 25%, 26% and 26% of those net Our assessment revenues that are based on quarterly GDV or GEV are recorded utilizing an estimate of our customers’ performance. Such estimates are subsequently validated against performance reported by our customers. If our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Historically, our estimates have differed from the actual 68 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions assessment revenues, representing 6%, 7% and 7% of total net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our revenue recognition policies are fully described in Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report. Differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports. Customers’ performance is estimated by using historical performance, customer reported information, transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers. performance by less than 5% of the estimates on a quarterly basis. Rebates and incentives are estimated. Rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra-revenue based on our estimate of each customer’s performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements. If our customers’ actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance, contra-revenues may be materially different than initially recorded. Legal and Regulatory Matters Legal Proceedings We are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. Except as described in Notes 18 (Obligations Under Litigation Settlements) and 20 (Legal and Regulatory Proceedings) to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report, MasterCard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects. We evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party in accordance with SFAS No. 5, “Accounting for Contingencies” (“SFAS No. 5”). Our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the merits of our defenses and consultation with in-house and outside legal counsel. Due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate, our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes. Discount Rates for Litigation Settlements We have discounted two litigation settlements over their respective payment terms. The U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement was discounted at 8% over the ten-year payment term. We estimated the discount rate used to calculate the present value of our obligations under litigation settlements. The discount rate is a matter of management judgment at the time of each settlement, which considers our expected post-settlement credit rating and rates for sources of credit that could be used to finance the payment of such obligations with similar terms. For the U.S. Merchant Lawsuit Settlement, a one percent increase in the discount rate would have increased annual interest expense in 2008 by approximately $3 million, and declining amounts thereafter. The reverse impact would be experienced for a one percent decrease in such discount rate. 69 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions The American Express Settlement was discounted at 5.75% over the three-year payment term. For the American Express Settlement, a one percent increase in the discount rate would have decreased the litigation settlement expense for 2008 by approximately $24 million. A one percent decrease in the discount rate would produce the opposite impact. For the American Express Settlement, a one percent increase in the discount rate would have increased interest expense for 2008 by approximately $7 million. A one percent decrease in the discount rate would produce the opposite impact. Income Taxes In calculating our effective tax rate, we need to make decisions regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We have various tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions, establishment of reserves for credits and audit matters and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. Although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable, actual results may differ by a material amount. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. We considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance. If we realize a deferred tax asset subject to a valuation allowance in excess of the deferred tax asset net of that valuation allowance or if we were unable to realize such a net deferred tax asset; an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase or decrease earnings, respectively, in the period. We record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or to be taken on tax returns that may not be sustained or would only partially be sustained, upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities. We considered all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether an uncertain tax position was more likely than not to be sustained. If upon examination, we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained this would decrease or increase earnings, in the period. In certain situations, the Company will have offsetting tax deductions or tax credits. We do not record U.S. income tax expense for foreign earnings which we plan to reinvest to expand our international operations. We considered business plans, planning opportunities, and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations. If our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations, additional U.S. income tax expense would have to be recorded which would increase our effective tax rate in that period. 70 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Pensions and Postretirement Benefit Plans The Company maintains a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan with a cash balance feature covering substantially all of its U.S. employees hired before July 1, 2007. This pension plan credits participants annually with an amount equal to a fixed percentage of eligible pay based on age and service, as well as providing earnings credits based on each participant’s account balance. Additionally, the Company has an unfunded nonqualified supplemental executive retirement plan that provides certain key employees with supplemental retirement benefits in excess of limits imposed on qualified plans by U.S. tax laws. The Company also maintains a postretirement plan providing health coverage and life insurance benefits for most of its U.S. employees and retirees. Company management representing the functional areas of compensation, benefits, treasury and finance review and approve on an annual basis assumptions used in the determination of the annual costs for our pension and postretirement plans and the disclosure of the funded position of our plans. Key assumptions include the discount rate used to measure each of the plans’ projected benefit obligations for pension and postretirement, the expected rate of return on pension plan assets and the health care cost trend rate for our postretirement plan. The discount rates for the Company’s pension and postretirement plans are subject to change each year, consistent with changes in high-quality, long-term corporate bond markets. To select a discount rate for each plan, we performed an analysis which matched the plans expected cash flows (determined on PBO basis) with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high-grade non-callable corporate bonds and arithmetically rounded this result. For the pension plan, our discount rate of 6.00% as of December 31, 2008 is equal to the 6.00% rate used in calculating the projected benefit obligation for 2007. For the postretirement plan, our discount rate of 6.00% as of December 31, 2008 is 25 basis points less than the 6.25% rate used in calculating the projected benefit obligation for 2007. Net actuarial gains and/or losses in our benefit plans are amortized on straight-line basis over the expected average remaining service of active participants expected to benefit under the plans. We determine the expected return on plan assets primarily based on long-term historical returns in equity and fixed income markets. The expected rate of return on our pension plan assets is 8.00% for the year ended December 31, 2008 and 8.50% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006. The Company reviews external data and its own historical trends to determine the health care trend rates for postretirement medical costs. A quarter of a percentage point decrease in our discount rate would increase our pension projected benefit obligation by $0.9 million, and increase our postretirement projected benefit obligation by $2.3 million. These decreases would have a negligible effect on our annual pension and postretirement expense. An approximately equal, but opposite effect would be experienced for a quarter of a percentage point increase in the discount rate. A quarter of a percentage point increase or decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase the annual pension costs by $0.4 million. 71 Table of Contents Financial Statement Caption/Critical Accounting Estimate Assumptions/Approach Used Effect if Actual Results Differfrom Assumptions Postemployment Benefit Plan We have a formal severance plan which sets forth the guidelines with respect to severance payments to salaried employees whose normal assignment is within the United States. Approximately 3,600 of our employees are covered by the Plan. Severance benefits are determined primarily by years of service and career level in accordance with either a standard or enhanced payment schedule, which is determined by the cause of the severance action. The Company has a severance plan committee with members from different functional responsibilities, including human resources, legal and finance, that review and approve assumptions used in the determination of the liability for expected future severance obligations. Key assumptions include the number of severed participants, number of severed individuals by career level, benefit package and discount rate. The assumption for the number of severed participants used in the calculation was 100, 100 and 120 for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The career levels for these individuals was estimated using historical experience as a base, adjusted for a number of strategic and human resource initiatives implemented during these years and current employment levels. We review historical trends and future expectations when determining the assumptions. The discount rate for our postemployment plan is subject to change each year, consistent with changes in high-quality, long-term corporate bond markets. To select a discount rate, we performed an analysis which matched the plans expected cash flows with spot rates developed from a yield curve comprised of high-grade non-callable corporate bonds and arithmetically rounded this result. Our discount rate of 5.75% as of December 31, 2008 is 25 basis points higher than the rate used in calculating the severance obligations for 2007, which was 5.5%. A 5% increase in the number of severed participants would increase our severance obligations by $1.6 million. An equal but opposite effect would be experienced for a 5% decrease in the number of participants. A quarter of a percentage point decrease or increase in our discount rate would have an impact of approximately $0.4 million on our severance obligations. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), “Business Combinations” (“SFAS 141R”) which replaces SFAS No. 141, “Business Combinations”. SFAS 141R establishes the principles and requirements for how an acquirer: 1) recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest in the acquiree; 2) recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase; and 3) discloses the business combination. SFAS 141R applies to all transactions in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses, including transactions that occur without the transfer of any type of consideration. SFAS 141R is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations on or after January 1, 2009, with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies. Early adoption is not allowed. The Company will adopt SFAS 141R on January 1, 2009 and its effect on future periods will be dependent upon the nature and significance of any acquisitions subject to this statement. 72 Table of Contents In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, “Noncontrolling Interests in consolidated financial statements—an amendment of ARB No. 51” (“SFAS 160”). SFAS 160 amends ARB No. 51 “Consolidated Financial Statements” and establishes accounting and reporting standards that require non-controlling interests (previously referred to as minority interests) to be reported as a component of equity. In addition, changes in a parent’s ownership interest while the parent retains its controlling interest are accounted for as equity transactions, and upon a loss of control, retained ownership interests are remeasured at fair value, with any gain or loss recognized in earnings. SFAS 160 is effective for the Company on January 1, 2009, except for the presentation and disclosure requirements, which will be applied retrospectively. Early adoption is not allowed. The Company does not expect that the adoption of SFAS 160 will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. In February 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position 157-2 (“FSP 157-2”). FSP 157-2 permits delayed adoption of SFAS 157 for certain non-financial assets and liabilities, which are not recognized at fair value on a recurring basis, until fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. As permitted by FSP 157-2, the Company has elected to delay the adoption of SFAS 157 for qualifying non-financial assets and liabilities, such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. The Company does not believe the adoption of SFAS 157 for its non-financial assets and liabilities, that are not recognized at fair value on a recurring basis, will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, “Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133” (“SFAS 161”). SFAS 161 requires enhanced disclosures about an entity’s derivative and hedging activities in an effort to improve the transparency of financial reporting and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after November 15, 2008. SFAS 161 will not impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position as its requirements are disclosure-only in nature. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position Emerging Issues Task Force 03-6-1, “Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share-Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities” (“FSP EITF 03-6-1”). FSP EITF 03-6-1 requires entities to allocate earnings to unvested and contingently issuable share-based payment awards that have non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents when calculating EPS and also present both basic EPS and diluted EPS pursuant to the two-class method described in SFAS No. 128, “Earnings per Share”. FSP EITF 03-6-1 is effective January 1, 2009 and requires retrospective application. The Company will adopt FSP EITF 03-6-1 during 2009 and is not able to project its impact on future presentations of EPS due to the inherent complexities associated with projecting future financial performance. The Company’s calculation of the expected impact of FSP EITF 03-6-1 on EPS for the years ended December 31 is as follows: 2008 2007 Earnings (Loss) per Share: Basic—as originally reported $ (1.95 ) $ 8.05 Basic—impact of EITF 03-6-1 0.01 (0.07 ) Basic—as will be reported in 2009 $ (1.94 ) $ 7.98 Diluted—as originally reported $ (1.95 ) $ 8.00 Diluted—impact of EITF 03-6-1 0.01 (0.04 ) Diluted—as will be reported in 2009 $ (1.94 ) $ 7.96 In December 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position 132(R)-1, “Employers’ Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets” (“FSP SFAS 132R-1”). FSP SFAS 132R-1 provides guidance on an employer’s disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension plan or other postretirement plan, including disclosure of how investment allocation decisions are made, major categories of plan assets, inputs and valuation techniques used to 73 Table of Contents measure the fair value of plan assets and concentrations of credit risk. FSP SFAS 132R-1 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. FSP SFAS 132R-1 will not impact the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position as its requirements are disclosure-only in nature. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Market risk is the potential for economic losses to be incurred on market risk sensitive instruments arising from adverse changes in market factors such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and equity price risk. We have limited exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates and equity price risk. Management establishes and oversees the implementation of policies, which have been approved by the Board of Directors, governing our funding, investments and use of derivative financial instruments. We monitor risk exposures on an ongoing basis. There were no material changes in our market risk exposures at December 31, 2008 as compared to December 31, 2007. Foreign Exchange Risk We enter into forward exchange contracts to minimize risk associated with anticipated receipts and disbursements which are either transacted in a non-functional currency or valued based on a currency other than our functional currencies. We also enter into contracts to offset possible changes in value due to foreign exchange fluctuations of assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. The objective of this activity is to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses resulting from fluctuations of foreign currencies against our functional currencies, principally the U.S. dollar and euro. The terms of the forward currency contracts are generally less than 18 months. U.S. Dollar Functional Currency (In millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Notional EstimatedFair Value Notional EstimatedFair Value Commitments to purchase foreign currency $293 $22 $40 $— Commitments to sell foreign currency 154 12 22 — Euro Functional Currency (In millions) December 31, 2008 December 31, 2007 Notional EstimatedFair Value Notional EstimatedFair Value Commitments to sell foreign currency $66 $— $50 $— Our settlement activities are subject to foreign exchange risk resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations. This risk is limited to the typical one business day timeframe between setting the foreign exchange rates and clearing the financial transactions and by confining the supported settlement currencies to the U.S. dollar or one of 16 other transaction currencies. The remaining 143 transaction currencies are settled in one of the supported settlement currencies or require local settlement netting arrangements that minimize our foreign exchange exposure. 74 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Our interest rate sensitive assets are our debt instruments, which we hold as available-for-sale investments. With respect to fixed maturities, our general policy is to invest in high quality securities, while providing adequate liquidity and maintaining diversification to avoid significant exposure. The fair value and maturity distribution of the Company’s available for sale investments as of December 31 was as follows: Maturity (In millions) Financial Instrument Summary Terms Fair MarketValue atDecember 31,2008 NoContractualMaturity 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 andthereafter Municipal bonds fixed interest $ 485 $ — $ 16 $ 68 $ 112 $ 101 $ 89 $ 98 Short-term bond funds fixed/variableinterest 103 103 — — — — — — Auction rate securities variable interest 192 — — — — — — 192 Other — — — — — — — — Total $ 780 $ 103 $ 16 $ 68 $ 112 $ 101 $ 89 $ 290 Maturity (In millions) Financial Instrument Summary Terms Fair MarketValue atDecember 31,2007 NoContractualMaturity 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 andthereafter Municipal bonds fixed interest $ 555 $ — $ 14 $ 61 $ 122 $ 134 $ 103 $ 120 Short-term bond funds fixed/variableinterest 306 306 — — — — — — Auction rate securities variable interest 348 — — — — — — 348 Other 99 99 — — — — — — Total $ 1,308 $ 405 $ 14 $ 61 $ 122 $ 134 $ 103 $ 468 * Note that amounts in the above table may not sum due to rounding At December 31, 2008, we had various credit facilities to provide liquidity in the event of material member settlement failures, settlement service operations and other operational needs. These credit facilities have variable rates, which are applied to the borrowing based on terms and conditions set forth in each agreement. We had no material borrowings at December 31, 2008 or 2007. See Note 13 (Debt) to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. In addition, as of December 31, 2008, we had a 7.36% fixed short-term secured note for $149 million with a fair value of $155 million relating to the Company’s Variable Interest Entity, see Note 15 (Consolidation of Variable Interest Entity) to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Report for additional information. Equity Price Risk The Company did not have significant equity price risk as of December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2007, MasterCard’s investment in shares of Redecard S.A. common stock, which was classified as an available-for-sale security was subject to equity price risk. At December 31, 2007, the effect of a hypothetical 10 percent decline in market value would have been approximately $10 million. 75 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 16:53:07.181190
