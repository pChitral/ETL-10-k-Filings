1571949,ICE,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.",2014,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading ""Forward Looking Statements"" at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Item 1(A) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in Item 6 “Selected Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We are a leading global network of regulated exchanges and clearing houses for financial and commodity markets. We operate 17 global exchanges and six central clearing houses. We operate global marketplaces for trading and clearing a broad array of securities and derivatives contracts across major asset classes, including interest rates, equities, equity derivatives, credit derivatives, bonds, currency, and commodities. On November 13, 2013, we completed our acquisition of NYSE Euronext and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date. Our business is conducted as a single reportable business 47segment, and substantially all of our identifiable assets are located in the United States, the United Kingdom, Continental Europe and Canada.Recent Developments NYSE Euronext AcquisitionOn November 13, 2013, we completed our acquisition of 100% of NYSE Euronext for a combination of $11.1 billion in cash and stock. The $2.7 billion cash consideration was funded from cash on hand, $1.4 billion of net proceeds received in October 2013 in connection with ICE Group's offering of Senior Notes (as defined below) and $400 million of borrowings under our Revolving Facility (as defined below). See “- Debt” below. Each issued and outstanding share of NYSE Euronext common stock (except for excluded shares) was converted into the right to receive 0.1703 of a share of our common stock and $11.27 in cash (this is referred to as the “standard election amount”). In lieu of the standard election amount, NYSE Euronext stockholders also had the right to make either a cash election to receive $33.12 in cash (“cash election”), or a stock election to receive 0.2581 of a share of our common stock (“stock election”), for their NYSE Euronext shares. Both the cash election and the stock election were subject to the proration and adjustment procedures set forth in the Amended and Restated Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of March 19, 2013, or the Merger Agreement, to ensure that the total amount of cash paid and stock issued were equal to the standard election amount. Because the stock consideration was substantially oversubscribed, the consideration received by the holders who elected the stock consideration was prorated pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, which resulted in the payment, under the stock election, of 0.171200756 of a share of ICE Group common stock and $11.154424 in cash for each issued and outstanding share of NYSE Euronext common stock. We issued an aggregate 42.4 million shares of our common stock in connection with the acquisition. The acquisition has been accounted for as a purchase business combination with ICE considered the acquirer of NYSE Euronext for accounting purposes. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of November 13, 2013. The excess of the purchase price over the preliminary net tangible and identifiable intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Refer to notes 3 and 7 to our consolidation financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on this acquisition.Planned Initial Public Offering of EuronextAs part of the NYSE Euronext integration, we expect to separate the businesses of Euronext and NYSE Liffe and to transition all of NYSE Liffe’s business to ICE futures exchanges, clearing houses and trading platforms. We plan to establish Euronext as an independent business and to pursue an initial public offering, or IPO, of Euronext, which is currently expected in the second quarter of 2014. We expect to use the net proceeds of the planned IPO of Euronext to pay down certain of our outstanding debt.The separation of the NYSE Liffe and Euronext businesses is subject to certain regulatory approvals by the Euronext College of Regulators, the Dutch Ministry of Finance and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority. After the separation of the NYSE Liffe business, Euronext will be established with a new legal and operating structure, and will operate Euronext cash markets with the relevant listings, index, commodity, derivatives, data and technology businesses in Amsterdam, Brussels, London, Lisbon and Paris and Euronext continental derivatives markets. In October 2013, Euronext agreed to new clearing terms with LCH.Clearnet under which Euronext will have certain governance rights and participate in certain of the clearing economics under a new revenue sharing agreement, which is set to begin in April 2014. Euronext's business will include Interbolsa, the Portuguese central securities depository, Securities Settlement System and Numbering Agency. Euronext is expected to either own or have fully paid license rights to all relevant intellectual property, technology, market data and index licenses required to operate and develop its markets and service markets of its partners and expects to continue to develop the Universal Trading Platform and surrounding systems. Euronext's business will also include certain commercial technology and exchange solutions that were formerly part of NYSE Technologies, which will allow it to provide platform services to exchanges outside of the Euronext group. We will continue to have regulatory obligations and undertakings with respect to Euronext after its planned separation and IPO and separation until our ownership level decreases to a point at which we will not be deemed to control Euronext. As part of the IPO, we may be required to maintain an ongoing ownership stake in Euronext for a period of time unless long-term shareholders are identified and approved by the Euronext College of Regulators.NYSE Technologies Planned DivestitureNYSE Euronext operates a commercial technology business, NYSE Technologies, which provides comprehensive transaction, data and infrastructure services and managed solutions for buy-side, sell-side and exchange communities. NYSE Technologies 48operates five businesses: Global Market Data, Global Connectivity, Exchange Solutions, Trading Solutions and Transaction Services. We plan to integrate the Global Market Data and Global Connectivity businesses into our broader global trading markets and remain part of our exchange operations and technology infrastructure. Global Market Data offers a broad array of global market information products covering multiple asset classes while Global Connectivity offers a financial transaction network called Secure Financial Transaction Infrastructure, or SFTI, which connects firms and exchanges worldwide. The Exchange Solutions business, which provides multi-asset exchange platform services, managed services and expert consultancy, is expected to be transferred to Euronext as part of the planned IPO.We expect to divest NYSE Technologies' two remaining business lines, Trading Solutions and Transaction Services, during 2014. The divestiture could include the sale of the business lines as a whole or in parts. We expect to use the net proceeds of the planned NYSE Technology divestiture to pay down certain of our outstanding debt. Trading Solutions and Transaction Services primarily consist of the NYFIX, Wombat and Metabit technologies. NYFIX is a leading provider of FIX-based electronic trading technologies and includes the FIX Marketplace and Appia Business Suite. Wombat is a leading market data distribution platform, developing technology and supporting services for direct access to real-time global market data. Metabit is a Tokyo-based technology service offering proprietary market access products across Asia.Other AcquisitionsIn March 2013, we acquired 79% of the derivatives and spot business of the energy exchange formerly known as APX-ENDEX. We renamed the acquired business ICE Endex and it is based on the derivatives and spot gas business of the former APX-ENDEX. The trade execution and clearing of ICE Endex derivatives products transitioned to our trading platform and to ICE Clear Europe. Gasunie, a European natural gas infrastructure company and a former stockholder of APX-ENDEX, retained the remaining 21% stake. On February 3, 2014, we acquired 100% of Singapore Mercantile Exchange Pte. Ltd., or SMX. The acquisition includes Singapore Mercantile Exchange Clearing Corporation Pte. Ltd., or SMXCC, a wholly owned subsidiary of SMX, and the clearing house for all SMX trades. SMX operates futures markets in Singapore across metals, currencies, energy and agricultural commodities. SMX and SMXCC retain licenses to operate as an approved exchange and an approved clearing house, regulated by the Monetary Authority of Singapore, providing us with exchange and clearing infrastructure in Asia for the first time. Restricted Cash and InvestmentsWe classify all cash and cash equivalents that are not available for general use by us, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2013, we have $438 million in total restricted cash and investments on our consolidated balance sheet, which includes $160 million that has been contributed to certain of our clearing houses and is to be used in the event of a default and $275 million that relates to regulatory capital that must be maintained at our regulated exchanges and clearing houses. Refer to note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on our restricted cash and investments balances.In February 2013, the final European Commission Delegated Regulations supplementing the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, or EMIR, were issued, detailing the capital requirements for central counterparties. The regulations impose capital and liquid resource requirements in excess of the Bank of England requirements for our U.K. clearing houses. Once these regulations become effective in 2014, the Bank of England restricted cash capital requirements for ICE Clear Europe will be superseded by the EMIR capital requirements, which would require an estimated increase in the liquid regulatory capital requirements ranging from $140 million to $150 million. This increase will be satisfied by way of additional restricted cash through our cash on hand. In connection with ICE Clear U.S.’s recognition as a third party Qualified Central Counter Party, or QCCP, we contributed $50 million to ICE Clear U.S.’s guaranty fund on January 1, 2014. See Item 1 “Business - Regulation” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of this requirement. Of the $50 million contribution, which will be included in long-term restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheet, $25 million will be available in the event a clearing member defaults and ICE Clear U.S. has utilized all such clearing member’s other default resources to settle the position. This amount will then be used to settle the position before other funds in the guaranty fund are used. If additional cash is still required to settle the positions, then the remaining $25 million of our contribution will be utilized pro-rata along with the other non-defaulting ICE Clear U.S. clearing members’ deposits in the guaranty fund. Refer to note 11 to our consolidation financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on our clearing houses.Consolidated Financial Highlights The following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts): 49 Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change 2012 2011 ChangeTotal revenues, less transaction-based expenses $1,674 $1,363 23 % $1,363 $1,327 3 %Total operating expenses $884 $536 65 % $536 $534 — %Operating income $790 $827 (4)% $827 $793 4 %Operating margin 47% 61% (14 pts) 61% 60% 1 ptOther expense, net $290 $37 677 % $37 $33 13 %Income tax expense $230 $228 1 % $228 $238 (4)%Effective tax rate 46% 29% 17 pts 29% 31% (2 pts)Net income attributable to ICE Group $254 $552 (54)% $552 $510 8 %Adjusted net income attributable to ICE Group$646 $557 16 % $557 $516 8 %Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE Group common shareholders $3.21 $7.52 (57)% $7.52 $6.90 9 %Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE Group common shareholders$8.17 $7.60 8 % $7.60 $6.98 9 %Cash flows from operating activities $735 $733 — % $733 $713 3 %•Consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $311 million, or 23%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to $284 million in revenues, less transaction-based expenses, recognized from NYSE Euronext subsequent to its acquisition on November 13, 2013, higher trading volume in our global oil contracts, including the ICE Brent Crude oil, WTI Crude oil and global oil and refined contracts, and increases in our market data fees and other revenues, partially offset by lower trading volume in our North American natural gas futures and options contracts. Consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $36 million, or 3%, for the year ended December 31, 2012, from the comparable period in 2011, primarily due to higher trading volume in the ICE Brent Crude oil futures and options contract, fee increases relating to our agricultural commodity futures and options contracts, and fee increases for various market data services. See “- Consolidated Revenues” below.•Consolidated operating expenses increased $348 million, or 65%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to $182 million in expenses recognized from NYSE Euronext subsequent to its acquisition on November 13, 2013 (excluding the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below) and due to the following (See “- Consolidated Operating Expenses” below): •Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs increased $146 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, due to acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relating to our acquisition of NYSE Euronext.•Rent and occupancy expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, due to $7 million in duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs relating to the consolidation of multiple New York office locations that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2013. •Consolidated other expense, net includes a $190 million impairment loss on our Cetip, S.A., or Cetip, investment and a $51 million expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt during the year ended December 31, 2013. The impairment of Cetip was driven primarily by the significant continued devaluation of the Brazilian real since the investment was made and the expectation that the currency is not going to sufficiently appreciate in the foreseeable future nor will the forecasted share price increase of Cetip be sufficient to recover the unrealized loss. Consolidated other expense, net, also increased in each of the last two years primarily due to increases in our consolidated interest expense resulting from increases in our total debt outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. See “- Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” below.•Adjusted net income attributable to ICE Group and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE Group common shareholders are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our core business performance, net of taxes. See “-Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. Factors Affecting Our Results50The business environments in which we operate directly affects our results of operations. Our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors, including the level of trading activity in our markets, which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions; competition; price volatility; market share and the pace of industry consolidation; broad trends in the brokerage and finance industry; price levels and price volatility; the number and financial health of companies listed on NYSE Euronext’s cash markets; geopolitical events; weather and disasters; real and perceived supply and demand imbalances; availability of capital; changing technology in the financial services industry; and legislative and regulatory changes; among other factors. In particular, in recent years, the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants’ demand for speed, capacity and reliability, which requires continuing investment in technology; and increasing competition for market data revenues. Price volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates the need for the exchange of risk between market participants. Market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market’s strength. The maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing.The implementation of new regulations may impact participation in our markets. Generally, legislative and regulatory bodies in the United States and Europe have expressed increased concern regarding derivatives markets when underlying commodity prices rise. As a result, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes. In particular, many of the proposed changes are still being implemented, and final regulations have not yet been adopted or significant uncertainties and ambiguities remain around adopted regulations. In addition, many market participants are still determining how they will respond to these regulations. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. We do, however, expect it to affect our business in various and potentially significant ways and possibly result in increased costs and the expenditure of significant resources. Uncertainty in the U.S. credit markets that commenced with the upheaval in 2008 continues to impact the economy. Equity market indices have experienced volatility, and the market has remained volatile throughout 2013. Economic uncertainty in the European Union may also continue to negatively affect global financial markets. In addition, regulatory uncertainty is affecting our clients’ activities, business models and technology spending. While markets may improve, these factors have adversely affected our revenues and operating income and may negatively impact future growth. We expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses. Any potential growth in the global cash markets will likely be tempered by investor uncertainty resulting from volatility in the cost of energy and commodities, unemployment concerns and contagion concerns in relation to the sovereign debt issues faced by some members of the Eurozone, uncertainty as to near term tax, regulatory, and other government policies, as well as the general state of the world economy. We continue to focus on our strategy to broaden and diversify our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives in connection with our acquisition of NYSE Euronext in order to mitigate these uncertainties.We also periodically make adjustments to our contract specifications. Changes to contracts are generally aimed at making the contracts more relevant to more customers and their evolving hedging needs or are required based on changes to the underlying commodity and may result in fluctuations in trading volume. These and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results.51Consolidated RevenuesThe following table presents our consolidated revenues (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change 2012 2011 ChangeRevenues: Transaction and clearing fees, net: North American natural gas futures and options contracts $182 $221 (18)% $221 $227 (3)%ICE Brent Crude futures and options contracts 228 214 7 214 190 12ICE Gasoil futures and options contracts 96 97 (1) 97 100 (2)Other oil futures and options contracts96 85 13 85 87 (3)Sugar futures and options contracts 90 80 12 80 69 16North American power futures and options contracts72 80 (11) 80 85 (6)ICE emission futures and options contracts 54 67 (19) 67 64 5Equity indexes futures and options contracts34 31 10 31 40 (23)Interest rates futures and options contracts29 — n/a — — —U.S. and European equity derivatives futures and options contracts18 — n/a — — —Other futures and options contracts141 118 19 118 100 18Credit default swaps 145 144 — 144 167 (13)U.S. and European cash equities166 — n/a — — —Other 51 48 7 48 47 7Total transaction and clearing fees, net 1,402 1,185 19 1,185 1,176 1Market data fees 212 147 45 147 125 17Listing fees35 — n/a — — —Other revenues 146 31 370 31 26 18Total revenues 1,795 1,363 32 1,363 1,327 3Transaction-based expenses 121 — n/a — — —Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses $1,674 $1,363 23 % $1,363 $1,327 3 %Transaction and Clearing Fees, netOur transaction and clearing fees consist of fees collected from our derivatives trading and clearing and, subsequent to our acquisition of NYSE Euronext on November 13, 2013, from our cash trading. In our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing fees from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared. Revenues for per-contract fees are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract. The amount of our per-contract transaction and clearing fees will depend upon many factors, including but not limited to transaction and clearing volume, pricing and new product introductions. The level of trading and clearing activity for all products is also influenced by market conditions and other factors. See “- Factors Affecting Our Results” above.Following our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we also recognize transaction and clearing fee revenues from executing trades of derivatives contracts and clearing charges on NYSE Liffe in London and NYSE Liffe U.S. and executing options contracts traded on NYSE Arca and NYSE Amex Options. The principal types of derivative contracts traded and cleared in these markets are interest rate products and equity and index products. Trading in short-term interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from uncertainty over the direction of short-term interest rates and trading in equity products is primarily driven by price volatility in equity markets and indices.In addition, we now recognize transaction and clearing fee revenues from cash trading. Cash trading consists of transaction charges for executing trades in our cash markets, as well as transaction charges related to orders in our U.S. cash markets which are routed to other market centers for execution. Additionally, our U.S. cash markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act of 1934. These fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. Activity assessment fees are collected from member organizations executing trades on our U.S. 52cash markets, and are recognized when these amounts are invoiced. Fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income.As a result of completed and pending regulatory changes in the United States that offer greater regulatory and operational certainty to futures market participants relative to the swaps market, on October 15, 2012, we transitioned all of our cleared OTC energy swaps contracts to futures contracts. As a result, our previously cleared North American natural gas, North American power and global oil and other contracts have been transitioned to futures and the prior periods' presentation of revenues and volumes have been reclassified to conform to this presentation. North American natural gas futures and options volumes decreased 18% for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, and increased 12% for the year ended December 31, 2012, from the comparable period in 2011. The decrease in volumes during the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily due to continued low volatility and low price levels for natural gas, which produced muted trading activity in comparison to the record volume levels established during the year ended December 31, 2012. The higher level of price volatility in 2012 was due in part to changes in expectations for natural gas inventories as the winter heating season progressed and changes in expectations for supply based on shale gas discoveries. The record volume during the year ended December 31, 2012 was also due to the introduction of new products, increased natural gas options volume and increased demand for hedging and risk management as market participants became less risk averse as the global financial markets stabilized. North American natural gas futures and options revenues decreased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2012, from the comparable period in 2011, despite the 12% increase in volumes during this same period of time, primarily due to increases in rebates relating to certain of these contracts during the year ended December 31, 2012.Our benchmark ICE Brent Crude futures contract is relied upon by a broad range of market participants, including large oil producing nations and multinational companies, to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption. Market participants are increasingly relying on the Brent North Sea contract for their risk management activities, as evidenced by steady increases in traded volumes and open interest over the past several years. Brent crude volume also increased due to growth in ICE Brent Crude options volume. Based on traded volume in both our ICE Brent Crude futures contract and our ICE WTI Crude futures contract, we achieved a 55%, 56% and 51% market share of the global oil futures contracts trading for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Other oil futures and options contracts include our global oil and refined products, WTI Crude oil, U.S. heating oil, RBOB gasoline and Middle East sour crude. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily due to the successful launch of new global oil and refined product contracts as demand for oil contracts rose. Effective January 1, 2012, we implemented a trading and clearing fee increase on our agricultural commodity futures and options contracts at ICE Futures U.S. as a result of increased regulatory staffing and regulatory burdens, the expansion of products developed and listed by the exchange, and significant enhancements in trading and clearing technology completed over the past five years. The rate per contract for ICE Futures U.S. agricultural commodity futures and options increased 11% to $2.59 per contract for the year ended December 31, 2012 from $2.33 per contract for the year ended December 31, 2011. The increase in the sugar futures and options contract revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012 is primarily due to this fee increase. Our North American power futures and options volumes increased 45% for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, while corresponding revenues decreased 11%. North American power futures and options volumes increased 53% for the year ended December 31, 2012, from the comparable period in 2011, while revenues decreased 6%. The North American power and futures options revenues decreased each of the last two years, despite the volume increases year over year, primarily due to growth in smaller sized power contracts, which have a lower rate per contract than the full sized North American power contracts. Of the 138 million North American power futures and options contracts traded during the year ended December 31, 2013, 134 million contracts, or 97%, represented smaller sized power contracts, which have a lower rate per contract than full sized North American power contracts, compared to 94% and 88% of the volume representing smaller sized contracts during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Volume in the larger North American power contracts decreased the last two years primarily due to lower volatility on absolute price levels, along with muted economic activity levels, which resulted in lower power production and consumption during the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. In addition, uncertainty related to financial reform, specifically rules relating to swaps markets, impacted both North American natural gas and power contract volumes during the year ended December 31, 2013. Our ICE emissions futures and options revenues decreased 19% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared to the same period in 2012, while volumes decreased 6%. Our ICE emissions futures and options revenues increased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011, while corresponding volumes increased 23%. The volume changes were greater than the revenue changes for each of the past two years primarily due to an increase in fee rebates each year and for the year ended December 31, 2012, a decrease in average exchange rate of the euro to the U.S. dollar compared to the year ended December 31, 2011. The ICE emissions futures and options contracts are billed in euros and the average exchange rate of the euro to 53the U.S. dollar, and the related U.S. dollar revenues, decreased 8% for the year ended December 31, 2012, compared to the same period in 2011. Our equity indexes futures and options revenues consist of trading in the Russell equity index, and subsequent to the NYSE Euronext acquisition, the FTSE equity index, MSCI equity index and ARCA Goldminers index. Our equity indexes futures and options revenues for the year ended December 31, 2012, which related to the Russell index only, decreased from the comparable period in 2011 primarily due to lower equity market inflows and lower volatility in the equity markets during 2012, especially in comparison to the higher volatility in the equity markets during 2011 due to the fiscal cliff and credit downgrade that occurred in the United States and the sovereign debt crisis in Europe. The increase in other futures and options revenues for the last two years is primarily due to increased trading volumes in our U.K. power, Dutch natural gas, natural gas liquids, cotton, coffee, and cocoa contracts and $13 million in revenues from NYSE Euronext other futures and options revenues for the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013, primarily relating to certain European derivatives contracts.CDS trade execution revenues at Creditex were $66 million, $78 million and $100 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The notional value of the underlying CDS traded was $904.4 billion, $1.1 trillion and $1.8 trillion for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The CDS execution business remains pressured due to financial reform implementation and a general lack of volatility in corporate credit markets.CDS clearing revenues at ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe were $79 million, $66 million and $67 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe cleared $10.7 trillion, $10.2 trillion and $11.6 trillion, respectively, of CDS notional value. With the advent of mandatory clearing during 2013, CDS clearing activity by investment funds, asset managers, and similar buy side market participants has increased significantly. We have cleared $3.9 trillion in CDS gross notional value by buy side market participants since inception, of which $3.7 trillion has been cleared since the CFTC’s clearing mandate went into effect in March 2013.Our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $511 million, $372 million and $296 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets, including NYSE Liffe derivatives markets following our NYSE Euronext acquisition, primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in rebates is due primarily to an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in the number of rebate programs offered and from higher contract volume traded under these programs during the periods.

Euronext derivatives include equity index products, single stock equities, currencies, wheat-milling, rapeseed, corn and barley malting products. Market Data Fees We generate revenues from the dissemination of our market data to a variety of users. In our derivatives markets, market data fees primarily relate to subscription fee revenues charged for user and license access from data vendors and from the end users, view only market data access, direct access services, terminal access, daily indexes and end of day reports. In addition, we provide a service in our derivatives markets to independently establish market price validation curves whereby participant companies subscribe to receive consensus market valuations. We earn user and license revenues that we receive from data vendors through the distribution of real-time and historical futures prices and other futures market data derived from trading in our futures markets. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized $62 million, $59 million and $51 million, respectively, in market data user and license fees from data vendors. During the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized $85 million, $73 million and $60 million, respectively, in market data access fees. We charge a market data access fee for access to our electronic platform and the increases for the last two years relate to higher fees charged per user and increases in the number of users. Following our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we now also charge the end user directly for real-time and historical futures prices and other futures market data in certain of our markets, including our interest rates markets. Following our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we now earn market data fees relating to our cash trading market data services. In the United States, we collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data products. Consortium-based data fees are dictated as part of the securities industry plans and charged to 56vendors based on their redistribution of data. Consortium-based data revenues from the dissemination of market data (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of a formula set by the SEC under Regulation NMS. Last sale prices and quotes in NYSE-listed, NYSE MKT-listed, and NYSE Arca-listed securities are disseminated through “Tape A” and “Tape B,” which constitute the majority of our U.S. revenues from consortium-based market data revenues. We also receive a share of the revenues from “Tape C,” which represents data related to trading of certain securities that are listed on Nasdaq. These revenues are influenced by demand for the data by professional and nonprofessional subscribers. In addition, we receive fees for the display of data on television and for vendor access. Our proprietary products make market data available to subscribers covering activity that takes place solely on our U.S. markets, independent of activity on other markets. Our proprietary data products also include depth of book information, historical price information and corporate action information. We also offer NYSE Realtime Reference Prices, which allows internet and media organizations to buy real-time, last-sale market data from NYSE and provide it broadly and free of charge to the public. CNBC, Google Finance and nyse.com display NYSE Realtime stock prices on their respective websites.In Europe, we charge a variety of users, primarily the end-users, for the use of Euronext’s cash trading real-time market data services. We also collect annual license fees from vendors for the right to distribute Euronext market data to third parties and a service fee from vendors for direct connection to market data. A substantial majority of European market data revenues is derived from monthly end-user fees. We also derive revenues from selling historical and reference data about securities, and by publishing the daily official lists for the Euronext markets. The principal drivers of market data revenues are the number of end-users and the prices for data packages.During the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013, we recognized market data fee revenues from NYSE Euronext derivative market data services and cash trading market data services of $50 million. Listing Fees Following our NYSE Euronext acquisition, we recognize listing fee revenues in our cash equity markets from two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our U.S. and European securities exchanges - listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate-related actions. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are generally not applicable to companies that transfer to one of our U.S. securities exchanges from another market, except for companies transferring to NYSE MKT from the over-the-counter market. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be listed, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee.Original listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of nine years for the NYSE and the Euronext cash equities markets and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE MKT. Other corporate action listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of six years for the NYSE and the Euronext cash equities markets and three years for NYSE Arca and NYSE MKT. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet. We have determined that, at the time of our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we did not have a legal performance obligation relating to these listing fees. Therefore, in connection with purchase accounting and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, we assigned a fair value of zero to the NYSE Euronext unamortized deferred revenue balances relating to the listing fees as of the acquisition date of November 13, 2013 (the historical NYSE Euronext listing fees deferred revenue balance as of that date was $486 million). The unamortized deferred revenue balances as of December 31, 2013 of $7 million relates to listing fees incurred and billed and not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the November 13, 2013 acquisition through December 31, 2013.In the United States, annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of listed U.S. companies at the end of the prior year. Non-U.S. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the United States. Annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year.Listing fees for our European markets comprise admission fees paid by issuers to list securities on the cash market, annual fees paid by companies whose financial instruments are listed on the cash market, and corporate activity and other fees, consisting primarily of fees charged by Euronext Paris and Euronext Lisbon for centralizing securities in IPOs and tender offers. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on a company's (estimated) market capitalization at the time of its IPO. Revenues from annual listing fees essentially relate to the number of shares outstanding and the market capitalization of the listed company.In general, Euronext Paris, Euronext Amsterdam, Euronext Brussels and Euronext Lisbon and LIFFE Administration and Management (Euronext London) have adopted a common set of listing fees. Under the harmonized fee book, domestic issuers (i.e., those from France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Portugal) pay admission fees to list their securities based on the market capitalization of the respective issuer. Subsequent listings of securities receive a discount on admission fees. Domestic issuers also pay annual fees based on the number of equity securities and their respective market capitalizations. Non-domestic companies listing in 57connection with raising capital are charged admission and annual fees on a similar basis, although they are generally charged lower maximum admission fees and annual fees. Non-domestic companies that are included in the Euronext 100 index are treated as domestic for purposes of their listing fees and their annual fees. Non-domestic companies eligible to the Euronext 100 index based on their market capitalization are also treated as domestic issuers for purpose of their sole listing fees. Euronext Paris and Euronext Lisbon also charge centralization fees for collecting and allocating retail investor orders in IPOs and tender offers.Other Revenues Prior to our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, other revenues related to various fees and services provided to our customers, including connectivity fees, ICE Chat and WhenTech subscription fees, ICE Endex membership fees, agricultural grading and certification fees, regulatory penalties and fines, interest income on certain clearing margin deposits and NYSE Liffe clearing services fees (prior to the NYSE Euronext acquisition). Following our acquisition, other revenues also include technology services revenues, trading license fees, fees for facilities, regulatory fees, listed company service fees, designated market marker service fees, and fees for clearance and settlement activities in our European markets. Regulatory fees are charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges and recognized by us as other revenue.Technology service revenues are generated primarily from connectivity services related to the SFTI and FIX networks, software licenses and maintenance fees, as well as from consulting services. Colocation revenue is recognized monthly over the life of the contract. We also generate revenues from software license contracts and maintenance agreements. We provide software that allows customers to receive comprehensive market-agnostic connectivity, transaction and data management solutions. Software license revenues are recognized at the time of client acceptance and maintenance agreement revenues are recognized monthly over the life of the maintenance term subsequent to acceptance. Consulting services are offered for customization or installation of the software and for general advisory services. Consulting revenue is generally billed in arrears on a time and materials basis, although customers sometimes prepay for blocks of consulting services in bulk. We record revenues from subscription agreements on a pro rata basis over the life of the subscription agreements. The unrealized portions of invoiced subscription fees, maintenance fees and prepaid consulting fees are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet.We recognized $84 million in other revenues from NYSE Euronext from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013, including $41 million relating to technology service revenues, with the remaining amount primarily for trading license fees, fees for servicing existing listed companies, services provided to designated market makers, fees from brokers and clerks physically located on the trading floor and regulatory fees. In addition to the NYSE Euronext other revenues, the increase in other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, is primarily due to revenues that we recorded following the WhenTech acquisition in September 2012 and the ICE Endex acquisition in March 2013, a reduction in the net interest paid to clearing members for their cash margin deposits at ICE Clear Europe and the fees that we recognized relating to the clearing services agreement for ICE Clear Europe to provide clearing services to NYSE Liffe from July 1, 2013 to November 12, 2013. The interest paid to clearing members is recorded as a reduction to other revenues. Effective January 1, 2013, ICE Clear Europe no longer pays clearing members basis points on certain cash margin deposits. Transaction-Based Expenses Following our acquisition of NYSE Euronext on November 13, 2013, we pay the SEC fees pursuant to Section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for transactions executed on U.S. security exchanges. These Section 31 fees are designed to recover the costs to the government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. We, in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing fees in the consolidated statements of income and in transaction-based expenses, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the U.S. securities exchanges and recognizes these amounts when invoiced. Fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees. As a result, neither the size of Section 31 fees nor the size of activity assessment fees has an impact on our net income.We incur routing charges in the United States when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our U.S. securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We include costs incurred due to erroneous trade execution within routing and clearing. Furthermore, NYSE Arca incurs clearance, brokerage and related transaction expenses, which primarily include costs incurred in self-clearing activities, and per trade service fees paid to exchanges for trade execution. Section 31 fees and routing fees collected from customers are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on our revenue recognition policies.58Consolidated Operating Expenses The following table presents our consolidated operating expenses (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change 2012 2011 ChangeCompensation and benefits $331 $251 32% $251 $250 —%Technology and communication 69 46 52 46 48 (4)Professional services 60 33 81 33 35 (5)Rent and occupancy 43 19 123 19 19 1Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs 165 19 751 19 16 24Selling, general and administrative 55 37 49 37 34 7Depreciation and amortization 161 131 23 131 132 (1)Total operating expenses $884 $536 65% $536 $534 —%We expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with reflecting a full year of NYSE Euronext expenses, and the growth of our business and to vary from year to year in future periods based on the type and level of our acquisitions and other investments.Compensation and benefits expenses Consolidated compensation and benefits expenses increased for the last two years primarily due to increases in our employee headcount and employee termination costs. Our 2013 employee headcount increased primarily relating to the NYSE Euronext acquisition. Headcount increased from 1,013 employees as of December 31, 2011 to 1,077 employees as of December 31, 2012, an increase of 6%, and, excluding the NYSE Euronext employees, increased to 1,133 employees as of December 31, 2013, an increase of 5% compared to the prior year. As of December 31, 2013, we also had 3,099 employees relating to our NYSE Euronext acquisition. For the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013, we recognized compensation and benefits expenses of $75 million relating to NYSE Euronext. In addition to the headcount increase relating to the NYSE Euronext employees, additional headcount increases over the last several years were primarily due to other acquisitions and internal hiring for clearing, technology and compliance operations. Non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $56 million, $52 million and $53 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We incurred employee termination costs of $7 million for both the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012. The employee terminations during 2013 primarily related to broker terminations at Creditex, and terminations during 2012 primarily relating to our closure of the ICE Futures U.S. open outcry trading floor and additional broker terminations at Creditex. We also had $63 million in termination costs that occurred following our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, which are included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below. The increases in compensation and benefits expenses due to employee headcount increases, employee termination expenses and non-cash compensation expenses increases were partially offset by decreases in our broker bonuses for each of the last two years relating to reduced Creditex CDS financial performance. Technology and Communication Expenses Consolidated technology and communication expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to costs incurred at NYSE Euronext following our acquisition. We recognized $20 million in technology and communication expenses relating to NYSE Euronext during the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013. Professional Services Expenses Consolidated professional services expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to costs incurred at NYSE Euronext following our acquisition. We recognized $29 million in professional services expenses relating to NYSE Euronext during the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013. Rent and Occupancy ExpensesConsolidated rent and occupancy expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to costs incurred at NYSE Euronext following our acquisition and $7 million in duplicate rent expenses and lease 59termination costs relating to the consolidation of multiple New York office locations that occurred during 2013. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. We recognized $14 million in rent and occupancy expenses relating to NYSE Euronext during the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013. Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration CostsWe incurred $165 million in consolidated acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relating to our acquisitions of NYSE Euronext and ICE Endex. Of this amount, $97 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, deal-related bonuses to certain of our employees and other external costs directly related to the closed or proposed transactions. We also incurred $68 million in integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2013, subsequent to the NYSE Euronext acquisition, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the potential Euronext IPO, deal related bonuses and professional services costs incurred relating to the integration. We incurred consolidated acquisition-related transaction costs during the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily relating to our pending acquisitions of NYSE Euronext and ICE Endex, our acquisition of WhenTech, and a potential acquisition that did not occur and is no longer being actively pursued. During the year ended December 31, 2011, these costs primarily related to our potential acquisition of NYSE Euronext during 2011 and our Cetip investment. We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we will incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to costs incurred at NYSE Euronext following our acquisition. We recognized $15 million in selling, general and administrative expenses relating to NYSE Euronext during the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013. Consolidated selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2012, from the comparable period in 2011, primarily due to increases in certain expenses related to taxes other than income taxes, travel and entertainment and insurance for the year ended December 31, 2012. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses We recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on the Russell licensing agreement intangible assets, of $76 million, $69 million and $76 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Amortization expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to additional amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets associated with our acquisition of NYSE Euronext. We recognized $10 million in amortization expenses on the NYSE Euronext intangible assets during the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013. Amortization expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2012, from the comparable period in 2011, primarily due to certain intangible assets acquired in prior acquisitions becoming fully amortized during the year ended December 31, 2012. We recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $85 million, $61 million and $57 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. We recognized $16 million in depreciation expenses relating to the NYSE Euronext fixed assets during the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013. Depreciation expenses also increased for each of the past two years primarily due to additional depreciation expenses recorded on increased fixed asset additions and capitalized internally developed software, including the building we purchased in Atlanta, Georgia in July 2013 for $38 million, which will be depreciated over its estimated remaining useful life of 30 years. See “- Cash Flow - Investing Activities” below. 60Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expenses) The following tables present our consolidated non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change 2012 2011 ChangeOther income (expense): Interest and investment income $3 $2 102% $2 $3 (35)%Interest expense (56) (39) 45 (39) (35) 13Other expense, net (237) — n/a — (1) (95)Total other expense, net $(290) $(37) 677% $(37) $(33) 13 %Net income attributable to non-controlling interest $(16) $(10) 58% $(10) $(12) 16 %The increases in consolidated interest expense over the last two years are primarily due to an increase in the overall amount of debt outstanding during each of the periods. See “- Debt” below. We acquired 31.6 million shares, or 12%, of the common stock of Cetip for an aggregate consideration of $514 million in cash in July 2011. We account for our investment in Cetip as an available-for-sale investment and it is classified as a long-term investment in our consolidated balance sheet. As of December 31, 2013, the fair value of the equity security investment was $324 million. Our investment in Cetip was made in, and the shares are valued in, Brazilian reais. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale securities that are considered to be temporary are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income, and include the effects of both stock price and foreign currency translation fluctuations. The unrealized holding gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income until realized. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary are recognized in earnings. The accumulated losses of $190 million as of December 31, 2013, including losses of $67 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, resulted from $162 million in foreign currency translation losses relating to the decrease in value of the Brazilian real relative to the U.S. dollar from the investment date in July 2011 through December 31, 2013 and by a $28 million decrease in the stock price of Cetip through December 31, 2013.The impairment of Cetip of $190 million was recorded as other expense and was driven primarily by the significant continued devaluation of the Brazilian real since the investment was made and the expectation that the currency is not going to appreciate in the foreseeable future nor will the forecasted share price of Cetip increase be sufficient to recover the unrealized loss. The impairment will not be deductible for income tax purposes. Refer to Note 5 to our consolidation financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on this impairment.On October 16, 2013, following the issuance of $1.4 billion in Senior Notes (as defined below), we prepaid our Private Senior Notes (as defined below) representing $400 million aggregate principal amount. In connection with the early payoff of the Private Senior Notes, we incurred $51 million in expenses relating to a $49 million pre-payment to the Private Senior Notes investors and an associated $2 million write off of the debt issuance costs. The $51 million pre-payment expense was recorded as other expense. See “- Debt” below.We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense) and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods.During the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred $3 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters, which were recorded as other expense. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we settled two outstanding legal matters by paying the separate plaintiffs a cash payment, and we sold our minority stake in an exchange located in China that was acquired as part of the assets of CLE. The two legal settlements and the divestiture, none of which were individually significant, resulted in a net loss of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 and were recorded as other expense. Partially offsetting these other expenses were dividend income received relating to our Cetip investment, which was $8 million, $5 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. For consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as non-controlling interests. As of December 31, 2012, non-controlling interest related to the operating results of our CDS clearing subsidiaries in which non-ICE limited partners held a 45.5% net profit sharing interest. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we purchased 3% of the net profit sharing interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries from various non-ICE limited partners and the remaining non-ICE limited partners hold a 42.5% net 61profit sharing interest as of December 31, 2013. In connection with our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we now a have non-controlling interest related to various minority ownership interests held in our majority owned subsidiary, NYSE Amex Options. In connection with our 79% acquisition of the derivatives and spot gas business of the former APX-ENDEX on March 26, 2013, Gasunie’s 21% ownership is included in the non-controlling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date. The increase in the net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable periods in 2012, is primarily related to these new non-controlling interests and the increase in the CDS clearing revenues during the year ended December 31, 2013. The decrease in the net income attributable to non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2012, from the comparable period in 2011, is primarily related to the decrease in the CDS revenues during this same period. See “- Consolidated Revenues - Transaction and Clearing Fees” above. Income Tax Provision Consolidated income tax expense was $230 million, $228 million and $238 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the change in our pre-tax income and the change in our effective tax rate each year. Our effective tax rate was 46%, 29% and 31% for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 is higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the non-tax deductible impairment loss on the Cetip investment along with state income taxes, a foreign tax law change and other items. Other items are primarily driven by non-tax deductible transaction costs relating to the NYSE Euronext acquisition and the effect of tax rate changes on our deferred tax balances. These unfavorable adjustments were partially offset by the favorable foreign tax rate differential. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 2012 and 2011 are lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the favorable foreign tax rate differential, partially offset by state income taxes.Quarterly Results of Operations We believe the following quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of income data has been prepared on substantially the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations for the quarters presented. The historical results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for any future period. This unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly data should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following table sets forth quarterly consolidated statements of income data (in millions): 62 Three Months Ended, December 31, 2013(1) September 30, 2013 June 30, 2013 March 31, 2013 December 31, 2012 September 30, 2012 June 30, 2012 March 31, 2012Revenues: Transaction and clearing fees, net: North American natural gas futures and options contracts$44 $39 $49 $50 $47 $48 $55 $71ICE Brent Crude futures and options contracts50 58 62 58 49 56 59 50ICE Gasoil futures and options contracts21 24 26 25 23 25 24 25Other oil futures and options contracts21 25 25 25 20 21 21 23Sugar futures and options contracts18 23 27 22 14 20 25 21North American power futures and options contracts17 16 20 19 20 18 20 22ICE emission futures and options contracts13 10 14 17 21 16 14 16Equity indexes futures and options contracts12 7 8 7 7 7 9 8Interest rates futures and options contracts29 — — — — — — —U.S. and European equity derivatives futures and options contracts18 — — — — — — —Other futures and options contracts42 29 37 33 29 25 33 31Credit default swaps34 38 40 33 35 33 36 40U.S. and European cash equities166 — — — — — — —Other18 11 11 11 12 10 11 15Total transaction and clearing fees, net503 280 319 300 277 279 307 322Market data fees91 40 40 41 38 36 37 36Listing fees35 — — — — — — —Other revenues104 18 13 11 9 8 7 7Total revenues733 338 372 352 324 323 351 365Transaction-based expenses121 — — — — — — —Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses612 338 372 352 324 323 351 365Operating expenses: Compensation and expenses138 60 67 66 56 62 65 68Technology and communication33 13 12 11 11 11 12 12Professional services37 7 8 8 8 8 8 9Rent and occupancy20 5 10 8 5 5 5 4Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs133 6 8 18 9 2 4 4Selling, general and administrative27 10 9 9 8 8 10 11Depreciation and amortization61 35 33 32 34 33 32 32Total operating expenses449 136 147 152 131 129 136 140Operating income163 202 225 200 193 194 215 225Other expense, net(2)264 9 8 9 9 9 9 10Income tax expense69 48 59 54 51 51 61 65Net income (loss)$(170) $145 $158 $137 $133 $134 $145 $150Net income attributable to non-controlling interest(6) (4) (5) (1) (3) (3) (2) (2)Net income (loss) attributable to ICE Group$(176) $141 $153 $136 $130 $131 $143 $148(1)We acquired NYSE Euronext on November 13, 2013 and have included their financial results in our results of operations for the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013.(2)Other expense, net for the three months ended December 31, 2013 includes a $190 million impairment loss on our Cetip investment and a $51 million expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt. See “- Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” above.63Liquidity and Capital Resources Since our inception, we have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases and the continued development of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures. In the future, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities. See “- Debt” and “- Future Capital Requirements” below. We also expect to use the net proceeds of the planned IPO of Euronext and the planned NYSE Technology divestiture to pay down certain of our outstanding debt. See “- Recent Developments” above.On November 13, 2013, we acquired NYSE Euronext in a stock and cash transaction. We paid cash consideration of $2.7 billion and issued an aggregate number of shares of common stock of 42.4 million shares to NYSE Euronext stockholders. The cash consideration was funded from cash on hand, $1.4 billion of net proceeds received in October 2013 in connection with ICE Group's public offering and sale of Senior Notes and $400 million of borrowings under our Revolving Facility (as defined below). We refinanced the new borrowings under our Revolving Facility and the $450 million borrowed under the 364 Day Facility (as defined below) through the issuance of a commercial paper program. See “- Debt” below. Upon maturity of old issuances and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. In order to mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain undrawn backstop bank facilities for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program. In case we would not be able to issue new commercial paper, we could draw on these backstop facilities, which would result in higher interest expense.Consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $961 million and $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We had $437 million and $391 million in short-term and long-term investments as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and $438 million and $250 million in short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with remaining maturity dates of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. We classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. Cash and investments that are not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and investments. As of December 31, 2013, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was $576 million. While we consider our non-U.S. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the United States, any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both U.S. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for any non-U.S. tax credits. However, we do not have any current needs or foreseeable plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. We may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.Certain of these investments, with an original maturity of greater than three months, will be classified as available-for-sale in accordance with relevant accounting standards. Available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. We do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading. As of December 31, 2013, $450 million remains available for stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program. We did not repurchase any shares of our common stock on the open market during the year ended December 31, 2013. During the year ended December 31, 2012, we repurchased 416,858 shares of our common stock on the open market at a cost of $53 million. Since 2008, we have repurchased 6.1 million shares of our common stock on the open market at a cost of $619 million. We expect to fund any remaining share repurchases with a combination of cash on hand, future cash flows and by borrowing under our credit facilities. The timing and extent of any future repurchases is at the discretion of our management and will depend upon market conditions, our stock price and our strategic plans at that time. We may discontinue our stock repurchases at any time. 64Cash Flow The following tables present the major components of net increases in cash and cash equivalents (in millions): Year Ended December 31,2013 2012 2011Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $735 $733 $713Investing activities (2,523) (118) (615)Financing activities 1,119 172 105Effect of exchange rate changes 18 2 (2)Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $(651) $789 $201Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital. Fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities are primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and, to a lesser extent, due to fluctuations in working capital.Investing Activities Consolidated net cash used in investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 primarily relates to cash paid for acquisitions, increases in the restricted cash and investment balances, purchases of available-for-sale investments, capitalized software development costs and capital expenditures. We paid cash for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $2.2 billion, $18 million and $10 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, primarily relating to the NYSE Euronext and ICE Endex acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2013 and the WhenTech acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2012. We had net increases in restricted cash and investments of $75 million, $32 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The restricted cash increase in 2013 primarily related to increases in the regulatory capital of ICE Futures Europe, ICE Clear Europe and ICE Futures U.S., resulting from adjustments to the regulatory capital calculations to no longer allow for certain deductions in the calculations of the six months of operating expenditures. The restricted cash increase in 2012 primarily related to mandated changes in the calculations of regulatory capital at ICE Futures Europe and ICE Clear Europe as well as additional costs incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses. Primarily for regulatory purposes, we purchased short-term available-for-sale investments of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 and we had a net increase in investments classified as available-for-sale of $512 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 due to the Cetip investment. We had capital expenditures of $136 million, $32 million and $57 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2012, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $45 million (including $8 million at NYSE Euronext subsequent to its acquisition on November 13, 2013), $36 million and $30 million for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms and clearing houses, purchases of corporate aircraft, and, for the year ended December 31, 2013, a $38 million purchase of a building in Atlanta Georgia to serve as our headquarters and $19 million in leasehold improvements associated with the new office space in New York. Financing Activities Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relates to $3.8 billion in borrowings under our debt facilities, partially offset by $2.5 billion in repayments under our debt facilities, $77 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises (including $52 million relating to treasury shares received for shares that vested for NYSE Euronext employees at the acquisition date), $75 million in dividend payments to our shareholders and a $49 million termination fee relating to the early payoff of debt. Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily relates to $295 million in borrowings under our debt facilities, partially offset by $53 million in repurchases of common stock, $50 million in repayments under the debt facilities and $19 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises. Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2011 primarily relates to $1.3 billion in borrowings under our debt facilities, partially offset by $992 million in repayments under our debt facilities, $175 million in repurchases of common stock and $16 million in debt issuance costs relating to the new credit facilities. See “- Debt” below for a discussion of the debt facilities.65Debt Our total debt, including short-term and long-term debt, consisted of the following as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 (in millions): As of December 31, 2013 2012Debt: Commercial Paper$1,080 $—Credit Facilities: Revolving Facility— 113Term Loan Facility55 50Short-term debt1,135 163Senior Notes: 2018 Senior Notes (2.5% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2018)599 —2023 Senior Notes (4.0% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2023)794 —NYSE Euronext Notes: NYSE Euronext EUR Notes (5.375% senior unsecured notes due June 30, 2015)1,353 —NYSE Euronext USD Notes (2.0% senior unsecured notes due October 5, 2017)854 —Credit Facilities: Revolving Facility— 182Term Loan Facility323 387Private Senior Notes— 400Long-term debt3,923 969Total debt$5,058 $1,132Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility (the Credit Facilities)In November 2011, we entered into senior unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $2.6 billion, or the Credit Facilities. The Credit Facilities include an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available for borrowing by $400 million during the term of the Credit Facilities. The Credit Facilities consist of (i) an aggregate $500 million five-year senior unsecured term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility, and (ii) an aggregate $2.1 billion five-year senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Facility. As of December 31, 2013, we have $378 million aggregate principal amount of borrowings outstanding in the form of a LIBOR rate loan with a stated interest rate of 2.41% per annum under the Term Loan Facility. The Credit Facilities mature on November 9, 2016. We may prepay the outstanding loans under the Credit Facilities, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty.During December 2012, we borrowed $295 million under the Revolving Facility for temporary borrowing capacity to facilitate intercompany transactions, all of which was subsequently repaid in 2013. On October 31, 2013, we borrowed $900 million under the Revolving Facility, of which $400 million were used to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for the acquisition of NYSE Euronext while the remaining $500 million was used to pay off the outstanding commercial paper obligations of NYSE Euronext, as well as to fund certain deal related fees and expenses. On December 24, 2013, we repaid the $900 million borrowed under the Revolving Facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, as discussed below, and with cash on hand. As of December 31, 2013, of the $2.1 billion that was available for borrowing under the Revolving Facility, $1.1 billion is required to back stop the Commercial Paper program discussed below, and $303 million is reserved for our clearing houses. Of the amounts available under the Revolving Facility: (i) $150 million of such amounts has been reserved to provide liquidity or required financial resources for the clearing operations of ICE Clear Europe, (ii) $100 million of such amounts has been reserved to provide liquidity or required financial resources for the clearing operations of ICE Clear Credit, (iii) $50 million of such amounts has been reserved to provide liquidity or required financial resources for the clearing operations of ICE Clear U.S., (iv) $3 million of such amounts has been reserved to provide liquidity or required financial resources for the clearing operations of ICE Clear Canada, and (v) the remainder, plus any portion of the proceeds no longer necessary to be reserved for the foregoing purposes, are available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes. From time to time, we may agree to provide additional liquidity to our subsidiaries to meet regulatory capital requirements, general corporate purposes or short term liquidity needs. 66On September 27, 2013, we agreed with the lenders under the Credit Facilities to amend the terms of the Credit Facilities to make certain changes, including, effective upon the consummation of the NYSE Euronext acquisition, to add ICE Group and NYSE Euronext as guarantors under the Credit Facilities and elevate reporting and financial covenants to ICE Group and its consolidated subsidiaries. The Credit Facilities contain affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, leverage and interest coverage ratios, as well as limitations or required notices or approvals for acquisitions, dispositions of assets and certain investments in subsidiaries, the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other matters. The Credit Facilities also contain other customary representations, warranties and covenants. Private Senior Notes Simultaneous with entering into the Credit Facilities in November 2011, we also entered into a note purchase agreement with various institutional investors providing for the sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes, consisting of $200 million of our 4.13% Senior Notes, Tranche A, due November 9, 2018 and $200 million of our 4.69% Senior Notes, Tranche B, due November 9, 2021, or collectively, the Private Senior Notes. The Private Senior Notes were sold in a private offering exempt from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. On September 27, 2013, we and the holders of the outstanding Private Senior Notes entered into a first amendment and waiver agreement, or the Amendment and Waiver, to the note purchase agreement. On October 16, 2013, following the issuance of the Senior Notes discussed below and in accordance with the Amendment and Waiver, we prepaid the $400 million aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes. In connection with the early payoff of the Private Senior Notes, we incurred $51 million in expenses relating to a $49 million pre-payment to the Private Senior Notes investors and an associated $2 million write off of the related debt issuance costs. The $51 million expense was recorded as other expense in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013. As discussed below, to fund the prepayment of the Private Senior Notes and the associated pre-payment, we borrowed $450 million on October 11, 2013 under the 364 Day Facility. Accrued interest of $8 million was also paid in connection with this prepayment. 364 Day Facility On July 12, 2013, we entered into a new $600 million 364 day senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 364 Day Facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and the lenders signatory thereto. The 364 Day Facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available by $200 million during the term of the 364 Day Facility. The 364 Day Facility may be used for our working capital and general corporate purposes. As discussed above, on October 11, 2013, we borrowed $450 million under the 364 Day Facility to fund the prepayment of the Private Senior Notes and associated pre-payment in an aggregate amount of $449 million. With certain exceptions, we may prepay the outstanding loans under the 364 Day Facility, in whole or in part, without premium or penalty. On December 20, 2013, we repaid the $450 million borrowed under the 364 Day Facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper, as discussed below. As of December 31, 2013, the full amount of $600 million was available for borrowing under our 364 Day Facility.On September 27, 2013, we agreed with the lenders under the 364 Day Facility to amend the terms of the 364 Day Facility in a manner substantially consistent with the amendments to the Credit Facilities as described above. The 364 Day Facility contains affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, leverage and interest coverage ratios, as well as limitations or required notices or approvals for acquisitions, dispositions of assets, the incurrence of additional debt or the creation of liens and other fundamental changes to our business that are substantially similar to those in the Credit Facilities. Senior Notes On October 8, 2013, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due 2018, or the 2018 Senior Notes, and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due 2023, or the 2023 Senior Notes, together with the 2018 Senior Notes, the Senior Notes. The 2018 Senior Notes will mature on October 15, 2018, and the 2023 Senior Notes will mature on October 15, 2023. Interest on the Senior Notes will be payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year, beginning on April 15, 2014.We used the net proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to finance, together with cash on hand and the $400 million borrowed on October 31, 2013 under the Revolving Facility, the $2.7 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of NYSE Euronext. The Senior Notes contain affirmative and negative covenants, including, but not limited to, certain redemption rights, limitations on liens and indebtedness, limitations on certain mergers, sales, dispositions and lease-back transactions. 67NYSE Euronext NotesIn connection with the acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we assumed the outstanding NYSE Euronext debt instruments. As of the November 13, 2013 acquisition date, NYSE Euronext had outstanding $850 million of 2.0% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in October 2017, or the NYSE Euronext USD Notes, and €920 million of 5.375% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in June 2015, or the NYSE Euronext EUR Notes, and together with the NYSE Euronext USD Notes, the NYSE Euronext Notes.In accordance with purchase accounting, we recorded these outstanding notes at fair value on the November 13, 2013 acquisition date. Based on public debt prices, as of this date, the NYSE Euronext USD Notes had a fair value of $854 million (an increase of $4 million from its November 13, 2013 face value) and the NYSE Euronext EUR Notes had a fair value of $1.3 billion (an increase of $89 million from its November 13, 2013 face value). The increase in the carrying amount of the NYSE Euronext Notes to record them at fair value is amortized as a reduction to the interest expense recorded by us in the consolidated statements of income over the remaining maturities of the NYSE Euronext Notes. As of December 31, 2013, the outstanding amounts under the NYSE Euronext USD Notes and the NYSE Euronext EUR Notes were $850 million and €920 million ($1.3 billion), respectively. The terms of the bonds do not contain any financial covenants. The bonds may be redeemed by us or the bond holders under certain customary circumstances, including a change in control accompanied by a downgrade of the bonds below an investment grade rating. The terms of the bonds also provide for customary events of default and a negative pledge covenant.Guarantees In order to avoid structural subordination among the Credit Facilities, 364 Day Facility, Senior Notes and the NYSE Euronext Notes, in connection with the acquisition of NYSE Euronext, the issuers and borrowers of these debt instruments entered into cross guarantees of these debt obligations while they are part of the same consolidated group. The guarantees of ICE Group, as a standalone entity, will remain in place until each applicable debt obligation has been satisfied. IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. and NYSE Euronext’s guarantees will remain in place until certain conditions are satisfied, which, in IntercontinentalExchange, Inc.’s case, includes IntercontinentalExchange, Inc. no longer being an obligor (issuer or borrower) under the Credit Facilities and, in NYSE Euronext’s case, includes ICE Group’s senior unsecured long-term indebtedness maintaining certain minimum credit ratings in the absence of the NYSE Euronext guarantee. This is only a summary of the full terms of the guarantees, which have been filed with the SEC.Commercial Paper ProgramOn December 16, 2013, we entered into a U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program, in order to refinance the borrowings under the Revolving Facility and the 364 Day Facility as described above. The Commercial Paper Program is backed by the borrowing capacity available under the Revolving Facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding. We used the net proceeds from the notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program along with cash on hand to repay the $900 million borrowed under the Revolving Facility and the $450 million borrowed under the 364 Day Facility. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (USD LIBOR). The fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may therefore impact our interest expense. Commercial paper notes with an aggregate par value of $1.1 billion and original maturities ranging from 1 to 97 days were outstanding as of December 31, 2013 under the Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2013, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.1 billion outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program was 0.28% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 33 days.Committed RepoTo provide liquidity of margin and guaranty fund deposits upon a clearing member default, ICE Clear U.S. entered into a $235 million Committed Repurchase Agreement Facility, or Committed Repo. The Committed Repo provides ICE Clear U.S. with liquidity in the event of a clearing member default that was associated with a market disruption that might make it difficult for ICE Clear U.S. to sell and settle on a same-day basis the defaulting clearing member’s initial margin and guaranty fund U.S. Treasury securities deposits. During the first half of 2014, ICE Clear U.S. intends to increase its Committed Repo to a total of $300 million. Similarly, during the first half 2014, ICE Clear Europe and ICE Clear Credit each intend to enter into $1 billion Committed Repos with approximately 10 international banks for liquidity purposes. Multicurrency Payment FacilityDuring December 2013, ICE Clear U.S. entered into a $75 million secured multicurrency payment facility with Euroclear Bank S.A. ICE Clear U.S. requires its clearing members to meet non-U.S. dollar payment obligations in the currency of the obligation. ICE Clear U.S. also accepts foreign currencies as collateral to satisfy original margin requirements for those contracts which are denominated in a foreign currency. This payment facility provides same-day liquidity for ICE Clear U.S. to make payments in all of its 68variation margin currencies if a clearing member were to fail to make payment in that currency, while using original margin from the defaulting clearing member as security. Future Capital Requirements Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our trading and clearing volume growth, strategic plans and acquisitions, required technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business, and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic platform. We currently expect to make aggregate operational capital expenditures and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between $180 million and $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology and the continued expansion of our businesses. In addition, we currently expect $50 million to $60 million in capital expenditures during 2014 on real estate expenditures, primarily associated with our new headquarters in Atlanta and our headquarters in New York. Following the acquisition of NYSE Euronext, our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board or audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio. During the fourth quarter of 2013, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share of our common stock for an aggregate payout of $75 million.As of December 31, 2013, we have $5.1 billion in outstanding debt. See “- Debt” above. As of December 31, 2013, we have $600 million available under our 364 Day Facility for general corporate purposes. After factoring in the $1.1 billion required to back stop the Commercial Paper Program and the $303 million reserved for our clearing houses as discussed above, as of December 31, 2013, $717 million of our Revolving Facility was available for general corporate purposes. The Commercial Paper Program is backed by the borrowing capacity available under the Revolving Facility, with the amount under the Revolving Facility reserved equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding. The Revolving Facility, the 364 Day Facility and the Commercial Paper Program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources. In the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise the necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. However, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. We believe that our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our debt, working capital needs and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future. We also expect to use the net proceeds of the planned IPO of Euronext and the planned NYSE Technology divestiture to pay down certain of our outstanding debt. See “- Recent Developments” above.We are obligated to contribute an aggregate of $100 million to the ICE Clear Credit guaranty fund and the ICE Clear Europe CDS guaranty fund and have already contributed $50 million to the ICE Clear Credit guaranty fund and $10 million to the ICE Clear Europe CDS guaranty fund as of December 31, 2013. We are obligated to contribute an additional $40 million to the ICE Clear Europe CDS guaranty fund and of the remaining contributions, $15 million is required to be made one year from the launch of CDS client clearing at ICE Clear Europe, or October 7, 2014, and the remaining $25 million is required to be made by October 7, 2015.When EMIR becomes effective later in 2014, the Bank of England restricted cash capital requirements for ICE Clear Europe will be superseded by the EMIR capital requirements, which would require an estimated increase in the liquid regulatory capital requirements ranging from $140 million to $150 million. This increase will be satisfied by way of additional restricted cash through our cash on hand. In connection with ICE Clear U.S.’s recognition as a third party QCCP, we contributed $50 million to ICE Clear U.S.’s guaranty fund as of January 1, 2014, through our cash on hand. See “- Recent Development and Trends - Restricted Cash and Investments"" above. Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures We use non-U.S. GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than U.S. GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-U.S. GAAP measures used by other companies. We use adjusted net income attributable to ICE Group and adjusted earnings per share attributable to ICE Group common shareholders because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our operating performance. We strongly recommend that investors 69review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.Adjusted net income attributable to ICE Group for the periods presented below is calculated by adding net income attributable to ICE Group, the adjustments described below, which are not reflective of our core business performance, and their related income tax effect. The following table reconciles net income attributable to ICE Group to adjusted net income attributable to ICE Group and calculates adjusted earnings per share attributable to ICE Group common shareholders for the periods presented below (in millions, except per share amounts): Year Ended December 31, Three Months Ended December 31, 2013 2012 2011 2013 2012 2011Net income (loss) attributable to ICE Group $254 $552 $510 $(176) $130 $127Add: Cetip impairment loss190 — — 190 — —Add: NYSE Euronext transaction and integration costs and banker fees related to other transactions162 9 4 131 9 —Add: Duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs7 — — — — —Add: Early payoff of outstanding debt 51 — — 51 — —Add: Costs expensed related to the Credit Facilities— — 3 — — 3Less: Income tax effect related to the items above and impact of certain foreign tax law changes(18) (4) (1) (4) (4) (1)Adjusted net income attributable to ICE Group $646 $557 $516 $192 $135 $129Earnings (loss) per share attributable to ICE Group common shareholders: Basic $3.24 $7.59 $6.97 $(1.85) $1.78 $1.75Diluted $3.21 $7.52 $6.90 $(1.83) $1.76 $1.73Adjusted earnings per share attributable to ICE Group common shareholders: Adjusted basic $8.24 $7.66 $7.05 $2.02 $1.86 $1.77Adjusted diluted $8.17 $7.60 $6.98 $2.00 $1.84 $1.75Weighted average common shares outstanding: Basic 78 73 73 95 73 73Diluted 79 73 74 96 73 73We include acquisition-related transaction costs as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. However, we are including all of the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to our acquisition of NYSE Euronext as non-U.S. GAAP adjustments given the size of the acquisition. During the year and three months ended December 31, 2013, in addition to the NYSE Euronext acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, we also include as adjustments the impairment loss recorded on our equity investment in Cetip, the banker success fee relating to the acquisition of ICE Endex, the expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt, the impact of certain foreign tax law changes that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs we incurred as we consolidated multiple New York office locations in the current year. During the year and three months ended December 31, 2012, we recognized as an adjustment transaction-related costs relating to our acquisition of NYSE Euronext. During the year and/or three months ended December 31, 2011, we recognized as adjustments a banker fee related to our investment in Cetip and certain interest expenses related to our Credit Facilities. For additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. 70Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table presents, for the periods indicated, our contractual obligations (which we intend to fund from operations) and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2013 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 YearsContractual Obligations: Short-term and long-term debt and interest $5,597 $1,277 $1,799 $1,561 $960Russell licensing agreement (minimum annual payments) 75 20 40 15 —Additional funding of ICE Clear Europe's guaranty fund under EMIR requirements150 150 — — —Commitment to fund ICE Clear Europe's CDS guaranty fund40 15 25 — —Funding of ICE Clear U.S.'s guaranty fund under QCCP requirements50 50 — — —Operating lease obligations 488 81 121 75 211Other liabilities and commitments 5 2 2 1 —Total contractual cash obligations $6,405 $1,595 $1,987 $1,652 $1,171We have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above $42.2 billion in cash margin deposits and guaranty fund liabilities. Clearing members of ICE Clear Europe, ICE Clear U.S., ICE Clear Credit, ICE Clear Canada and TCC are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. The cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits and guaranty funds’ liabilities. We have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or UTBs, from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above. As of December 31, 2013, our cumulative UTBs were $223 million. Interest and penalties related to UTBs were $39 million as of December 31, 2013. We are under continuous examination by various tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict, the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. It is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. See note 10 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our UTBs. As of December 31, 2013, in connection with our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs. The external investors in our NYSE Amex Options market have received an equity instrument and have the option to require us to repurchase a portion of the instruments on an annual basis through 2015. The amount we are required to purchase under this arrangement is capped each year at between 5% and 15% of the total outstanding shares of NYSE Amex Options. In addition, the external investor in ICE Endex has a put option to sell its remaining stake to us two years from the date of closing of the acquisition and it expires five years from the date of closing. We recognized the full redemption values, i.e. fair values, of $322 million relating to these two instruments as mezzanine equity and classified the related balances as part of ""Redeemable non-controlling interest"" in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2013. However, we cannot estimate whether, and if they do, when the external investors will elect to exercise their remaining put options. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the redeemable non-controlling interest. New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.71Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to the accounting matters described below. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments. Based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. The values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets We have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. As of December 31, 2013, we had goodwill of $9.5 billion and net other intangible assets of $9.4 billion relating to our acquisitions, our purchase of trademarks and Internet domain names from various third parties, and the Russell licensing agreement. Of these amounts, $7.5 billion in goodwill and $8.6 billion of other intangible assets relates to our acquisition of NYSE Euronext on November 13, 2013. We do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over the lesser of their contractual or estimated useful lives. In performing the purchase price allocation, we consider, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. At the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation. We continue to review and validate estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period. Accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. Subsequent to our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we have identified five reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our CDS reporting unit, our cash listings reporting unit, our Euronext reporting unit and our technology reporting unit. The cash listings, Euronext and technology reporting units were added as part of our NYSE Euronext acquisition on November 13, 2013. Goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. The initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. However, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to 72the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. For annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. Otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. For annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount. Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. These estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. Future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets through December 31, 2013. In the past, since the fair value of our futures and market data reporting units have significantly exceeded their carrying values, we have exercised our option to perform qualitative assessments to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of these reporting units were less than their carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. However, as we combined our futures and market data reporting units into one combined futures reporting unit during the year ended December 31, 2013, we proceeded directly to the preparation of a discounted cash flow valuation to estimate the fair value of our futures reporting unit. The discounted cash flow valuation indicated a fair value of our futures reporting unit significantly exceeding its carrying value. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill in our futures reporting units in the foreseeable future. Given the acquisition of NYSE Euronext on November 13, 2013, we determined impairment analysis was not needed for our cash listings, Euronext and technology reporting units during the fourth quarter 2013 goodwill analysis testing.Among our reporting units, the fair value of our CDS reporting unit has been the closest to its carrying value in prior goodwill impairment analyses. Our CDS reporting unit includes the financial results and net assets of Creditex, ICE Clear Credit and the CDS clearing business at ICE Clear Europe. CDS trade execution revenues at Creditex have decreased the last several years. The CDS execution business remains pressured due to financial reform implementation and a general lack of volatility in the corporate credit markets. However, the decline in CDS trading revenues was offset by an increase in ICE CDS clearing, the listing of additional cleared CDS products, and signing on new clearing members, along with a decrease in expenses at Creditex. Also, with the advent of mandatory clearing during 2013, CDS clearing activity by investment funds, asset managers, and similar buy side market participants has increased significantly.During the first step of the CDS impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2013, we performed a discounted cash flow valuation to estimate the fair value of our CDS reporting unit. The valuation of our CDS reporting unit concluded that the fair value exceeded carrying value by $164 million, or 24% of the carrying value in the fourth quarter of 2013. As of December 31, 2013, the CDS goodwill and other intangible assets balances were $494 million. The discount rate used in the CDS discounted cash flow valuation is intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the CDS reporting unit and was 12.4% in the fourth quarter 2013 review. A 10 basis point increase in the discount rate used would not have a material impact on our fair value of the CDS reporting unit. A 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the CDS reporting unit would result in the fair value of the reporting unit exceeding the carrying value by $79 million. Given the current market conditions and continued economic and regulatory uncertainty, the fair value of our CDS reporting unit may deteriorate and could result in the need to record an impairment charge in future periods. We continue to monitor potential triggering events in our CDS reporting unit, including changes in the business and regulatory climate in which it operates, the current volatility in the capital markets, our recent operating performance and our financial projections. Any changes in these factors could result in an impairment charge. We are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is 73compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. If an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. Fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis. Our evaluation has not resulted in any impairment of other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment through December 31, 2013. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse. We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. The undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been made in our consolidated financial statements. A distribution of these non-U.S. earnings in the form of dividends, or otherwise, could subject us to both U.S. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for non-U.S. tax credits, and withholding taxes payable to the various non-U.S. countries. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable. We operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. Revenue Recognition - Listing Fees In connection with our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, there are two types of fees applicable to companies listed on the NYSE, NYSE Arca, NYSE MKT and Euronext - listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate action. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that the company initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are generally not applicable to companies that transfer to one of our U.S. securities exchanges from another market, except for companies transferring to NYSE MKT from the over-the-counter market. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares. Annual fees are recognized on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Original listing fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over their estimated service periods of nine years for NYSE and Euronext, and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE MKT. Other corporate listing fees are recognized on a straight-line basis over their estimated service periods of six years for NYSE and Euronext, and three years for NYSE Arca and NYSE MKT. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet. We have determined that, at the time of our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we did not have a legal performance obligation relating to these listing fees. Therefore, in connection with purchase accounting and in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we wrote off and assigned a fair value of zero to the NYSE Euronext unamortized deferred revenue balances relating to the listing fees as of the acquisition date of November 13, 2013 (the historical NYSE Euronext listing fees deferred revenue balance as of that date was $486 74million). The unamortized deferred revenue balances as of December 31, 2013 of $7 million relates to listing fees incurred and billed and not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the November 13, 2013 acquisition through December 31, 2013.Pension and Other Post-Retirement Employee Benefits In connection with our acquisition of NYSE Euronext, we assumed NYSE Euronext’s pension plans and other post-retirement employee benefit plans covering its U.S. and certain European operations. Pension and other post-retirement employee benefits costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates to measure future obligation and interest expense, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, mortality rates, and other factors. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and future expense.ITEM 7 (A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments were $1.8 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, of which $819 million and $519 million, respectively, were denominated in Brazilian reais, pounds sterling, euros or Canadian dollars. Changes in the Cetip investment, which is recorded as an available-for-sale, long-term investment and was recorded in and is held in Brazilian reais, was valued at $324 million as of December 31, 2013. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of the Cetip investment. The remaining investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. A hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $4 million, as of December 31, 2013, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments. As of December 31, 2013, we had $5.1 billion in outstanding indebtedness, of which $1.4 billion relates to the Senior Notes and $2.2 billion relates to the NYSE Euronext Notes, both of which bear interest at fixed interest rates. Of the remaining amount outstanding, $1.1 billion relates to the Commercial Paper Program and $378 million relates to the Term Loan Facility, both of which bear interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program and Term Loan Facility would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $15 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. The interest rates on our Commercial Paper Program and Term Loan Facility are currently reset on a daily, monthly or quarterly basis. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Debt” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk As an international group, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in euros or pounds sterling. Certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. 75Our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the year ended December 31, 2013 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (in millions, except average rates): Year ended December 31, 2013 Euro Pound SterlingAverage rate in the period$1.3282 $1.5643Average rate in the same period one year before$1.2853 $1.5841Foreign denominated percentage of: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses11% 5 %Operating expenses5% 15 %Operating income18% (7)%Impact of the currency fluctuations (1) on: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses$6 $(1)Operating expenses$1 $(2)Operating income$5 $1(1)Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to the same period in the prior year.NYSE Euronext, which we acquired on November 13, 2013, has a significant part of its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in euros or pounds sterling. For the month of December 2013, which included the results of NYSE Euronext for the entire month, 32% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in euros or pounds sterling and 29% of our consolidated expenses were denominated in euros or pounds sterling. As the euro or pound sterling exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. We have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We had foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. A 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2013 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $16 million, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity.We entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 as economic hedges to hedge a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. We have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. Our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): As of December 31, 2013 Position in euros Position in pounds sterlingAssets€4,094 £2,732 of which goodwill represents1,359 1,073Liabilities1,991 390of which borrowings represent1,003 —Net currency position before hedging activities€2,103 £2,342Impact of hedging activities(72) 192Net currency position€2,031 £2,534Impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates$280 $420To hedge against these exposures, at December 31, 2013, we had €157 million ($216 million) of euro/U.S. dollar, £192 million (€229 million) of pound sterling/euro dollar and £15 million ($25 million) of pound sterling/U.S. dollar foreign exchange hedging contracts outstanding. These contracts mature between January and February 2014 and had a fair value of $4 million (asset) at December 31, 2013. Additionally, NYSE Euronext's borrowing in euro of €0.9 billion ($1.3 billion) constitutes a partial hedge of 76NYSE Euronext's net euro investment in foreign entities. The pre tax loss of $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2013 was recorded as a component of other comprehensive income as a result of this partial net investment hedge. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation was $377 million and $73 million, respectively. Based on December 31, 2013 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of euro against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $280 million and a hypothetical 10% decrease of pound sterling against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $420 million. For the year ended December 31, 2013, currency exchange rate differences had a positive impact of $304 million on our consolidated equity.Credit Risk We are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. Our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. We seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk. Clearing House Cash Deposits Credit RiskOur clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are invested to generate interest income for our clearing members. Refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on the clearing houses cash deposits, which were $42.2 billion as of December 31, 2013. Following is a summary of the risks associated with this investment activity and how these risks are mitigated.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of the purchased security to decline. If we were required to sell the security prior to its maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the security might be made at a loss relative to its original purchase price. Our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making all of our cash deposit investments in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 1 to 37 days. Our clearing house investment guidelines require that a minimum of 50% of clearing member cash deposits are invested in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 1 business day. Efforts are made to invest the remaining 50% in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 37 business days. If this is not possible, our policy allows for the investment of up to 50% of clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt (for example, U.S. Treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (Euro cash deposits only) with the shortest possible time to maturity provided that no such direct investment in a sovereign debt or supranational instrument will have a time to maturity greater than 397 days (1.09 years).Security Issuer RiskSecurity issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. This risk is mitigated by investing clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements or direct investments in high quality sovereign and supranational debt issues. Thus, the risk is mitigated because, in the event of a security issuer default, we are left with a highly marketable, liquid security.Investment Counterparty RiskInvestment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty or an investment adviser might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and investment advisors.When engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts that are under the control of our clearing house. Additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. The typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterpart defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty’s obligation to our clearing house.77Our clearing houses do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments with any of our investment advisors. Our clearing house property is held in custody accounts controlled by our clearing houses. Our clearing houses' property is held with credit worthy custodians which include JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., Citibank N.A., BNY Mellon, BMO Harris N.A. and Euroclear Bank Brussels (for non-U.S. dollar deposits). Each clearing house employs (or will employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event that a single investment adviser or custodian becomes unable to fulfill its role, additional investment advisors or custodians are available as back-ups. Cross-Currency Margin Deposit RiskEach of our clearing houses, pursuant to their rules, may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting original margin deposits denominated in U.S. dollars to secure a Japanese Yen variation margin obligation). The risk exists that the value of the original margin currency provided to satisfy margin obligations declines in value resulting in an inability to make required variation margins in the appropriate currency. This risk is mitigated by applying a “haircut” to the original margin currency at a level sufficiently high enough to weather periods of high currency volatility. Cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Should the value of the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its original margin deposit on a same-day basis.Impact of Inflation We have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or to decline. In the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.",2023-12-30 20:40:50.884062
1571949,ICE,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.",2015,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading ""Forward Looking Statements"" at the beginning of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Item 1(A) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in Item 6 “Selected Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview We are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and data services for financial and commodity markets. We operate global marketplaces for trading and clearing a broad array of securities and derivatives contracts across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, interest rates, equities, equity derivatives, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. Our regulated exchanges include: futures exchanges in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Singapore and Europe, three securities exchanges and two equity options exchanges. We operate over-the-counter, or OTC, markets for physical energy and credit default swaps, or CDS. We also currently own or operate seven central counterparty clearing houses. Through our widely-distributed electronic trading, clearing and post-trade platforms, we bring together buyers and sellers by offering liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets, and a range of services to support market participants’ trading and risk management activities. Our business is conducted as a single reportable business segment, and substantially all of our identifiable assets are located in the United States, United Kingdom, Continental Europe, Israel, Canada and Singapore.Recent Developments NYSE Acquisition and Related TransactionsOn November 13, 2013, we completed our acquisition of 100% of NYSE for $11.1 billion, comprised of cash consideration of $2.7 billion and 42.4 million shares of our common stock, and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date. Refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on this acquisition.Initial Public Offering and Sale of EuronextOn June 24, 2014, we sold an aggregate 65.8 million shares of common stock of Euronext, representing 94% of all outstanding shares, in three transactions. The three transactions include our sale of 42.2 million shares of Euronext common stock in an initial public offering, or IPO, at €20 per share, 23.4 million shares of Euronext common stock to a group of European institutional investors at €19.20 per share, and 0.2 million shares of Euronext common stock to eligible Euronext employees at €16 per share. On December 9, 2014, we sold our remaining 4.2 million shares of Euronext common stock, representing 6% of the outstanding shares of Euronext, for €95 million ($118 million). We no longer hold any shares of Euronext stock and these four transactions generated an aggregate €1.5 billion ($2.1 billion) of net cash proceeds for us. The net cash proceeds received included cash of $220 million distributed from Euronext as part of the separation of Euronext from us. Euronext was comprised of the continental European-based exchanges acquired by us as part of the NYSE acquisition.Due to the sale of a controlling interest in Euronext in June 2014, we de-consolidated the assets and liabilities of Euronext as of the IPO date and included the financial results of Euronext in discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. See ""- Discontinued Operations"" below. We used the cash proceeds from the IPO and sale of Euronext shares to repay debt. See ""- Debt"" below. Also, refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual 43Report on Form 10-K, for more information on the IPO and sale of Euronext and the presentation of the results as discontinued operations. Liffe transition to ICE Futures EuropeWe successfully transitioned all of the Liffe futures and options contracts to ICE Futures Europe during the year ended December 31, 2014. These products are now made available for trading on ICE Futures Europe via the ICE trading platform. The clearing transition of the Liffe products to ICE Clear Europe was completed in July 2013. NYSE Technologies DivestituresNYSE previously operated a commercial technology business, NYSE Technologies, which offered transaction, data and infrastructure services, and managed solutions for market participants. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold NYFIX, Metabit and Wombat, three companies that comprised NYSE Technologies. These sales completed our previously announced intention to divest non-core NYSE Technologies assets. The results of NYFIX, Metabit and Wombat are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. See ""- Discontinued Operations"" below. We used the net cash proceeds from the sales to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on the sales and the presentation of the results as discontinued operations.Other AcquisitionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of Singapore Mercantile Exchange, or SMX, SuperDerivatives and True Office and acquired 75% of the outstanding common stock of Holland Clearing House, or HCH. SMX operated commodity futures markets and a clearing house in Singapore. SuperDerivatives is a leading provider of risk management analytics, financial market data and valuation services. True Office is a developer of interactive technology-driven training services used for compliance and risk management, sales training, customer support and professional development. HCH is a continental European clearing house. Refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on these acquisitions.

As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See “- Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures” below. 44•Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.494 billion, or 93%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to an increase of $1.461 billion in revenues, less transaction-based expenses, recognized relating to the inclusion of NYSE, including $1.669 billion in NYSE revenues, less transaction-based expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2014 versus $208 million in NYSE revenues, less transaction-based expenses, for the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013. Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $235 million, or 17%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to $208 million in revenues, less transaction-based expenses, recognized relating to the inclusion of NYSE subsequent to our acquisition on November 13, 2013. See “- Revenues” below for further information on the NYSE revenues as well as a discussion of the other changes in revenues. Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, exclude Euronext and NYSE Technologies revenues which are included in income from discontinued operations discussed below. •Total operating expenses increased $836 million, or 103%, for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to an increase of $756 million in expenses recognized relating to the inclusion of NYSE, net of integration costs ($1.007 billion in NYSE expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014, including $123 million in integration costs, versus $171 million in NYSE expenses for the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013, including $43 million in integration costs). Total operating expenses increased $272 million, or 51%, for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily due to $171 million in expenses recognized relating to the inclusion of NYSE subsequent to its acquisition on November 13, 2013. Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs also increased $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of NYSE (including $43 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs incurred directly at NYSE and included in the $171 million NYSE expense number discussed above). See “- Operating Expenses” below for further information on the NYSE expenses as well as a discussion of the other increases in expenses. Total operating expenses exclude Euronext and NYSE Technologies operating expenses which are included in income from discontinued operations discussed below. •Other income (expense), net includes a $4 million net gain on the remaining sale of our 6% ownership in Euronext and $25 million in equity income from our equity investment in the Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, during the year ended December 31, 2014. Other income (expense), net includes a $190 million impairment loss on our Cetip investment and a $51 million expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt during the year ended December 31, 2013. Other expense, net, also increased in each of the last two years primarily due to increases in our interest expense resulting from increases in our total debt outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013. The increases in the other expenses was partially offset by an increase in dividend income received relating to our investment in Cetip. See “- Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” below.•Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 include the results of Euronext and NYSE Technologies subsequent to the NYSE acquisition on November 13, 2013. See “- Discontinued Operations” below.Factors Affecting Our ResultsThe business environments in which we operate directly affect our results of operations. Our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors, including the level of trading activity in our markets, which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions; competition; price volatility; market share and the pace of industry consolidation; broad trends in the brokerage and finance industry; price levels and price volatility; the number and financial health of companies listed on NYSE’s cash markets; geopolitical events; weather and disasters; real and perceived supply and demand imbalances; availability of capital; changing technology in the financial services industry; and legislative and regulatory changes; among other factors. In particular, in recent years, the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants’ demand for speed, capacity and reliability, which requires continuing investment in technology; and increasing competition for market data revenues. Price volatility increases the need to hedge price risk and creates the need for the exchange of risk between market participants. Market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market’s strength. The maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing.The implementation of new regulations may impact participation in our markets. Generally, legislative and regulatory bodies in the United States and Europe have expressed increased concern regarding derivatives markets when underlying commodity prices rise. As a result, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes. In particular, many of the proposed changes are still being implemented, and final regulations have not yet been adopted or significant uncertainties and ambiguities remain around adopted regulations. In addition, many market participants are still determining how they will respond to these regulations. As a result, it is 45difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. However, it may possibly result in increased costs and the expenditure of significant resources. Low interest rates and uncertainty in the U.S. financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a slow economic recovery. Equity market indices became increasingly volatile in the later part of 2014. Economic uncertainty in the European Union may also continue to negatively affect global financial markets. In addition, economic uncertainty has continued to affect our clients’ activities, business models and technology spending over the last several years. We expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses. We have diversified our business so that we are less subject to the reduction in volatility, trading activity or participation in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 13% in 2012 to 39% in 2014. We continue to focus on our strategy to broaden and diversify our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives in connection with our acquisition of NYSE in order to mitigate these uncertainties.We also periodically make adjustments to our contract specifications. Changes to contracts are generally aimed at making the contracts more relevant to more customers and their evolving hedging needs or are required based on changes to the underlying commodity and may result in fluctuations in trading volume in the near term, with the objective of making the contract more relevant to our customers over the long term. In 2014, we transitioned our Gasoil contract to a low-sulphur Gasoil contract, and that transition was completed in January 2015. These and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results. Segment Reporting We previously operated as a single reportable business segment as of December 31, 2013, the ICE segment. As of March 31, 2014, we operated as two business segments, the ICE segment and the Euronext segment, which was reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviewed and operated the business. Following the IPO and de-consolidation of Euronext in June 2014, we reverted to one business segment as this is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviewed and operated the business as of June 30, 2014 and for all subsequent periods. 46RevenuesTotal revenues, less transaction-based expenses, exclude Euronext and NYSE Technologies revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. See ""- Discontinued Operations"" below. The following table presents our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, from continuing operations (in millions, except for percentages): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change 2013 2012 ChangeRevenues: Natural gas futures and options contracts $194 $206 (6)% $206 $242 (15)%Brent crude futures and options contracts 231 228 2 228 214 7Gasoil futures and options contracts 82 96 (15) 96 97 (1)Other oil futures and options contracts99 96 3 96 85 13Power futures and options contracts77 74 3 74 81 (8)Emissions and other energy futures and options contracts 71 71 — 71 81 (13)Sugar futures and options contracts 95 90 5 90 80 12Other agricultural and metals futures and options contracts96 82 18 82 75 8Interest rates futures and options contracts268 43 530 43 — n/aOther financial futures and options contracts128 43 199 43 38 11Credit default swaps 161 145 11 145 144 —U.S. cash equities and U.S. equity options1,462 159 820 159 — n/aOther 49 46 3 46 48 (1)Total transaction and clearing fees, net 3,013 1,379 118 1,379 1,185 16Data services fees 631 229 175 229 147 56Listing fees367 33 1,003 33 — n/aOther revenues 210 75 181 75 31 141Total revenues 4,221 1,716 146 1,716 1,363 26Transaction-based expenses 1,129 118 857 118 — n/aTotal revenues, less transaction-based expenses$3,092 $1,598 93 % $1,598 $1,363 17 %Transaction and Clearing Fees, netA majority of our revenue is derived from transaction and clearing fees. Our transaction and clearing fees are reported on a net basis, except for the transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives trading and clearing and, subsequent to our acquisition of NYSE on November 13, 2013, from our U.S. cash trading and U.S. equity options businesses. In our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing fees from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared. Revenues for per-contract fees are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract. The amount of our per-contract transaction and clearing fees will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, pricing, product mix and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume but not to the same degree due to product mix and pricing. See “- Factors Affecting Our Results” above.In our derivatives markets, following our acquisition of NYSE, we recognize transaction and clearing fee revenues from executing and clearing trades based on interest rate, agriculture and equity derivatives futures and options. Trading volume in European interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from expectations for changes in the level and term structure of short-term interest rates and in economic data, and trading in equity derivatives, including equity indexes and single stock futures, is primarily driven by volatility.We also receive transaction fee revenues from U.S. equity and equity options markets, including the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Arca, NYSE MKT and NYSE Amex Options. This revenue includes routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other market for execution. Our U.S. equities markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. These Section 31 fees are designed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. We (or OCC on our behalf), in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing fees in our 47consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the U.S. equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees which are included in transaction-based expenses in our consolidated statements of income. As a result, activity assessment fees and Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income. Activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. As of December 31, 2014, the accrued liability related to the un-remitted SEC Section 31 fees was $137 million.Certain energy futures and options volumes and related revenues have declined or remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013. These energy contracts include North American natural gas and power futures and options contracts and Gasoil futures and options contracts. Gasoil is a key refined oil products benchmark in Europe and Asia, which underwent transition to a new specification during 2014.Natural gas revenue declined 6% and volume declined 22% for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, and natural gas revenue declined 15% and volume declined 18% for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012. The relatively lower decreases in revenues, compared to the volume decreases, was driven by growth in European natural gas volume, which has a higher transaction fee as compared to the North American natural gas contract, where volume declined significantly year over year. Decreased North American natural gas volume was primarily due to continued low volatility and low price levels, which produced muted trading activity in comparison to the record volume levels established during the year ended December 31, 2012. In addition, moderate commodity demand due to muted economic growth, regulatory uncertainty and strong natural gas supply reduced the demand for trading and hedging during 2014 and 2013.In 2014, ICE Brent crude futures and options contracts produced the eighteenth consecutive year of record volume. The Brent crude futures contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants, including oil producing nations and multinational companies, to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption. Based on traded volume in our Brent and WTI crude futures contracts, we had 54%, 55% and 56% market share of the global crude futures contracts volume for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Other oil revenue and volume grew due to the launch of new global oil and refined product contracts as demand for clearing oil contracts rose. Power futures and options volumes decreased 11% for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, and decreased 8% for the year ended December 31, 2013, compared with the comparable period in 2012. The 3% increase in power futures and options revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to the volume decreases, were driven by increased European power volume, which has a higher transaction fee as compared to the North American power contract, where volume declined due to low price volatility. CDS trade execution revenues at Creditex and ICE Swap Trade were $64 million, $66 million and $78 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The notional value of the underlying CDS traded was $1.0 trillion, $904.4 billion and $1.1 trillion for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The CDS execution business remains muted due to financial reform implementation and a general lack of volatility in corporate credit markets.Total CDS clearing revenues at ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe were $97 million, $79 million and $66 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe cleared $13.7 trillion, $10.7 trillion and $10.2 trillion, respectively, of CDS notional value. CDS clearing activity by investment funds, asset managers, and other buy side market participants has continued to increase due to regulatory mandates, the expansion of products made available for clearing and the benefits derived from portfolio margining.Our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $631 million, $511 million and $372 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in the rebates is due primarily to the rebates relating to the addition of Liffe derivatives markets following the NYSE acquisition, an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts and an increase in the number of rebate programs.Selected Operating DataThe following table presents trading activity in our futures and options markets by commodity type based on the total number of contracts traded, as well as futures and options rate per contract (in millions, except for percentages and rate per contract amounts): 48 Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change 2013 2012 ChangeNumber of contracts traded: Natural gas futures and options 235 301 (22)% 301 365 (18)%Brent crude futures and options 174 169 3 169 157 8Gasoil futures and options 53 65 (17) 65 64 1Other oil futures and options69 64 8 64 51 24Power futures and options (1)28 31 (11) 31 34 (8)Emissions and other energy futures and options 10 10 (3) 10 11 (2)Sugar futures and options36 35 4 35 32 9Other agricultural and metals futures and options44 33 33 33 30 9Interest rates futures and options415 59 599 59 — n/aOther financial futures and options239 46 426 46 41 10Total 1,303 813 60 % 813 785 4 % Rate per contract: Energy futures and options rate per contract$1.33 $1.20 11 % $1.20 $1.21 (1)%Agricultural and metals futures and options rate per contract (2)$2.38 $2.53 (6)% $2.53 $2.50 1 %Interest rates and other financial futures and options rate per contract (2) $0.61 $0.69 (12)% $0.69 $0.95 (27)%(1) The North American monthly power futures and options contracts included in the table above (and in the open interest table below) have been adjusted for all periods presented to be sized in megawatts, which resulted in a larger post-conversion contract size for each futures and options contract, a decrease in volume of contracts traded and included in open interest, and a higher rate per contract. (2) Subsequent to our acquisition of NYSE on November 13, 2013, agricultural and metals and interest rates and other financial futures and options rates per contract include Liffe agricultural, metals, interest rates, U.S. equity derivatives and equity indexes products. Open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open — in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. The following table presents our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in millions, except for percentages).

Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges. Data Services Fees We generate revenues from the dissemination of our market data to a variety of users. Subscribers can obtain access to our market data services either directly or through third-party distributors. In our derivatives markets, market data fees primarily relate to subscription fees charged for user and license access from data vendors and from the end users, view only market data access, direct access services, terminal access, daily indexes and end of day reports. In addition, we provide a service in our derivatives markets to independently establish market price validation curves whereby participant companies subscribe to receive consensus market valuations. We earn user and license revenues that we receive from data vendors through the distribution of real-time and historical futures prices and other futures market data derived from trading in our futures markets. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $88 million, $62 million and $64 million, respectively, in market data user and license fees from data vendors. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $87 million, $85 million and $69 million, respectively, in market data access fees. We charge a market data access fee for access to our electronic platform and the increases for the last two years relate to more users and fee increases implemented in 2012 and 2013 related to enhanced data offerings. With the addition of Liffe's markets, we also offer real-time and historical futures prices and other futures market data in additional markets, including interest rate futures. 50Our data services fee revenues also increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 following our October 7, 2014 acquisition of SuperDerivatives, a leading provider of risk management analytics, financial market data and valuation services. We recognized $12 million in SuperDerivatives data services revenues during the year ended December 31, 2014, subsequent to our acquisition. The acquisition is intended to accelerate our multi-asset class clearing, risk management and market data strategy. We now earn data services fees relating to our U.S. equity market data services. We collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data products. Consortium-based data fees are dictated as part of the securities industry plans and charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. Consortium-based data revenues from the dissemination of market data (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of a formula set by the SEC under Regulation NMS. Last sale prices and quotes in New York Stock Exchange-listed, NYSE MKT-listed, and NYSE Arca-listed securities are disseminated through “Tape A” and “Tape B,” which constitute the majority of our U.S. revenues from consortium-based market data revenues. We also receive a share of the revenues from “Tape C,” which represents data related to trading of certain securities that are listed on Nasdaq. Our proprietary products make market data available to subscribers covering activity that takes place solely on our U.S. markets, independent of activity on other markets, and includes depth of book information, historical price information and corporate action information. We also offer NYSE Realtime Reference Prices, which allows internet and media organizations to buy real-time, last-sale market data from NYSE and provide it broadly and free of charge to the public.NYSE data services fees include fees from Secured Financial Transaction Infrastructure, or SFTI, which is a physical network infrastructure that connects our markets and other major market centers with numerous market participants in the United States and Europe and allows those participants to receive data feeds. SFTI is a redundant network that supports a range of NYSE services and third-party content and connects all NMS market centers in the United States. During the year ended December 31, 2014 and for the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013, we recognized data services fee revenues from NYSE derivative market data services, U.S. securities trading market data services and SFTI fees of $430 million and $57 million, respectively. Data services fee revenues exclude Euronext data services fee revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. See ""- Discontinued Operations"" below.Listing Fees Following our NYSE acquisition, we recognize listing fee revenues in our securities markets from two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our U.S. securities exchanges - listing fees and annual fees. Listing fees consist of two components: original listing fees and fees related to other corporate-related actions. Original listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. Original listing fees, however, are generally not applicable to companies that transfer to one of our U.S. securities exchanges from another market, except for companies transferring to NYSE MKT from the over-the-counter market. Other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be listed, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions, which are subject to a minimum and maximum fee.Original listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of nine years for NYSE and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE MKT. Other corporate action listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of six years for NYSE and three years for NYSE Arca and NYSE MKT. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet. We have determined that, at the time of our acquisition of NYSE, we did not have a legal performance obligation relating to these listing fees. Therefore, in connection with purchase accounting and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, we assigned a fair value of zero to the NYSE unamortized deferred revenue balances relating to the listing fees as of the acquisition date of November 13, 2013 (the historical original listing fees deferred revenue balance as of that date was $486 million). The listing fees unamortized deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2014 of $81 million relates to original and other corporate action listing fees incurred and billed and not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the November 13, 2013 acquisition through December 31, 2014.Annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of listed U.S. companies at the end of the prior year. Non-U.S. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the United States. Annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. Fees we receive from NYSE Governance Services are included in listing fee revenues. NYSE Governance Services is a leading provider of corporate governance, risk and compliance services to a diverse set of customers, including a number of those listed on the NYSE. The True Office acquisition is included in with NYSE Governance Services. Listing fees revenues exclude Euronext listing fee revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. See ""- Discontinued Operations"" below.51Other Revenues Prior to our acquisition of NYSE, other revenues related to various fees for services provided to our customers, including ICE Chat and ICE Options Analytics subscription fees, ICE Endex membership fees, agricultural grading and certification fees, regulatory penalties and fines, interest income on certain clearing margin deposits and, during 2013 it included Liffe clearing fees (Liffe clearing fees are now recorded in transaction and clearing revenues). Following our acquisition, other revenues also primarily include technology services revenues, fees for facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, listed company service fees, and designated market maker service fees.We recognized $163 million and $27 million in other revenues from NYSE for the year ended December 31, 2014 and for the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013, respectively. Other revenues exclude Euronext and NYSE Technologies other revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. See ""- Discontinued Operations"" below.In addition to the NYSE other revenues, the increase in other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2013, from the comparable period in 2012, is primarily due to revenues that we recorded following the WhenTech acquisition in September 2012 and the ICE Endex acquisition in March 2013, a reduction in the net interest paid to clearing members for their cash margin deposits at ICE Clear Europe and the fees that we recognized relating to the clearing services agreement for ICE Clear Europe to provide clearing services to NYSE Liffe from July 1, 2013 to November 12, 2013. The interest paid to clearing members is recorded as a reduction to other revenues. Effective January 1, 2013, ICE Clear Europe no longer pays clearing members basis points on certain cash margin deposits. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we have reclassified certain revenues in other revenues to data services fee revenues and to listing fee revenues. The revenues reclassified to data services fees include our SFTI network revenues and our colocation service revenues and were $202 million and $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The revenues reclassified to listing fees include our NYSE governance services revenues and were $30 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.Transaction-Based Expenses See “- Revenues - Transaction and Clearing Fees, net” above, for information on the Section 31 fees that are included in transaction-based expenses. We incur liquidity payments made to cash trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges that are included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our U.S. securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. Additionally, we include costs incurred due to erroneous trade execution within routing as transaction-based expenses. Furthermore, NYSE Arca incurs clearance, brokerage and related transaction expenses and per trade service fees paid to exchanges for trade execution. Section 31 fees and routing fees collected from customers are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on our revenue recognition policies.Operating Expenses Total operating expenses exclude Euronext and NYSE Technologies operating expenses, which are included in income from discontinued operations. See ""- Discontinued Operations"" below. The majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our financial performance, as discussed below. 52The following table presents our operating expenses (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change 2013 2012 ChangeCompensation and benefits $592 $302 97 % $302 $251 20%Technology and communication 188 63 199 63 46 37Professional services 181 54 234 54 33 63Rent and occupancy 78 39 101 39 19 102Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs 129 143 (10) 143 19 641Selling, general and administrative 143 51 180 51 37 39Depreciation and amortization 333 156 112 156 131 20Total operating expenses $1,644 $808 103 % $808 $536 51%We expect our operating expenses to decrease in the near term from the year ended December 31, 2014 operating expense level in connection with our integration of NYSE, and then to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with the growth of our business and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions and other investments.Compensation and benefits expenses Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and by fluctuations in the number of employees. Compensation and benefits expenses increased for the last two years primarily due to increases in employee headcount. Our employee headcount increased primarily due to the NYSE acquisition, internal hiring relating to the NYSE integration, our other acquisitions and hiring for clearing, technology, regulation and compliance. Headcount increased from 1,077 employees as of December 31, 2012 to 1,133 employees as of December 31, 2013 (excluding the NYSE employees), an increase of 5% compared to the prior year, and increased to 1,650 employees as of December 31, 2014 (excluding the NYSE employees), an increase of 46% compared to the prior year. As of December 31, 2014, we had 1,252 NYSE employees, compared to 3,099 NYSE employees as of December 31, 2013. The decrease in the NYSE employees during the year ended December 31, 2014 is primarily related to the reduction of the Euronext employees following the IPO on June 24, 2014, of which there were 1,049 Euronext employees as of December 31, 2013, the sale of NYSE Technologies and employee terminations in connection with the integration of NYSE. We recognized $290 million and $46 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to NYSE during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, subsequent to our acquisition on November 13, 2013.Non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $82 million, $56 million and $52 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving non-cash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above. We incurred non-NYSE related employee severance costs of $4 million, $7 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The higher employee severance during 2013 and 2012 primarily related to broker severance at Creditex and severance during 2012 relating to our closure of the ICE Futures U.S. open outcry trading floor. In addition, we recorded $99 million and $44 million in NYSE employee severance costs during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, with such costs included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below. Technology and Communication Expenses Technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity 53requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.Technology and communication expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of NYSE expenses following our acquisition, acquisitions and growth in various contract volumes. We recognized $132 million and $13 million in technology and communication expenses relating to NYSE during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Professional Services Expenses This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings. Professional services expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of NYSE expenses following our acquisition. We recognized $135 million and $23 million in professional services expenses relating to NYSE during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Professional services expenses also increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to costs incurred at ICE Futures Singapore as we transitioned the exchange and clearing infrastructures to our trading and clearing platforms, and professional fees incurred for EMIR implementation. The increases in professional services expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 were partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses during the fourth quarter of 2014 relating to a credit we received from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, and a reduction in expenses related to the termination of certain services agreements and related agreements, or SLAs, with Euronext.Financial, operational and sales practice oversight of the members of our U.S. securities exchanges is generally conducted by FINRA. In addition, FINRA performs the market surveillance and related enforcement functions for our U.S. securities exchanges, pursuant to an agreement with us, although our U.S. securities exchanges retain ultimate regulatory responsibility for the regulatory functions performed by FINRA under that agreement. FINRA charges our U.S. securities exchanges throughout the year based on their estimated costs for these services and then trues up the charge at year end to actual costs incurred. Based on the actual FINRA charges incurred to us during 2014 versus what we were accruing, we recorded a credit of $7 million during the fourth quarter of 2014. In January 2016, NYSE Regulation plans to take over market surveillance, investigation and enforcement functions for NYSE equity and options markets from FINRA. In connection with the Euronext IPO, Euronext and ICE entered into a series of SLAs to ensure that Euronext and ICE (including Liffe) had continuity in operating their respective businesses through the separation. The majority of the SLAs relating to Euronext operational support and transition services provided to Liffe until its transition to ICE Futures Europe were terminated in November 2014. Rent and Occupancy ExpensesThis expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in Atlanta, New York and London with smaller offices located throughout the world. Rent and occupancy expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of NYSE expenses following our acquisition. We recognized $56 million and $10 million in rent and occupancy expenses relating to NYSE during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively . Additionally, we incurred $7 million in duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs relating to the consolidation of multiple New York office locations that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2013.Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration CostsWe incurred $129 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily relating to our integration of NYSE and the acquisitions of SMX, SuperDerivatives, HCH and True Office. See ""- Recent Developments"" above. Of this amount, $6 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. The remaining $123 million was for NYSE integration costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the Euronext IPO and sale, costs incurred relating to the sale of NYSE Technologies, and professional services costs. 54We incurred $143 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of NYSE and ICE Endex. Of this amount, $97 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. The remaining $46 million was for NYSE integration costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the Euronext IPO, deal-related bonuses and professional services costs. We incurred acquisition-related transaction costs during the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily relating to our pending acquisitions of NYSE and ICE Endex and our acquisition of WhenTech.We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we will incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. See “- Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures” below.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses This expense relates to expenses from marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, taxes other than income taxes and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased the last two years, compared to the prior year, primarily due to the inclusion of NYSE expenses following our acquisition. We recognized $88 million and $11 million in selling, general and administrative expenses relating to NYSE during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily related to costs from our other acquisitions, due to an accrual made in anticipation of the outcome of certain regulatory proceedings, and increases in certain expenses related to taxes other than income taxes, travel and entertainment and insurance. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives, technology and the Russell licensing rights. This expense also includes amortization of internally developed and purchased software over their estimated useful lives. We recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on the Russell licensing agreement intangible assets, of $151 million, $76 million and $69 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increases during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 primarily relate to amortization expenses recorded on the NYSE intangible assets. We recognized $84 million and $10 million in amortization expenses on the NYSE intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively.We recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $182 million, $80 million and $62 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The increases during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 primarily relate to depreciation expenses recorded on the NYSE fixed assets. We recognized $98 million and $16 million in depreciation expenses on the NYSE fixed assets during the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Depreciation expenses also increased for each of the past two years primarily due to additional depreciation expenses recorded on increased fixed asset additions and capitalized internally developed software, including the building we purchased in Atlanta, Georgia in July 2013 for $38 million and real estate expenditures during 2014 relating to the Atlanta and New York headquarters. See “- Cash Flow - Investing Activities” below. 55Non-Operating Income (Expenses) Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change 2013 2012 ChangeOther income (expense): Interest expense $(96) $(56) 73 % $(56) $(39) 43%Other income (expense), net 55 (230) n/a (230) 2 n/aTotal other expense, net $(41) $(286) (85)% $(286) $(37) 666% Net income attributable to non-controlling interest $(35) $(16) 115 % $(16) $(10) 58%The increases in interest expense over the last two years are primarily due to an increase in the overall amount of debt outstanding during each of the periods, primarily relating to debt incurred for and from the NYSE acquisition. See “- Debt” below. We recognized interest and investment income of $7 million, $3 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Interest and investment income is recorded in other income and the increase primarily relates to an increase in our short-term investments during the year ended December 31, 2014. We account for our investment in Cetip as an available-for-sale investment and it is classified as a long-term investment in our consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded an impairment of our Cetip investment for $190 million, which was recorded as other expense. Refer to Note 5 to our consolidation financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on this impairment. We recognized dividend income received relating to our Cetip investment in other income, which was $23 million, $8 million and $5 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. On October 16, 2013, following the issuance of $1.4 billion in Senior Notes (as defined below), we prepaid our Private Senior Notes (as defined below) representing $400 million aggregate principal amount. In connection with the early payoff of the Private Senior Notes, we incurred $51 million in expenses, which was recorded as other expense during the year ended December 31, 2013. See “- Debt” below.In connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we obtained a 40% ownership in OCC and we recorded our investment in OCC as an equity method investment. We recognized $25 million in equity income related to this investment during the year ended December 31, 2014 as other income. For a description of this investment, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this Annual Report on Form 10-K and see ""- Future Capital Requirements"" below.We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $2 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense) and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods.On June 24, 2014, we sold 94% of all outstanding shares of Euronext in an IPO. On December 9, 2014, we sold the remaining 4.2 million shares of Euronext common stock, representing 6% of the outstanding shares of Euronext, for €95 million ($118 million), including a realized net gain of $4 million, which was recognized in other income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $4 million net gain included a stock price gain of $15 million based on the difference in the Euronext stock price from the IPO date to the date of sale on December 9, 2014, less $11 million in foreign currency translation losses relating to the decrease in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar during this same period of time. See “- Discontinued Operations” below.During the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred $3 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters, which were recorded as other expense.For consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as non-controlling interests. As of December 31, 2012, non-controlling interest related to the operating results of our CDS clearing subsidiaries in which non-ICE limited partners held a 45.5% net profit sharing interest. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we purchased 3% of the net profit sharing interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries from various non-ICE limited partners and the remaining non-ICE limited partners hold a 42.5% net profit sharing interest as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. In connection with our acquisition of NYSE, 56we have non-controlling interest related to various minority ownership interests held in our majority owned subsidiary, NYSE Amex Options. In connection with our 79% acquisition of the derivatives and spot gas business of the former APX-ENDEX in March 2013, Gasunie’s 21% ownership is included in the non-controlling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date. In connection with our 75% acquisition of HCH in December 2014, ABN AMRO Clearing Bank N.V.’s 25% ownership is included in the non-controlling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date. The increase in the net income attributable to non-controlling interests for the last two years, compared to the prior year, is primarily related to these new non-controlling interests and the increase in the CDS clearing revenues the last two years. See “- Revenues - Transaction and Clearing Fees” above. Income Tax Provision Consolidated income tax expense was $402 million, $184 million and $228 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the change in our pre-tax income and the change in our effective tax rate each year. Our effective tax rate was 29%, 37% and 29% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 2014 and 2012 are lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to favorable foreign tax rate differentials, partially offset by state income taxes. Favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower tax rates in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and various other lower tax jurisdictions. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 is higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the non-tax deductible impairment loss on the Cetip investment along with state income taxes and other items. Other items are primarily driven by non-tax deductible transaction costs relating to the NYSE acquisition. Discontinued OperationsDue to the sale of a controlling interest in Euronext and the sales of the three companies comprising NYSE Technologies (NYFIX, Metabit and Wombat), we de-consolidated the assets and liabilities of Euronext (as of the June 24, 2014 IPO date) and NYSE Technologies (as of the sales dates) and included the financial results of these entities in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements effective from the NYSE acquisition date of November 13, 2013. See ""- Recent Developments"" above and refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on our discontinued operations disclosures. The results below include external advisory costs and professional services costs related to the sales of Euronext and NYSE Technologies of $51 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which have been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. The results below also include deal-related compensation and severance costs related to the sales of Euronext and NYSE Technologies of $42 million and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which have also been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. Further, the income tax provision for discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily from the impact of certain foreign tax law changes that occurred after our acquisition of NYSE on Euronext's tax assets and liabilities.We used the cash proceeds from the sale of Euronext to repay debt. We used the net cash proceeds from the sale of NYSE Technologies to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. Results of discontinued operations were as follows for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):57 Year Ended December 31, 2014 Year Ended December 31, 2013Revenues: European equity derivatives futures and options contracts$45 $7European cash equities116 26Total transaction and clearing fees, net 161 33Market data fees 60 15Listing fees19 6Other revenues 112 25Total revenues 352 79Transaction-based expenses 5 3Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses347 76Compensation and benefits105 29Technology and communication31 6Professional services31 6Rent and occupancy12 4Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs103 22Selling, general, administrative16 4Depreciation and amortization16 5Total operating expenses314 76Operating income33 —Other income (expense), net5 (4)Income tax expense27 46Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax$11 $(50)The total assets and total liabilities of Euronext removed from our consolidated balance sheet as of June 24, 2014 were $2.9 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, including $2.3 billion in goodwill and other intangible assets. The $1.8 billion in Euronext net assets removed was net of the 6% investment in Euronext held by us valued at $114 million at the IPO date. On December 9, 2014, we sold the remaining shares of Euronext common stock for $118 million including a realized gain of $4 million, which was recognized in other income in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The total assets and total liabilities of NYSE Technologies removed from our consolidated balance sheet as of July 23, 2014 and September 19, 2014 were $214 million and $42 million, respectively, including $186 million in goodwill and other intangible assets. There was no gain or loss recognized on the Euronext IPO or on the sale of the NYSE Technologies companies, as any differences in the carrying value of these net assets was adjusted in the NYSE purchase price allocation. Quarterly Results of Operations The following quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of income data has been prepared on substantially the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations for the quarters presented. The historical results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for any future period. This unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly data should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

The consolidated statements of income data for Euronext, NYFIX, Metabit and Wombat for the periods subsequent to the acquisition of NYSE, through their disposition, are included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax. See “- Discontinued Operations” above.(2) For the first three quarters of 2014, we have reclassified Section 31 fees related to our U.S. equity options revenues to show them gross, with a corresponding offset in transaction-based expenses.(3) For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we have reclassified certain revenues in other revenues to data services fee revenues and to listing fee revenues. The revenues reclassified to data services fees include our SFTI network revenues and our colocation service revenues and the revenues reclassified to listing fees include our NYSE governance services revenues.(4) For the first three quarters of 2014, we have reclassified certain costs related to NYSE to better represent our views on operating expenses.(5) Other income (expense), net for the three months ended December 31, 2014 includes a net $4 million gain on the remaining sale of our 6% ownership in Euronext and $25 million in other income from our OCC equity method investment. Other expense, net for the three months ended December 31, 2013 includes a $190 million impairment loss on our Cetip investment and a $51 million expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt. See “- Non-Operating Income (Expense)” above.Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic 59acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases and the continued development of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures. In the future, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities, which we may be unable to do or to do on favorable terms. We used the cash proceeds from the Euronext IPO and sale to repay debt and we used the net cash proceeds from the sale of NYSE Technologies to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. See “- Recent Developments” above and “- Debt” and “- Future Capital Requirements” below.On November 13, 2013, we acquired NYSE in a stock and cash transaction. We paid cash consideration of $2.7 billion and issued an aggregate number of shares of common stock of 42.4 million shares to NYSE stockholders. The cash consideration was funded from cash on hand, $1.4 billion of net proceeds received in October 2013 in connection with our public offering and sale of Senior Notes and $400 million of borrowings under our Revolving Facility (as defined below). We refinanced the new borrowings under our Revolving Facility and the $450 million borrowed under the 364 Day Facility (as defined below) through the issuance of a commercial paper program. See “- Debt” below. Upon maturity of old issuances of commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. In order to mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain an undrawn backstop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program. In case we would not be able to issue new commercial paper, we could draw on the backstop revolving facility, which would result in higher interest expense. See ""- Debt"" below. Consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $652 million and $961 billion as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and short term investments were $1.2 billion and $74 million as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We had $379 million and $324 million in long-term investments as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and $626 million and $438 million in short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments as of December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with remaining maturity dates of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. We classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. Cash and investments that are not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and investments. The €969 million ($1.2 billion) in short-term investments as of December 31, 2014 represented euro-denominated term deposit investments at various banks each with a maturity date of June 25, 2015 to cover the maturity of the NYSE EUR Notes on June 30, 2015. See ""- Debt"" below. The increase in the long-term investments is due to an increase in our Cetip investment's fair value. The restricted cash and investments increase primarily related to a contribution to the ICE Clear U.S. guaranty fund as of January 1, 2014 in connection with ICE Clear U.S.’s recognition as a third party QCCP, cash escrow set aside for the SuperDerivatives acquisition and increases in the regulatory capital of ICE Clear Europe and ICE Futures Europe due to additional costs incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses. As of December 31, 2014, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was $426 million. While we consider our non-U.S. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the United States, any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both U.S. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for any non-U.S. tax credits. However, we do not have any current needs or foreseeable plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. We may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.Certain of these investments, with an original maturity of greater than three months, will be classified as available-for-sale in accordance with relevant accounting standards. Available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. We do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2012, we repurchased 3,231,484 shares and 416,858 shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $645 million and $53 million, respectively. These repurchases were completed under a stock repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors. The shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. We did not repurchase any shares during the year ended December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2014, the remaining board authorization permits repurchases of up to $405 million of our common stock with no fixed expiration date. 60In September 2014, we entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan permitting open market repurchases of our common stock based on certain parameters described in the trading plan. We expect to fund any remaining share repurchases with a combination of cash on hand, future cash flows and by borrowing under our credit facilities and our commercial paper program. The timing and extent of any future repurchases that are not made pursuant to the trading plan under Rule 10b5-1 are at our discretion and will depend upon market conditions, amount authorized by our board of directors, our stock price, our target debt ratio and corporate debt rating, and our strategic growth initiatives at that time. We may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time or may enter into a new Rule 10b5-1 trading plan in the future. In addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time.Cash Flow The following tables present the major components of net increases (decreases) in cash and cash equivalents (in millions): Year Ended December 31,2014 2013 2012Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities from continuing operations$1,463 $714 $733Investing activities from continuing operations36 (2,521) (118)Financing activities from continuing operations(1,673) 1,119 172Discontinued operations(114) 19 —Effect of exchange rate changes (21) 18 2Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $(309) $(651) $789Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital. Fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations is primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and, to a lesser extent, due to fluctuations in working capital. The $749 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily due to the $685 million increase in our net income from continuing operations, primarily relating to the increase of $435 million in net income from the inclusion of NYSE ($465 million in NYSE net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 versus $30 million in NYSE net income from continuing operations for the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013). See ""- Consolidated Financial Highlights"" above. Investing Activities Consolidated net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 primarily relates to cash paid for acquisitions, cash proceeds from the IPO and sale of Euronext and the sale of NYSE Technologies, purchases of term deposits and available-for-sale investments, increases in the restricted cash and investment balances, and capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. We paid cash for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $577 million, $2.2 billion and $18 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, primarily relating to the SuperDerivatives, SMX, HCH and True Office acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2014, the NYSE and ICE Endex acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2013 and the WhenTech acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2012. We received net cash proceeds from the IPO and sale of Euronext shares and the sale of NYSE Technologies of $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. See ""-Recent Developments"" above. We purchased $1.3 billion of term deposits and available-for-sale investments during the year ended December 31, 2014, of which €969 million ($1.2 billion) represented euro-denominated term deposit investments at various banks with a maturity date of June 25, 2015 to cover the maturity of the NYSE EUR Notes on June 30, 2015. Primarily for regulatory purposes, we purchased short-term available-for-sale investments of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2013. We had net increases in restricted cash and investments of $161 million, $75 million and $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The restricted cash increase in 2014 primarily related to a contribution to the ICE Clear U.S. guaranty fund as of January 1, 2014 in connection with ICE Clear U.S.’s status as a QCCP, cash escrow set aside for the SuperDerivatives acquisition, regulatory capital from HCH after our acquisition, and increases in the regulatory capital of ICE Clear Europe and ICE Futures Europe due to additional costs incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses. The restricted cash increase in 2013 primarily related to increases in the regulatory capital of ICE Futures Europe, ICE Clear Europe and ICE Futures U.S., resulting from adjustments to the regulatory capital calculations to no longer allow for certain deductions in the 61calculations of the six months of operating expenditures. The restricted cash increase in 2012 primarily related to mandated changes in the calculations of regulatory capital at ICE Futures Europe and ICE Clear Europe as well as additional costs incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses. Capital expenditures were $172 million, $134 million and $32 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $78 million, $45 million and $36 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms and clearing houses, the purchase of a corporate aircraft, the purchase of a building in Atlanta Georgia to serve as our headquarters and leasehold improvements associated with the new and renovated office spaces in Atlanta, New York and London. The software development expenditures primarily relate to the continued development and expansion of our electronic platforms and clearing houses.Financing Activities Consolidated net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relates to $552 million in net repayments of our debt facilities and commercial paper, $645 million in repurchases of common stock, $299 million in dividend and dividend equivalent payments to our shareholders, $129 million in purchases of subsidiary shares from non-controlling interest and $45 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises. See “- Debt” below for a discussion of the debt facilities and commercial paper.Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relates to $3.8 billion in borrowings under our debt facilities, partially offset by $2.5 billion in repayments under our debt facilities, $77 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock option exercises (including $52 million relating to treasury shares received for shares that vested for NYSE employees at the acquisition date), $75 million in dividend payments to our shareholders and a $49 million termination fee relating to the early payoff of debt. Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2012 primarily relates to $295 million in borrowings under our debt facilities, partially offset by $53 million in repurchases of common stock, $50 million in repayments under the debt facilities and $19 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock option exercises. Discontinued Operations Consolidated net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities from discontinued operating was $51 million, ($504 million) and $339 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $504 million in net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to $220 million of cash distributed from Euronext to us as part of the separation of Euronext from our remaining businesses and $262 million in cash retained by Euronext and removed from our balance sheet in the de-consolidation. The $339 million in net cash provided by financing activities relates to cash proceeds received from the issuance of debt by Euronext just prior to the IPO.Debt As of December 31, 2014, we have $4.3 billion in total debt, including $2.1 billion in short-term debt and $2.2 billion in long-term debt. Refer to note 9 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on our debt.2014 Credit Facility On April 3, 2014, we entered into a $3.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 2014 Credit Facility. The 2014 Credit Facility matures on April 3, 2019. No amounts were outstanding under the 2014 Credit Facility as of December 31, 2014. Of the $3.0 billion that is available for borrowing under the 2014 Credit Facility, $905 million is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our commercial paper program as of December 31, 2014 and $303 million is reserved for our clearing houses. The amount required to back stop the commercial paper program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2014 is available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes.Revolving Facility and Term Loan Facility (2011 Credit Facilities)In November 2011, we entered into senior unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $2.6 billion, or the 2011 Credit Facilities. The 2011 Credit Facilities consisted of (i) an aggregate $500 million five-year senior unsecured term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility, and (ii) an aggregate $2.1 billion five-year senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Facility. In October 2013, we borrowed $900 million under the Revolving Facility, of which $400 million was used to pay 62the cash portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of NYSE while the remaining $500 million was used to pay off the outstanding commercial paper obligations of NYSE, as well as to fund certain deal related fees and expenses. In December 2013, we repaid the $900 million borrowed under the Revolving Facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and with cash on hand. In connection with us entering into the 2014 Credit Facility on April 3, 2014, the 2011 Credit Facilities were terminated and the $367 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility was repaid through the issuance of new commercial paper. Private Senior Notes Simultaneous with entering into the 2011 Credit Facilities, we also entered into a note purchase agreement providing for the sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $200 million of our 4.13% Senior Notes, Tranche A, due November 9, 2018 and $200 million of our 4.69% Senior Notes, Tranche B, due November 9, 2021, or collectively, the Private Senior Notes. In October 2013, following the issuance of the Senior Notes, we prepaid the $400 million aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes. In connection with the early payoff of the Private Senior Notes, we incurred $51 million in expenses relating to a $49 million pre-payment to the Private Senior Notes investors and an associated $2 million write off of the related debt issuance costs. The $51 million expense was recorded as other expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2013. To fund the pre-payment of the Private Senior Notes and the associated pre-payment expenses, we borrowed $450 million in October 2013 under the 364 Day Facility. 364 Day FacilityIn July 2013, we entered into a $600 million 364 day senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 364 Day Facility. The 364 Day Facility was available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In October 2013, we borrowed $450 million under the 364 Day Facility to fund the pre-payment of the Private Senior Notes. In December 2013, we repaid the $450 million borrowed under the 364 Day Facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. In connection with us entering into the 2014 Credit Facility, the 364 Day Facility was terminated in April 2014, at which time no amounts were outstanding under the 364 Day Facility.Senior Notes In October 2013, we issued $600 million aggregate principal amount of 2.50% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due October 2018, or the 2018 Senior Notes, and $800 million aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due October 2023, or the 2023 Senior Notes, together with the 2018 Senior Notes, the Senior Notes. We used the net proceeds from the Senior Notes offering to finance, together with cash on hand and $400 million borrowed in October 2013 under the Revolving Facility, the $2.7 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of NYSE. NYSE NotesIn connection with the acquisition of NYSE, we assumed the outstanding NYSE debt instruments, which included $850 million of 2.0% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in October 2017, or the NYSE USD Notes, and €920 million ($1.1 billion) of 5.375% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in June 2015, or the NYSE EUR Notes, and together with the NYSE USD Notes, the NYSE Notes. Upon closing of the Euronext IPO, we elected to set aside sufficient euro-denominated cash from the proceeds to effectively pre-fund the maturity of the NYSE EUR Notes and the related final interest coupon payment, both due on June 30, 2015. In connection with this, in July 2014, we placed €969 million ($1.2 billion) of the cash proceeds from the Euronext IPO in term deposits at various banks each with a maturity date of June 25, 2015 to cover the €920 million ($1.1 billion) principal and the €49 million ($60 million) final interest coupon payment due on June 30, 2015. These deposits are classified as short-term investments in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. The balance of the cash proceeds received in connection with the Euronext IPO were converted to U.S. dollars and used to repay outstanding commercial paper. Commercial Paper ProgramIn December 2013, we entered into a U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program. The Commercial Paper Program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the 2014 Credit Facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (such as USD LIBOR). The fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense. As of December 31, 2014, the weighted average interest rate on the $905 million outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program was 0.26% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 24 days. We used the net proceeds from the notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program, along with cash on hand, to repay the $900 million borrowed under the Revolving Facility and the $450 million borrowed under the 364 Day Facility during the year ended December 31, 2013. We used net proceeds from notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2014 to repay the $367 million that was outstanding under the Term Loan Facility upon termination of the Term Loan Facility in April 2014, to fund certain of our acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock during the year ended December 31, 2014. We repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2014 using a 63combination of the cash proceeds received from the IPO and sale of Euronext, the sale of NYSE Technologies and cash flows from operations. Guarantees In connection with our acquisition of NYSE on November 13, 2013, ICE, Intercontinental Exchange Holdings, Inc. and NYSE established various guarantees to protect against structural subordination of each entities’ existing indebtedness. Each of Intercontinental Exchange Holdings, Inc. and NYSE are our wholly-owned subsidiaries, and each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of ICE’s Senior Notes and, following its establishment, the Commercial Paper Program. Similarly, ICE and Intercontinental Exchange Holdings, Inc. each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of the NYSE Notes. Finally, ICE and NYSE each fully and unconditionally guaranteed, on an unsecured and unsubordinated basis, the payment of principal, premium, if any, and interest of the 2011 Credit Facilities and the 364 Day Facility. All of the guarantees are joint and several with all other guarantees and indebtedness. ICE’s guarantees, as a standalone entity, will remain in place until each applicable debt obligation has been satisfied. Upon the termination of the 2011 Credit Facilities and the 364 Day Facility, Intercontinental Exchange Holdings, Inc.'s guarantees were no longer required and therefore Intercontinental Exchange Holdings, Inc.'s guarantees were automatically released in accordance with their terms on April 3, 2014. In connection with our entry into the 2014 Credit Facility, NYSE agreed to guarantee the 2014 Credit Facility as a subsidiary guarantor. For as long as NYSE remains a guarantor of the 2014 Credit Facility, it will remain a guarantor of the Senior Notes and the Commercial Paper Program. We expect that NYSE’s guarantee of the 2014 Credit Facility, the Senior Notes and the Commercial Paper Program will be released when the NYSE Notes have been repaid, as the 2014 Credit Facility provides that NYSE’s guarantee will be released in accordance with their terms if certain conditions are satisfied, including compliance with the covenant limiting the amount of indebtedness of non-obligor subsidiaries and an investment-grade credit rating.Committed RepoTo provide a tool to liquidate margin and guaranty fund deposits held in the form of high quality sovereign debt, ICE Clear Europe, ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear U.S. have entered into Committed Repurchase Agreement Facilities, or Committed Repo. Each of these clearing houses is seeking to increase both the amount and the number of counterparties to its existing Committed Repo facilities. As of December 31, 2014, ICE Clear Europe had $350 million in Committed Repo, ICE Clear Credit had $100 million and ICE Clear U.S. had $200 million. As of January 9, 2015, ICE Clear Europe increased its Committed Repo to $450 million and ICE Clear U.S. increased its Committed Repo to $250 million. The ICE Clear Europe Committed Repo is available in U.S. dollars, euro and pound sterling, the ICE Clear Credit Committed Repo is available in U.S. dollars and euro and the ICE Clear U.S. Committed Repo is available in U.S. dollars.The Committed Repo arrangements provide these three clearing houses with an additional liquidity tool that may be utilized in the event there is a need to convert high quality sovereign debt into cash on a same-day basis during a market disruption that makes it difficult to sell and settle such sovereign debt on a same-day basis.Multicurrency Payment FacilityICE Clear U.S. requires its clearing members to meet non-U.S. dollar payment obligations in the currency of the obligation. ICE Clear U.S. also accepts foreign currencies as collateral to satisfy original margin requirements for those contracts which are denominated in a foreign currency. In addition, in order to meet its obligation to make settlement payments in all relevant currencies, ICE Clear U.S. uses its own capital to purchase the relevant foreign currencies as determined by its daily liquidity calculations. In the event a clearing member were to fail to make payment in a non-USD currency, ICE Clear U.S. will use the applicable foreign currency posted to satisfy original margin requirements in addition to the applicable foreign currency held by ICE Clear U.S. in order to meet its settlement obligations in such currency. Future Capital Requirements Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our trading and clearing volume growth, strategic plans and acquisitions, required technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business, and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. We currently expect to make aggregate operational capital expenditures and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between $165 million and $175 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology and the continued expansion of our businesses. In addition, we currently expect between $70 million to $80 million in capital expenditures during 2015, on leasehold improvement expenditures, primarily associated with our NYSE headquarters in New York. 64Our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board or audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.65 per share per quarter of our common stock for an aggregate payout of $299 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents. On February 5, 2015, we announced a $0.65 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2015 with the dividend payable on March 31, 2015 to shareholders of record as of March 17, 2015 (the ex-dividend date will be March 13, 2015).As of December 31, 2014, we had $4.3 billion in outstanding debt. We currently have $3.0 billion available for borrowing under our 2014 Credit Facility. After factoring in the $905 million currently required to backstop the Commercial Paper Program and the $303 million reserved for our clearing houses as discussed above, $1.8 billion of our 2014 Credit Facility is currently available for general corporate purposes. See “- Debt” above. The 2014 Credit Facility and the Commercial Paper Program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources. In the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise the necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. However, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. We have used and intend to use the cash proceeds from the Euronext IPO to repay debt. We have used the net cash proceeds from the sales of NYFIX, Metabit and Wombat to invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments, return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases and repay debt. See “- Recent Developments” above.In connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we assumed NYSE’s pension plans covering its U.S. and certain European operations. The benefit accrual for the U.S. operations pension plan is frozen. Following the Euronext IPO in June 2014, there are no longer any NYSE European operations covered by the pension plans. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we contributed $51 million to our pension plans. Our practice is to fund our frozen defined benefit pension plan each year at a level above the minimum required contribution but within tax deductible limits. Based on actuarial projections, we estimate that a contribution of $10 million in 2015 will allow us to meet our funding goal. However, the actual contribution is contingent on the actual plan performance relative to assumptions.Prior to our acquisition, NYSE completed the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options, one of its two U.S. options exchanges, to seven external investors. Under the terms of the sale, the external investors have the option to require us to repurchase a portion of its equity interest on an annual basis over the course of five years, which began in 2011. We currently own 84% of NYSE Amex Options and the remaining 16% of the outstanding shares of NYSE Amex Options, currently valued at $125 million, can be put back to us by the external investors in 2015 and these shares are recorded as redeemable non-controlling interest as of December 31, 2014.We are obligated to contribute an aggregate of $100 million to the ICE Clear Credit guaranty fund and the ICE Clear Europe CDS guaranty fund and have already contributed $50 million to the ICE Clear Credit guaranty fund and $28 million to the ICE Clear Europe CDS guaranty fund as of December 31, 2014. We are obligated to contribute an additional $22 million to the ICE Clear Europe CDS guaranty fund as of October 7, 2015, two years from the launch of CDS client clearing at ICE Clear Europe. We own ICE Futures Europe, and in connection with the NYSE acquisition, LIFFE Administration and Management, or Liffe, both of which operate as U.K. Recognized Investment Exchanges. As U.K. Recognized Investment Exchanges, ICE Futures Europe and Liffe are required by the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom to restrict the use of the equivalent of six months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. As of December 31, 2014 the regulatory capital for ICE Futures Europe and Liffe was $57 million and $114 million, respectively. Such amounts are reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. In November 2014, we completed the transition of Liffe’s contracts to ICE Futures Europe. While Liffe still has a regulated status, we expect to apply for a de-recognition order in 2015, which will result in the release of the $114 million in regulatory capital and an increase in our cash and cash equivalents. At this time, we do not expect the regulatory capital at ICE Futures Europe to increase during 2015 from $57 million as this balance already takes into account the higher post-Liffe migration cost base. As a U.K. Recognized Clearing House, ICE Clear Europe is required by the Bank of England in the United Kingdom to restrict the use of the equivalent of six months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. As of December 31, 2014, this amount for ICE Clear Europe was $87 million and is reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2014. When EMIR becomes effective, which is currently anticipated during the first half of 2015, the Bank of England restricted cash capital requirements for ICE Clear Europe will be superseded by the EMIR capital requirements, which would require an increase in the liquid regulatory capital requirements of $136 million. We also expect ICE Clear Europe's regulatory capital to increase by an additional $45 million to $50 million during the second quarter of 2015 in connection with the growth of our clearing business and costs at ICE Clear Europe. These regulatory capital increases will be satisfied by way of additional restricted cash through our cash on hand.65In connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we obtained a 40% ownership in OCC. OCC serves as a clearing house for securities options, security futures, commodity futures and options on futures traded on various independent exchanges. OCC clears securities options traded on NYSE Arca and NYSE MKT. OCC is regulated by the SEC as a registered clearing agency and by the CFTC as a derivatives clearing organization. OCC is developing a new capital plan, which is scheduled to be finalized during the first quarter of 2015, subject to regulatory and OCC shareholders’ approvals, which would potentially raise $150 million in equity capital from OCC's shareholders, including $60 million to be contributed by NYSE. In exchange for the equity capital from its shareholders, OCC would, subject to determination by its board of directors and compliance with legal requirements, commit to pay an annual dividend to its shareholders equal to the after-tax income of OCC, in excess of the amount required to maintain its target capital requirement and satisfy other capital requirements, and after refunds to its clearing members equal to 50% of distributable earnings before tax. In addition, under the OCC new capital plan, the OCC shareholders would commit to contribute up to $200 million in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by NYSE. Unless and until such $200 million capital contribution is repaid to the shareholders, OCC would not declare any dividends and would not pay refunds to its clearing members. See “- Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” above.Non-U.S. GAAP Financial Measures We use non-U.S. GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than U.S. GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-U.S. GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We strongly recommend that investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.Adjusted total operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted income from continuing operations, adjusted net income attributable to ICE and adjusted earnings per share for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below, which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, and their related income tax effect (in millions, except per share amounts): 66 Year Ended December 31, Three Months Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses$3,092 $1,598 $1,363 $800 $536 $324Total operating expenses1,644 808 536 400 373 131Less: NYSE transaction and integration costs and banker success fees 124 140 9 27 109 9Less: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles131 56 50 33 20 13Less: Duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs— 7 — — — —Adjusted total operating expenses$1,389 $605 $477 $340 $244 $109Operating income$1,448 $790 $827 $400 $163 $193Adjusted operating income$1,703 $993 $886 $460 $292 $215Operating margin47% 49% 61% 50% 30% 60%Adjusted operating margin55% 62% 65% 58% 54% 66% Income (loss) from continuing operations$1,005 $320 $562 $294 $(120) $133Add: Cetip impairment loss— 190 — — 190 —Add: Early payoff of outstanding debt— 51 — — 51 —Add: NYSE transaction and integration costs and banker success fees 124 140 9 27 109 9Add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles131 56 50 33 20 13Add: Duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs— 7 — — — —Less: Net gain on the sale of 6% remaining ownership in Euronext(4) — — (4) — —Less: Other income from OCC equity investment(26) — — (26) — —Less: Income tax effect related to the items above(91) (85) (23) (24) (53) (8)Less: Net income from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interest(35) (16) (10) (6) (6) (3)Adjusted income from continuing operations$1,104 $663 $588 $294 $191 $144 Net income (loss) attributable to ICE $981 $254 $552 $288 $(176) $130Add: Cetip impairment loss— 190 — — 190 —Add: Early payoff of outstanding debt— 51 — — 51 —Add: NYSE transaction and integration costs and banker success fees 124 140 9 27 109 9Add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles131 56 50 33 20 13Add: Duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs— 7 — — — —Less: Net gain on the sale of 6% remaining ownership in Euronext(4) — — (4) — —Less: Other income from OCC equity investment(26) — — (26) — —Less: Income tax effect related to the items above(91) (85) (23) (24) (53) (8)Adjusted net income attributable to ICE $1,115 $613 $588 $294 $141 $144 Basic earnings (loss) per share attributable to ICE common shareholders: Continuing operations$8.50 $3.88 $7.59 $2.56 $(1.32) $1.78Discontinued operations0.10 (0.64) — — (0.53) —Basic earnings per share$8.60 $3.24 $7.59 $2.56 $(1.85) $1.78Diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to ICE common shareholders: Continuing operations$8.46 $3.84 $7.52 $2.54 $(1.31) $1.76Discontinued operations0.09 (0.63) — — (0.52) —Diluted earnings per share$8.55 $3.21 $7.52 $2.54 $(1.83) $1.76 Adjusted basic earnings (loss) per share attributable to ICE common shareholders: Continuing operations$9.67 $8.45 8.08 $2.60 $2.02 $1.97Discontinued operations0.10 (0.64) — — (0.52) —Adjusted basic earnings per share$9.77 $7.81 $8.08 $2.60 $1.50 $1.97Adjusted diluted earnings (loss) per share attributable to ICE common shareholders: Continuing operations$9.63 $8.38 $8.01 $2.59 $2.00 $1.95Discontinued operations0.09 (0.63) — — (0.52) —Adjusted diluted earnings per share$9.72 $7.75 $8.01 $2.59 $1.48 $1.95We include acquisition-related transaction costs as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. However, we are including all of the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to our acquisition of NYSE as non-U.S. GAAP adjustments given the size of the acquisition, 67including a loss of $4 million for the year ended December 31, 2014 in connection with pension plan settlements made for early termination lump-sum payments made in 2014. We are also showing as non-U.S. GAAP adjustments our amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and cash operating results. During the year and three months ended December 31, 2014, in addition to the adjustments for the NYSE acquisition-related integration costs and the amortization of the acquisition-related intangibles, we also include as adjustments the net gain on the sale of our 6% remaining ownership in Euronext and the income recognized on our OCC equity investment. During the year and three months ended December 31, 2013, in addition to the adjustments for the NYSE acquisition-related transaction and integration costs and the amortization of the acquisition-related intangibles, we also include as adjustments the impairment loss recorded on our equity investment in Cetip, the banker success fee relating to the acquisition of ICE Endex, the expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt, the impact of certain foreign tax law changes that occurred during the fourth quarter of 2013 and the duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs we incurred as we consolidated multiple New York office locations in the current year. During the year and three months ended December 31, 2012, we include as adjustments the NYSE acquisition-related transaction costs and amortization of the acquisition-related intangibles. For additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and “- Operating Expenses” and “-Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” above.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table presents, for the periods indicated, our contractual obligations (which we intend to fund from operations) and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2014 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 YearsContractual Obligations: Short-term and long-term debt and interest $4,752 $2,167 $978 $679 $928Russell licensing agreement (minimum annual payments) 55 20 35 — —Additional funding of ICE Clear Europe's guaranty fund under EMIR and other regulatory requirements186 186 — — —Commitment to fund ICE Clear Europe's CDS guaranty fund22 22 — — —Operating lease obligations 423 58 94 75 196Other liabilities and commitments 11 5 6 — —Total contractual cash obligations $5,449 $2,458 $1,113 $754 $1,124We have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above $47.5 billion in cash margin deposits and guaranty fund liabilities. Clearing members of ICE Clear Europe, ICE Clear U.S., ICE Clear Credit, ICE Clear Canada, TCC and HCH are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. The cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits and guaranty funds’ liabilities. We have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or UTBs, from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above. As of December 31, 2014, our cumulative UTBs were $145 million. Interest and penalties related to UTBs were $45 million as of December 31, 2014. We are under continuous examination by various tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict, the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. It is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our UTBs. 68As of December 31, 2014, in connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs. Prior to our acquisition, NYSE completed the sale of a significant equity interest in NYSE Amex Options, one of its two U.S. options exchanges, to seven external investors. Under the terms of the sale, the external investors have the option to require us to repurchase a portion of their equity interest on an annual basis over the course of five years, which began in 2011. Since the likelihood of us acquiring the non-controlling interest in the future is probable, the full redemption fair value has been recorded as mezzanine equity and we have classified the related balance as “redeemable non-controlling interest” in our consolidated balance sheet. We currently own 84% of NYSE Amex Options and the remaining 16% of the outstanding shares of NYSE Amex Options, currently valued at $125 million, can be put back to us by the external investors in 2015 and these shares are recorded as redeemable non-controlling interest as of December 31, 2014. However, we cannot estimate whether the external investors will elect to exercise their remaining put options and it has been excluded from the table above. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the redeemable non-controlling interest.In connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we obtained a 40% ownership in OCC. OCC is developing a new capital plan, which is scheduled to be finalized during the first quarter of 2015, subject to OCC’s regulatory and OCC shareholders’ approvals, which would potentially raise $150 million in equity capital from OCC's shareholders, including $60 million to be contributed by NYSE. In addition, under the OCC new capital plan, the OCC shareholders would commit to contribute up to $200 million in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by NYSE. However, we cannot estimate whether the OCC new capital plan will be approved and for how much and the $60 million initial contribution and the potential $80 million additional contribution from us has been excluded from the table above. See “- Future Capital Requirements” above.New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to the accounting matters described below. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments. Based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. The values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets We have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use 69significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. As of December 31, 2014, we had goodwill of $8.5 billion and net other intangible assets of $7.8 billion relating to our acquisitions, our purchase of trademarks and Internet domain names from various third parties, and the Russell licensing agreement. Of these amounts, $6.1 billion in goodwill and $7.0 billion of other intangible assets relates to our acquisition of NYSE on November 13, 2013. We do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. In performing the purchase price allocation, we consider, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. At the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation. We continue to review and validate estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period. Accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. Subsequent to our acquisition of NYSE, we identified five reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our CDS reporting unit, our cash listings reporting unit, our Euronext reporting unit and our technology reporting unit. The cash listings, Euronext and technology reporting units were added as part of our NYSE acquisition on November 13, 2013. As a result of the IPO of Euronext and the sale of NYSE Technologies during the year ended December 31, 2014, we currently have three reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our CDS reporting unit and our cash listings reporting unit. Goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. The initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. However, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. For annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. Otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. For annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount. Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. These estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. Future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets through December 31, 2014. Among our reporting units, the fair value of our CDS reporting unit has been the closest to its carrying value in prior goodwill impairment analyses. Our CDS reporting unit includes the financial results and net assets of Creditex, ICE Clear Credit and the CDS clearing business at ICE Clear Europe. CDS trade execution revenues at Creditex have decreased the last several years. The CDS execution business remains pressured due to financial reform implementation and a general lack of volatility in the corporate credit markets. However, the decline in CDS trading revenues was offset by an increase in ICE CDS clearing, the listing of additional cleared CDS products, and signing on new clearing members, along with a decrease in expenses at Creditex. Also, with the advent of mandatory clearing during 2013, CDS clearing activity by investment funds, asset managers, and similar buy side market participants has increased significantly.70During the first step of the CDS impairment review in the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed a discounted cash flow valuation to estimate the fair value of our CDS reporting unit. The valuation of our CDS reporting unit concluded that the fair value exceeded carrying value by $751 million, or 132% of the carrying value in the fourth quarter of 2014. As of December 31, 2014, the CDS goodwill and other intangible assets balances were $476 million. The discount rate used in the CDS discounted cash flow valuation is intended to reflect the risks inherent in the future cash flows of the CDS reporting unit and was 9.2% in the fourth quarter 2014 review. A 10 basis point increase in the discount rate used would not have a material impact on our fair value of the CDS reporting unit. A 10% decrease in the estimated discounted cash flows for the CDS reporting unit would result in the fair value of the reporting unit exceeding the carrying value by $548 million. Given the current market conditions and continued economic and regulatory uncertainty, the fair value of our CDS reporting unit may deteriorate and could result in the need to record an impairment charge in future periods. We continue to monitor potential triggering events in our CDS reporting unit, including changes in the business and regulatory climate in which it operates, the current volatility in the capital markets, our recent operating performance and our financial projections. Any changes in these factors could result in an impairment charge. We are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. If an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. Fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis. Our evaluation has not resulted in any impairment of other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment through December 31, 2014. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse. We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. The undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been made in our consolidated financial statements. A distribution of these non-U.S. earnings in the form of dividends, or otherwise, could subject us to both U.S. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for non-U.S. tax credits, and withholding taxes payable to the various non-U.S. countries. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable. We operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 71Pension and Other Post-Retirement Employee Benefits In connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we assumed NYSE’s pension plans and other post-retirement employee benefit plans covering its U.S. and certain European operations. Following the Euronext IPO in June 2014, there are no longer any NYSE European operations covered by the pensions plans and other post-retirement employee benefit plans. Pension and other post-retirement employee benefits costs and liabilities are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts. These assumptions include discount rates to measure future obligation and interest expense, mortality rates, health care cost trend rates, benefits earned, interest cost, expected return on assets, and other factors. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other post-retirement obligations and future expense.ITEM 7 (A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments were $2.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of which $1.9 billion and $819 million, respectively, were denominated in Brazilian reais, pounds sterling, euros or Canadian dollars. Of the $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2014, €969 million ($1.2 billion) represents euro-denominated cash that was placed in term deposits at various banks with a maturity date of June 25, 2015 to cover the maturity of the NYSE EURO Notes on June 30, 2015. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Debt” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our investment in Cetip, which is recorded as an available-for-sale, long-term investment and was recorded in and is held in Brazilian reais, was valued at $379 million as of December 31, 2014, including an unrealized gain of $55 million. Changes in the fair value of the Cetip investment is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and do not impact earnings, except to the extent that unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary. The remaining investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. A hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $3 million as of December 31, 2014, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments. As of December 31, 2014, we had $4.3 billion in outstanding debt, of which $1.4 billion relates to the Senior Notes and $2.0 billion relates to the NYSE Notes, both of which bear interest at fixed interest rates. The remaining amount outstanding of $905 million relates to the Commercial Paper Program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2014 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $9 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. The interest rates on our Commercial Paper Program are currently reset on a daily, weekly or monthly basis. See Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Debt” included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk As an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in euros or pounds sterling. Certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. 72Our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the year ended December 31, 2014 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (in millions, except average rates and percentages): Year Ended December 31, 2014 Euro Pound SterlingAverage exchange rate to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2014$1.3300 $1.6481Average exchange rate to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2013$1.3282 $1.5643Average exchange rate increase in 2014 compared to 2013—% 5%Foreign denominated percentage of: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses5% 14%Operating expenses1% 17%Operating income9% 11%Impact of the currency fluctuations (1) on: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses$— $23Operating expenses$— $14Operating income$— $9(1)Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in the prior year.NYSE, which we acquired in November 2013, has a significant part of its assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. For the year ended December 31, 2014, 19% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 18% of our consolidated expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, respectively. These percentages do not include the Euronext revenues and expenses, as they are included in discontinued operations. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. We have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We had foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $2 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar, which strengthened. A 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2014 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $6 million, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity.We entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 as economic hedges to hedge a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. We have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. Our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): As of December 31, 2014 Position in euros Position in pounds sterlingAssets€1,633 £2,557 of which goodwill represents379 435Liabilities1,032 470of which borrowings represent965 —Net currency position€601 £2,087Impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates$73 $325The NYSE EUR Notes of €920 million ($1.1 billion) no longer constitute a partial hedge of NYSE’s net euro investment in foreign entities following the IPO of Euronext. The transaction gain or loss from the revaluation of the NYSE EUR Notes on the U.S. dollar balance sheet of NYSE Holdings LLC will be offset by the transaction gain or loss from the cash held in euros to repay the notes upon their maturity in June 2015, as discussed above.73As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive income from foreign currency translation was $13 million and $143 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2014, we had net exposure of euro and pounds sterling of €601 million ($731 million) and £2.1 billion ($3.2 billion), respectively. Based on December 31, 2014 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of euro against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $73 million and a hypothetical 10% decrease of pound sterling against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $325 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014, currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of $130 million on our consolidated equity.Credit Risk We are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. Our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. We seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.Clearing House Cash Deposits Credit RiskOur clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are invested primarily to provide security of capital, but also which may generate interest income for our clearing members. Refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for more information on the clearing houses cash deposits, which were $47.5 billion as of December 31, 2014. The following is a summary of the risks associated with this investment activity and how these risks are mitigated.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of the purchased security to decline. If we were required to sell the security prior to its maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the security might be made at a loss relative to its original purchase price. Our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making all of our cash deposit investments in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 1 to 37 days. Our clearing house investment guidelines require that a minimum of 50% of clearing member cash deposits are invested in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within one business day. Efforts are made to invest the remaining 50% in sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements that mature within 37 business days. If this is not possible, our policy allows for the investment of up to 50% of clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt (for example, U.S. Treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (Euro cash deposits only) with the shortest possible time to maturity provided that no such direct investment in a sovereign debt or supranational instrument will have a time to maturity greater than 397 days (1.09 years).Security Issuer RiskSecurity issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. This risk is mitigated by investing clearing member cash deposits in high quality sovereign debt reverse repurchase agreements or direct investments in high quality sovereign and supranational debt issues. Thus, the risk is mitigated because, in the event of a security issuer default, we are left with a highly marketable, liquid security.Investment Counterparty RiskInvestment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty or an investment adviser might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and investment advisors.When engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts that are under the control of our clearing house. Additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. The typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty’s obligation to our clearing house.Our clearing houses do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments with any of our investment advisors. Our clearing house property is held in custody accounts controlled by our clearing houses. Our clearing houses' property is 74held with credit worthy custodians which include JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., Citibank N.A., BNY Mellon, BMO Harris N.A. and Euroclear Bank Brussels (for non-U.S. dollar deposits). Each clearing house employs (or will employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event that a single investment adviser or custodian becomes unable to fulfill its role, additional investment advisors or custodians are available as back-ups. Cross-Currency Margin Deposit RiskEach of our clearing houses, pursuant to their rules, may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting original margin deposits denominated in U.S. dollars to secure a Japanese Yen variation margin obligation). The risk exists that the value of the original margin currency provided to satisfy margin obligations declines in value resulting in an inability to make required variation margins in the appropriate currency. This risk is mitigated by applying a “haircut” to the original margin currency at a level sufficiently high enough to weather periods of high currency volatility. Cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Should the value of the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its original margin deposit on a same-day basis.Impact of Inflation We have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or to decline. In the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.",2023-12-30 20:40:52.568119

The total purchase price was $5.6 billion, comprised of cash consideration of $4.1 billion and 6.5 million shares of our common stock, and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date. The cash consideration is gross of $301 million of cash held by Interactive Data on the date of the acquisition. The cash consideration was funded from $2.5 billion of net proceeds received on November 24, 2015 in connection with the offering of new senior notes and $1.6 billion of borrowing under our commercial paper program. Refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on this acquisition.Interactive Data is a leading provider of financial market data, analytics and related trading solutions, serving the mutual fund, bank, asset management, hedge fund, securities and financial instrument processing and administration sectors. The acquisition builds on our global market data growth strategy by expanding the markets served, adding technology platforms and increasing new data and valuation services. The combined company will offer customers efficiencies in accessing data on an integrated platform while serving the growing demand for data, analysis, valuation and connectivity globally.Trayport AcquisitionOn December 11, 2015, we acquired 100% of Trayport in a stock transaction. The total purchase price was $620 million, comprised of 2.5 million shares of our common stock, and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date. Refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on this acquisition.Trayport licenses its technology to serve brokers, exchanges and traders to facilitate electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the energy markets. The transaction is expected to enable us to provide new technology and software-related services to our energy customers. NYSE Acquisition and Related TransactionsOn November 13, 2013, we acquired 100% of NYSE for $11.1 billion, comprised of cash consideration of $2.7 billion and 42.4 million shares of our common stock, and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date. Refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on this acquisition.We successfully transitioned all of the Liffe futures and options contracts to ICE Futures Europe during the year ended December 31, 2014. These products are now made available for trading on ICE Futures Europe via the ICE trading platform. The clearing transition of the Liffe products to ICE Clear Europe was completed in July 2013. On June 24, 2014, we sold an aggregate 65.8 million shares of common stock of Euronext, representing 94% of all outstanding shares, in three transactions. The three transactions include our sale of 42.2 million shares of Euronext common stock in an initial public offering, or IPO, at €20 per share, 23.4 million shares of Euronext common stock to a group of European institutional investors at €19.20 per share, and 0.2 million shares of Euronext common stock to eligible Euronext employees at €16 per share. On December 9, 2014, we sold our remaining 4.2 million shares of Euronext common stock, representing 6% of the outstanding shares of Euronext, for €95 million ($118 million). We no longer hold any shares of Euronext stock and these four transactions generated an aggregate €1.5 billion ($2.1 billion) of net cash proceeds for us. The net cash proceeds received included cash of $220 million distributed from Euronext as part of the separation of Euronext from us. Euronext was comprised of continental European-based exchanges acquired by us as part of the NYSE acquisition.NYSE previously operated a commercial technology business, NYSE Technologies, which offered transaction, data and infrastructure services, and managed solutions for market participants. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold NYFIX, Metabit and Wombat, the three companies that comprised NYSE Technologies. These sales completed our previously announced intention to divest non-core NYSE Technologies assets. The results of Euronext, NYFIX, Metabit and Wombat are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. See “- Discontinued Operations” below. We used the net cash proceeds from the IPO and sales to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. See “- Debt” 39below. Also, refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the IPO and sales and the presentation of the results as discontinued operations.Other AcquisitionsDuring the year ended December 31, 2014, we acquired 100% of the outstanding common stock of ICE Futures Singapore (formerly Singapore Mercantile Exchange), SuperDerivatives and True Office and acquired 75% of the outstanding common stock of ICE Clear Netherlands (formerly Holland Clearing House). ICE Futures Singapore operates commodity futures markets and a clearing house in Singapore. SuperDerivatives is a leading provider of risk management analytics, financial market data and valuation services.

As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. •Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $246 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to increases in the data services fee revenues, listing fee revenues and Brent crude futures and options transaction and clearing revenues. The data services fee revenues increase was partially due to $50 million in data services fee revenues from Interactive Data and Trayport during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions in December 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreases in certain interest rate futures and options transaction and clearing revenues compared to the prior year periods. See “- Revenues” below for further information as well as a discussion of the other changes in revenues. Also offsetting the revenue increases were the impacts of a strengthening U.S. dollar on our foreign currency exchange rates (primarily for those revenues billed in pounds sterling and euros), which reduced our revenues by $55 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. See Item 3 “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.•Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.494 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to an increase of $1.461 billion in revenues, less transaction-based expenses, recognized relating to the inclusion of NYSE, including $1.669 billion in NYSE revenues, less transaction-based expenses, for the year ended December 31, 2014 versus $208 million in NYSE revenues, less transaction-based expenses, for the 40period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013. See “- Revenues” below for further information on the NYSE revenues as well as a discussion of the other changes in revenues. •Total operating expenses decreased $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to decreases in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs (related to lower NYSE integration costs, partially offset by Interactive Data and Trayport acquisition-related transaction costs) and decreases in professional services expenses (related to the reduction in professional services and contractors at NYSE). Operating expenses also decreased due to the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar on our foreign currency exchange rates (primarily for those operating expenses incurred in pounds sterling and euros), which reduced our operating expenses by $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. These decreases were partially offset by increases in depreciation expenses compared to the prior year periods primarily due to fixed asset additions relating to the NYSE integration and real estate expenditures relating primarily to the Atlanta and New York headquarters. We also had increases in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $41 million from Interactive Data and Trayport, subsequent to their acquisitions in December 2015. See “- Operating Expenses” below for further information as well as a discussion of the other changes in expenses. •Total operating expenses increased $836 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to $756 million in expenses recognized relating to the inclusion of NYSE, net of integration costs ($1.007 billion in NYSE expenses for the period ended December 31, 2014, including $123 million in integration costs, versus $171 million in NYSE expenses for the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013, including $43 million in integration costs). See “- Operating Expenses” below for further information on the NYSE expenses as well as a discussion of the other changes in expenses. •During the year ended December 31, 2015, other income (expense), net includes $15 million in various litigation settlements and accruals. During the year ended December 31, 2014, other income (expense), net includes $25 million in equity income from our equity investment in OCC. During the year ended December 31, 2013, other income (expense), net includes a $190 million impairment loss on our Cetip investment and a $51 million expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt. See “- Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” below. •The lower effective tax rate and income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future U.K. income tax rate reductions along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities. The higher effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily due to the non-tax deductible impairment loss on the Cetip investment. See “- Income Tax Provision” below.•Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 include the results of Euronext and NYSE Technologies subsequent to the NYSE acquisition on November 13, 2013 through their dispositions. See “- Discontinued Operations” below.Factors Affecting Our Results and Business and Market TrendsThe business environments in which we operate directly affect our results of operations. Our results have been and will continue to be affected by many factors, including market volatility and the level of trading activity in our markets, which during any period is significantly influenced by general market conditions; legislative and regulatory changes, as well as our fulfillment of our regulatory obligations; competition; demand for our data services and our market share; our system reliability; our ability to offer new products; our acquisition activities and the pace of industry consolidation; broad trends in the data and finance industry; the number and financial health of companies listed on our cash markets; geopolitical events; real and perceived supply and demand imbalances; changing technology in the financial services industry; and our reputation, among other factors. In particular, in recent years, the business environment has been characterized by increasing competition among global markets for trading volumes and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants’ demand for speed, capacity and reliability, which requires continuing investment in technology; and, increasing competition for market data revenues. Price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk. Market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market’s strength. The maintenance and growth of our revenues could also be impacted if we face increased pressure on pricing. The implementation of new regulations may impact participation in our markets. Many of the proposed changes with regard to global financial reform are still being determined and have yet to be implemented. In Europe, final regulations have not yet been adopted and significant uncertainties and ambiguities remain around such regulations. As this is established, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. However, it may possibly result in increased costs and the expenditure of significant 41resources. As discussed more fully in Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” included elsewhere in this Annual Report, the implementation of MiFID II and its counterpart EMIR, may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.Low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a slow global economic recovery. Equity market indices became increasingly volatile in the second half of 2015. Economic uncertainty in the Asia and the European Union may also continue to negatively affect global financial markets. In addition, economic uncertainty has continued to affect our clients’ activities, business models and investment over the last several years. We expect that all of these factors will continue to impact our businesses. We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility, trading activity or participation in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 13% in 2012 to 44% in 2015. This non-transaction revenue includes data and listings, and will continue to increase as a percent of our total revenue with the addition of Interactive Data and Trayport revenues reflected in our full year results. We continue to focus on our strategy to grow our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties.In recent years, financial institutions globally have acted to control or reduce spending, including spending on financial information and related services. Yet many of the data products and services we sell are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. While we expect that cost reduction and cost containment pressures will continue, we anticipate that there will be overall growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: increasing U.S. and global regulatory demands; investor demands for transparency; greater use of fair value accounting standards; greater emphasis on risk management; market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; the move to passive investing and indexation; ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; increased electronification of fixed income markets; and increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions. We contract with clients through data fixed-fee subscriptions (on either a multi-year, annual, quarterly or monthly basis), variable fees based on usage or a combination of fixed-fee subscription and usage-based fees. In addition, some of our data services generate one-time or non-recurring revenue, such as one-time purchases of historical data, set-up services or implementation fees.Interactive Data's pricing and reference data business grew in 2015 primarily due to expansion in North America and Europe. Growth was driven by strong revenue retention rates; increased demand from existing clients and, to a lesser extent, new clients; contributions from recently launched products; and the effect of price increases. Quarterly revenue retention rates for the pricing and reference data business, which is calculated as 100% less the dollar magnitude of cancellations (including revenue declines from continuing customers related to service downgrades, renegotiations, price reductions and usage declines) received during the prior 12 months divided by the annualized quarterly revenue at the beginning of that same 12-month period, have averaged 94% since 2007, and were 95% for 2015. 42RevenuesTotal revenues, less transaction-based expenses, exclude revenues related to discontinued operations for the years ended, December 31, 2015, December 31, 2014 and 2013. See “- Discontinued Operations” below. The following table presents our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, from continuing operations (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Change 2014 2013 ChangeRevenues: Brent crude futures and options contracts $263 $231 13 % $231 $228 2 %Interest rates futures and options contracts206 268 (24) 268 43 530Natural gas futures and options contracts 199 194 3 194 206 (6)Other oil futures and options contracts112 99 14 99 96 3Gasoil futures and options contracts 93 82 14 82 96 (15)Power futures and options contracts79 77 3 77 74 3Emissions and other energy futures and options contracts 58 71 (17) 71 71 —Sugar futures and options contracts 110 95 16 95 90 5Other agricultural and metals futures and options contracts101 96 6 96 82 18Other financial futures and options contracts136 128 5 128 43 199Credit default swaps 149 161 (7) 161 145 11U.S. cash equities and U.S. equity options1,676 1,593 5 1,593 173 1,076Other 46 49 (6) 49 46 3Total transaction and clearing fees, net 3,228 3,144 3 3,144 1,393 126Data services fees 871 691 26 691 246 181Listing fees405 367 10 367 33 1,003Other revenues 178 150 18 150 58 161Total revenues 4,682 4,352 8 4,352 1,730 152Transaction-based expenses 1,344 1,260 7 1,260 132 855Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses$3,338 $3,092 8 % $3,092 $1,598 93 %Transaction and Clearing FeesOur transaction and clearing fees are reported on a net basis, except for the transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives trading and clearing and from our U.S. cash trading and equity options businesses. In our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing fees from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared. We receive transaction fee revenues from U.S. equity and equity options markets through the New York Stock Exchange, NYSE Arca, NYSE MKT, NYSE Amex Options and NYSE Arca Options, including routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution. Revenues per-contract are driven by the number of trades executed and fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. The amount of our per-contract transaction and clearing fees will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, product mix and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing fees are assessed on a per-contract or notional value basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume but not to the same degree due to product mix and pricing. See “- Factors Affecting Our Results” above.In 2015, ICE Brent crude futures and options contracts produced the nineteenth consecutive year of record volume. The Brent crude futures contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants, including oil producing nations and multinational companies, to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption. Brent crude futures and options volume increased 14% for year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to increased volatility in oil prices following price declines and the continuing uncertainty around supply, demand and storage. Based on traded volume in our Brent and WTI crude futures contracts, we had 49%, 54% and 55% market share of the global crude futures contracts volume for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. While total oil volume and revenues increased during 2015, 43global crude market share declined due to greater volatility in WTI crude oil prices relative to Brent crude oil prices, which drove more trading by non-commercial firms in WTI. We receive transaction and clearing fee revenues from executing and clearing trades on European interest rate futures and options and additional agriculture and equity derivatives futures and options. Trading volume in European interest rate products is primarily driven by volatility resulting from expectations for changes in the level and term structure of short-term interest rates and in economic data, and trading in equity derivatives, including equity indexes and single stock futures, is primarily driven by volatility. Interest rate futures and options volume decreased 11% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to the low interest rate environment and the associated low volatility of the prevailing zero-interest rate policy in the European Union. Natural gas revenue increased 3% and volume declined 4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, and natural gas revenue declined 6% and volume declined 22% for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013. The revenue increase in 2015 and the relatively lower decrease in revenue in 2014, compared to the volume decreases, was driven by growth in European natural gas volume, which has a higher transaction fee as compared to the North American natural gas contract, where volume declined year over year. Decreased North American natural gas volume was primarily due to continued low volatility and low price levels, which produced muted trading activity in comparison to the year ended December 31, 2013. In addition, moderate commodity demand due to muted economic growth, regulatory uncertainty and strong natural gas supply reduced the demand for trading and hedging during 2015 and 2014.ICE Gasoil is a key refined oil products benchmark in Europe and Asia, which completed its transition to a new gasoil specification in January 2015. Gasoil futures and options volumes increased 19% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, and decreased 17% for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013. The increase in volume during the year ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to greater price volatility associated with oil price volatility and following the transition to the low sulphur gasoil specification. The transition to the new gasoil specification helped contribute to the lower gasoil volumes during the year ended December 31, 2014. Other oil revenue and volume grew during the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to oil price volatility and the introduction of new oil products, as well as the increased use of clearing related to regulatory requirements. Sugar revenue and volume grew during the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to price volatility and currency volatility in key currencies. Price volatility was driven by prospects for a bigger than expected shortfall of sugar production after several seasons of surplus. Also, forecast for a stronger than expected El Nino impact are generating uncertainty over sugar production estimates.CDS clearing revenues for ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe were $101 million, $97 million and $79 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe cleared $11.9 trillion, $13.7 trillion and $10.7 trillion, respectively, of CDS notional value. Buyside participation at ICE Clear Credit continues to grow by both U.S. and European buyside participants due to the availability of products and cost efficient margining in the U.S. relative to Europe.CDS trade execution revenues at Creditex and ICE Swap Trade were $49 million, $64 million and $66 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The notional value of the underlying CDS traded was $867.7 billion, $1.0 trillion and $904.4 billion for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. CDS trading remains muted due to financial reform implementation and lower volatility in corporate credit markets.U.S. cash equities handled volume increased 14% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to an increase in the total consolidated equities volume and an increase in our market share for the year ended December 31, 2015. U.S. cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $220 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, an increase of 17% from net U.S. cash equities revenues of $188 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. U.S. equity options volume decreased 20% for the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014, primarily due to the restructuring of the NYSE Amex Options business. Net U.S. equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $112 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, a decrease of 23% from net U.S. equity options revenues of $145 million for the year ended December 31, 2014. While revenues declined during 2015, the overall financial contribution of equity options was consistent with the prior year due to the retention of a higher percentage of profits from NYSE Amex Options driven by our repurchase of the equity in the exchange from the minority shareholders.44Our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $563 million, $466 million and $497 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in the rebates is due primarily to the rebates relating to the addition of European interest rate derivatives markets following the NYSE acquisition, an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts and an increase in the number of rebate programs. The level of rebates as a percentage of our total transaction and clearing fees has remained relatively consistent for the past several years.Selected Operating DataThe following table presents trading activity in our futures and options markets by commodity type based on the total number of contracts traded, as well as futures and options rate per contract (in millions, except for percentages and rate per contract amounts): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Change 2014 2013 ChangeNumber of contracts traded: Brent crude futures and options 197 174 14 % 174 169 3 %Interest rates futures and options370 415 (11) 415 59 599Natural gas futures and options 226 235 (4) 235 301 (22)Other oil futures and options86 69 24 69 64 8Gasoil futures and options 64 53 19 53 65 (17)Power futures and options29 28 2 28 31 (11)Emissions and other energy futures and options 9 10 (11) 10 10 (3)Sugar futures and options43 36 18 36 35 4Other agricultural and metals futures and options47 44 9 44 33 33Other financial futures and options115 114 1 114 46 146Total 1,186 1,178 1 % 1,178 813 45 % Rate per contract: Energy futures and options rate per contract$1.32 $1.32 — % $1.32 $1.20 10 %Interest rates and other financial futures and options rate per contract$0.67 $0.72 (6)% $0.72 $0.81 (11)%Agricultural and metals futures and options rate per contract$2.34 $2.38 (2)% $2.38 $2.53 (6)%The table above excludes European single stock equities in the other financial futures and options number of contracts traded and rate per contract amounts for all periods shown. The revenue associated with European single stock equities trading activity is capped and, therefore, there is very little correlation between volumes and revenue. Open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open — in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange.

Data Services Fees We generate revenues from a range of data services, including the dissemination of our market data, data analytics, delivery services and benchmark administration to a variety of customers. In our derivatives markets, data fees primarily relate to subscription fees charged for customer and license access from data vendors and from the end users, view only data access, direct access services, terminal access, daily indices, forward curves and other valuation services, and end of day reports. We earn data fees relating to our cash equity and options markets, and related data and network services. We also earn additional data services fee revenues following our recent acquisitions of SuperDerivatives, Interactive Data and Trayport.We earn data services fees relating to our U.S. equity market data services. We collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data products. Consortium-based data 47fees are dictated as part of the securities industry plans and charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. Consortium-based data revenues from the dissemination of market data (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating markets on the basis of a formula set by the SEC under Regulation NMS. Last sale prices and quotes in New York Stock Exchange-listed, NYSE MKT-listed, and NYSE Arca-listed securities are disseminated through “Tape A” and “Tape B,” which constitute the majority of our U.S. revenues from consortium-based market data revenues. Data services fee revenues exclude Euronext data services fee revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. See “- Discontinued Operations” below.Our data delivery services include our colocation and Secured Financial Transaction Infrastructure, or SFTI, network and provide timely, reliable and secure transmission of our data to customers. SFTI is a physical network infrastructure that connects our markets and other major market centers with numerous market participants in the U.S. and Europe and allows those participants to receive data feeds. SFTI is a redundant network that supports a range of NYSE services and third-party content and connects all NMS market centers in the U.S. We formed IBA to serve as an administrator of regulated benchmarks. IBA became the benchmark administrator of LIBOR in February 2014, the ICE Swap Rate (formerly ISDAFIX) in August 2014 and LBMA Gold Price in March 2015. IBA charges a license fee for usage, redistribution, trading/clearing and historical access for these benchmarks.We acquired SuperDerivatives on October 7, 2014. SuperDerivatives is a provider of risk management analytics, financial market data and valuation services. We acquired Interactive Data on December 14, 2015 and Trayport on December 11, 2015. Interactive Data is a provider of financial market data, analytics and related trading solutions, serving the mutual fund, bank, asset management, hedge fund, securities and financial instrument processing and administration sectors. Trayport is a software company that licenses its technology to serve exchanges, OTC brokers and traders to facilitate electronic and hybrid trade execution primary in the energy markets. Our data services fee revenues increased during the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to the addition of new users, increased usage by customers, expanded product offerings, fee increases and the addition of SuperDerivatives and IBA for all of 2015 and Interactive Data and Trayport subsequent to their acquisitions in December 2015. We recognized $50 million in combined data services revenues for Interactive Data and Trayport during the month of December 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions dates. Our data services fee revenues increased during the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to including NYSE's related data services revenues for the entire year in 2014, SuperDerivatives subsequent to its acquisition in 2014, and ICE Benchmark Administration subsequent to its formation in 2014. Listing Fees We recognize listing fee revenues in our securities markets from two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our U.S. cash equities exchanges - original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to other corporate-related actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. Initial listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of nine years for NYSE and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE MKT. Annual fees are charged based on the number of outstanding shares of listed U.S. companies at the end of the prior year. Non-U.S. companies pay fees based on the number of listed securities issued or held in the U.S. Annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. In addition, other corporate action related fees are paid by listed companies in connection with corporate actions involving the issuance of new shares to be listed, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Other corporate action related fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of six years for NYSE and three years for NYSE Arca and NYSE MKT. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet. We determined that, at the time of our acquisition of NYSE, we did not have a legal performance obligation relating to these listing fees. Therefore, in connection with purchase accounting and in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP, we assigned a fair value of zero to the NYSE unamortized deferred revenue balances relating to the listing fees as of the acquisition date of November 13, 2013 (the historical original listing fees deferred revenue balance as of that date was $486 million). The listing fees unamortized deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2015 of $109 million relates to original and other corporate action listing fees incurred and billed and not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the November 13, 2013 acquisition through December 31, 2015. Listing fees revenues exclude Euronext listing fee revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. See “- Discontinued Operations” below.48Fees we receive from NYSE Governance Services are included in listing fee revenues. NYSE Governance Services is a leading provider of corporate governance, risk and compliance services to a diverse set of customers, including a number of those listed on NYSE. The True Office acquisition is included in with NYSE Governance Services. Listing fee revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to the amortization of the original listing fees incurred since the acquisition of NYSE and due to additional annual listing fee revenue recognized due to these new customers.Other Revenues Other revenues relate to various fees for services provided to our customers, including fees for facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, ICE Endex membership fees, agricultural grading and certification fees, regulatory penalties and fines, and interest income on certain clearing margin deposits. The increase in other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to increases in the interest income recognized on certain clearing margin deposits and fees earned on non-cash collateral placed by clearing members primarily due to fee changes and increased clearing margin deposits. The increase in other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily due to the acquisition of NYSE. Other revenues exclude Euronext and NYSE Technologies other revenues, which are included in income from discontinued operations. See “- Discontinued Operations” below.Transaction-Based Expenses Our U.S. equities and options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees collected from customers are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are designed to recover the government's costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. We, in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing fees in our consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the U.S. equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees which are included in transaction-based expenses in our consolidated statements of income. As a result, activity assessment fees and Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income. Activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. As of December 31, 2015, the accrued liability related to the un-remitted SEC Section 31 fees was $116 million.We also incur liquidity payments made to cash and options trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges that are included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our U.S. securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on our revenue recognition policies.Operating Expenses Total operating expenses exclude operating expenses related to the discontinued operations. See “- Discontinued Operations” below. The majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our contract volume, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our financial performance, as discussed below. The following table presents our operating expenses from continuing operations (dollars in millions): 49 Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Change 2014 2013 ChangeCompensation and benefits $611 $592 3 % $592 $302 97 %Technology and communication 203 188 8 188 63 199Professional services 139 181 (23) 181 54 234Rent and occupancy 57 78 (27) 78 39 101Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs 88 129 (32) 129 143 (10)Selling, general and administrative 116 143 (19) 143 51 180Depreciation and amortization 374 333 12 333 156 112Total operating expenses $1,588 $1,644 (3)% $1,644 $808 103 %We expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with the acquisitions of Interactive Data and Trayport in December 2015 and growth of our business, and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions and other investments.Compensation and Benefits Expenses Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and by fluctuations in the number of employees. Compensation and benefits expenses increased for the last two years primarily due to increases in employee headcount. Our employee headcount increased primarily due to the NYSE, Interactive Data, Trayport and SuperDerivatives acquisitions, internal hiring relating to the NYSE integration, converting contractor roles to employees at NYSE, and hiring for clearing, technology, regulation and compliance. Headcount increased from 1,077 employees at December 31, 2012 to 2,879 employees as of December 31, 2013 (excluding the Euronext and NYSE Technologies employees), increased to 2,902 employees as of December 31, 2014, and increased to 5,549 employees as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, our employees include 2,617 employees relating to the Interactive Data and Trayport acquisitions and we recognized $17 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to these acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. The employee increases were partially offset by employee terminations during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 in connection with the integration of NYSE, as discussed below. Non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $111 million, $82 million and $56 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increases in non-cash compensation expenses primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving non-cash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above and the result of a greater restricted stock award value in the January 2015 annual award, primarily due to the issuance of more restricted stock awards to NYSE employees than in the same period in the prior year, and due to the earlier grant date of the annual performance-based restricted stock award in 2015 as compared to 2014. We also increased our compensation accruals for our 2015 employee cash bonus and non-cash performance-based restricted shares above the target levels based on the 2015 financial performance as compared to our budget and financial performance targets as set by our board of directors. We recorded $21 million, $99 million and $44 million in NYSE employee severance costs during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, with such costs included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below and primarily related to NYSE executive departures. In addition, we incurred non-acquisition related employee severance costs of $3 million, $4 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The higher employee severance during 2013 primarily related to broker severance at Creditex. Technology and Communication Expenses Technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity 50requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.We recognized $8 million in technology and communication expenses relating to Interactive Data and Trayport during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. Technology and communication expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of NYSE expenses following our acquisition and growth in various contract volumes. Professional Services Expenses This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings. Professional services expenses decreased for year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to the reduction in professional services and contractors at NYSE. We eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with full time employees at NYSE. This decrease was partially offset by $2 million in professional services expenses that we recognized relating to Interactive Data and Trayport during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. Professional services expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of NYSE expenses following our acquisition. Professional services expenses also increased for the year ended December 31, 2014 due to costs incurred at ICE Futures Singapore and ICE Clear Singapore as we transitioned the exchange and clearing infrastructures to our trading and clearing platforms, and professional fees incurred for EMIR implementation. The increases in professional services expenses during the year ended December 31, 2014 were partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses during the fourth quarter of 2014 relating to a credit we received from FINRA and a reduction in expenses related to the termination of certain services agreements and related agreements, or SLAs, with Euronext.In connection with the Euronext IPO, Euronext and ICE entered into a series of SLAs to ensure that Euronext and ICE (including Liffe) had continuity in operating their respective businesses through the separation. The majority of the SLAs relating to Euronext operational support and transition services provided to Liffe until its transition to ICE Futures Europe were terminated in November 2014. Rent and Occupancy ExpensesThis expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in and around Atlanta, New York, London and Boston with smaller offices located throughout the world. See Item 2 ""- Properties” above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property. Rent and occupancy expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to consolidation of our New York, Atlanta and London office locations. This decrease was partially offset by $1 million in rent and occupancy expenses that we recognized relating to Interactive Data and Trayport during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. Rent and occupancy expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of NYSE expenses following our acquisition. This increase was partially offset by $7 million in duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs relating to the consolidation of multiple New York office locations that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2013.Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration CostsWe incurred $88 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily relating to our acquisitions of Interactive Data and Trayport and the integration of NYSE. Of this amount, $46 million was primarily related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and other external costs directly related to the Interactive Data and Trayport acquisitions and to other transactions. We incurred $42 million for NYSE integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. We incurred $129 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of NYSE and the acquisitions of ICE Futures Singapore, SuperDerivatives, ICE Clear Netherlands and True Office. Of this amount, $6 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, 51accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. The remaining $123 million was for NYSE integration costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the Euronext IPO and sale, costs incurred relating to the sale of NYSE Technologies, and professional service costs. We incurred $143 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of NYSE and ICE Endex. Of this amount, $97 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. The remaining $46 million was for NYSE integration costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2013, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the Euronext IPO, deal-related bonuses and professional services costs. We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we will incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses This expense relates to expenses from marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, certain expenses related to non-income related taxes and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to a reduction in certain expenses related to non-income related taxes, travel-related expenses and certain regulatory proceedings compared to the prior year period. This decrease was partially offset by $1 million in selling, general and administrative expenses that we recognized relating to Interactive Data and Trayport during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily due to the inclusion of NYSE expenses following our acquisition. Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, primarily related to costs from our other acquisitions, due to an accrual made in anticipation of the outcome of certain regulatory proceedings, and increases in certain expenses related to non-income related taxes, travel and entertainment and insurance. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives, technology and the Russell licensing rights. This expense also includes amortization of internally developed and purchased software over their estimated useful lives. We recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on the Russell licensing agreement intangible assets, of $160 million, $151 million and $76 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily relating to amortization expenses recorded on the Interactive Data and Trayport intangible assets. We recognized $8 million in amortization expenses on the Interactive Data and Trayport intangible assets during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily related to amortization expenses recorded on the NYSE intangible assets, following our acquisition. We recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $213 million, $182 million and $80 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to fixed asset additions and capitalized internally developed software, including additions relating to the NYSE integration and real estate expenditures during 2015 and 2014 relating primarily to the Atlanta, New York and London headquarters. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2015 is also due to the depreciation expenses recorded on the Interactive Data and Trayport fixed assets. We recognized $2 million in depreciation expenses on the Interactive Data and Trayport fixed assets during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. The increase during the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily relating to depreciation expenses recorded on the NYSE fixed assets. Depreciation expenses also increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 due to additional depreciation 52expenses recorded on increased fixed asset additions and capitalized internally developed software, including the building we purchased in Atlanta, Georgia in July 2013 and real estate expenditures during 2014 relating to the Atlanta and New York headquarters. See “- Cash Flow - Investing Activities” below. Non-Operating Income (Expenses) Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Change 2014 2013 ChangeOther income (expense): Interest expense $(97) $(96) 1 % $(96) $(56) 73 %Other income (expense), net — 55 n/a 55 (230) n/aTotal other expense, net $(97) $(41) 134 % $(41) $(286) (85)% Net income attributable to non-controlling interest $(21) $(35) (39)% $(35) $(16) 115 %Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to $9 million in interest expense that we recognized relating to new debt we incurred for the Interactive Data acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2015. This increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 was offset due to the repayment of $1.0 billion in NYSE EUR Notes on June 30, 2015. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily due to an increase in the overall amount of debt outstanding relating to debt incurred for and from the NYSE acquisition. See note 9 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional information on our outstanding debt and debt facilities.In October 2013, following the issuance of $1.4 billion in senior notes, we prepaid our outstanding private senior notes representing $400 million aggregate principal amount. In connection with the early payoff of the private senior notes, we incurred $51 million in expenses, which was recorded as other expense during the year ended December 31, 2013. We account for our investment in Cetip as an available-for-sale investment and it is classified as a long-term investment in our consolidated balance sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recorded an impairment of our Cetip investment for $190 million, which was recorded as other expense. See note 5 to our consolidation financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on this impairment. We recognized dividend income received relating to our Cetip investment in other income, which was $16 million, $23 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. In connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we obtained a 40% ownership in OCC and we recorded our investment in OCC as an equity method investment. We recognized $6 million and $25 million in equity income related to this investment during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as other income. For additional information on this investment and a discussion of the decrease in equity income for 2015 versus 2014, see note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this Annual Report. We recognized interest and investment income of $6 million, $7 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Interest income is recorded in other income. The increases and decreases between periods relating to our interest income were primarily due to the interest income associated with the short-term euro-denominated term deposit investments discussed above. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $15 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters (net of insurance proceeds), including for the ATG/ATS arbitration proceeding, which was recorded in other expense. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this Annual Report, for additional information on the ATG/ATS arbitration proceeding. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we incurred $3 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters, which were recorded as other expense.We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $14 million, $2 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense) and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. See 53Item 7A “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information on these items.On June 24, 2014, we sold 94% of all outstanding shares of Euronext in an IPO. On December 9, 2014, we sold the remaining 4.2 million shares of Euronext common stock, representing 6% of the outstanding shares of Euronext, for €95 million ($118 million), including a realized net gain of $4 million, which was recognized in other income for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $4 million net gain included a stock price gain of $15 million based on the difference in the Euronext stock price from the IPO date to the date of sale on December 9, 2014, less $11 million in foreign currency translation losses relating to the decrease in the value of the euro relative to the U.S. dollar during this same period of time. See “- Discontinued Operations” below.For consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as non-controlling interests. As of December 31, 2012, non-controlling interest related to the operating results of our CDS clearing subsidiaries in which non-ICE limited partners held a 45.5% net profit sharing interest. During the year ended December 31, 2013, we purchased 3% of the net profit sharing interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries from various non-ICE limited partners and the remaining non-ICE limited partners currently hold a 42.5% net profit sharing interest. In connection with our 79% acquisition of the ICE Endex in March 2013, Gasunie’s 21% ownership is included in the non-controlling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date. In connection with our 75% acquisition of ICE Clear Netherlands in December 2014, ABN AMRO Clearing Bank N.V.’s 25% ownership is included in the non-controlling interest line subsequent to the acquisition date. In connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we had non-controlling interest related to various minority ownership interests held in our majority owned subsidiary, NYSE Amex Options. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we repurchased the remaining ownership of NYSE Amex Options from the minority owners. Effective from July 1, 2015, all of the profits from NYSE Amex Options are retained by us as we now own 100% of NYSE Amex Options. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this Annual Report, for additional information on NYSE Amex Options. The decrease in the net income attributable to non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to a decrease in the net income relating to the NYSE Amex Options minority ownership interest primarily due to the reduction in the minority ownership percentage. The increase in the net income attributable to non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily related to these new non-controlling interests discussed above and increases in CDS clearing revenues. Income Tax Provision Consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations was $358 million, $402 million and $184 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the change in our pre-tax income and the change in our effective tax rate each year. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 22%, 29% and 37% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 are lower than the statutory federal rate primarily due to favorable foreign tax rate differentials, partially offset by state income taxes. Favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower tax rates in the U.K., the Netherlands and various other lower tax jurisdictions than compared to the tax rates in the U.S. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the U.K. reduced the corporate income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective April 1, 2017 and to 18% effective April 1, 2020. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the year ended December 31, 2014, is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future U.K. income tax rate reductions along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 is higher than the statutory federal rate primarily due to the favorable foreign income tax rate differential being largely offset by the non-tax deductible impairment loss on the Cetip investment along with state income taxes. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this Annual Report, for additional information on these tax items. Discontinued OperationsDue to the sale of a controlling interest in Euronext and the sales of the three companies comprising NYSE Technologies (NYFIX, Metabit and Wombat), we de-consolidated the assets and liabilities of Euronext (as of the June 24, 2014 IPO date) and NYSE Technologies (as of the various sales dates) and included the financial results of these entities in discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements effective from the NYSE acquisition date of November 13, 2013. There was no gain or loss recognized on the Euronext IPO or on the sale of the NYSE Technologies companies, as any differences in the carrying value of these net assets was adjusted in the NYSE purchase price allocation. See “- Recent Developments” above and refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on our discontinued operations disclosures. 54The results below include external advisory costs and professional services costs related to the sales of Euronext and NYSE Technologies of $51 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which have been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. The results below also include deal-related compensation and severance costs related to the sales of Euronext and NYSE Technologies of $42 million and $19 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively, which have also been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. Further, the income tax provision for discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 is primarily from the impact of certain foreign tax law changes that occurred after our acquisition of NYSE on Euronext's tax assets and liabilities.We used the cash proceeds from the sale of Euronext to repay debt. We used the net cash proceeds from the sale of NYSE Technologies to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases.

See “- Discontinued Operations” above.(3) We have reclassified certain connectivity fees from other revenues to data services fee revenues for all periods presented above. (4) Other income (expense) for the three months ended June 30, 2015 includes $19 million in litigation settlements and accruals. Other income (expense) for the three months ended December 31, 2014 includes $25 million in other income from our OCC equity method investment. See “- Non-Operating Income (Expense)” above.(5) The decrease in the income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future U.K. income tax rate reductions along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities. See “- Income Tax Provision” above.Liquidity and Capital Resources We have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends to our shareholders and the continued development of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our 56outstanding debt as it matures. In the future, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities, which we may be unable to do or to do on favorable terms. We used the cash proceeds from the Euronext IPO and sale to repay debt and we used the net cash proceeds from the sale of select NYSE Technology businesses to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. See “- Recent Developments” above and “- Debt” and “- Future Capital Requirements” below.On December 14, 2015, we acquired Interactive Data in a stock and cash transaction. The total purchase price was $5.6 billion, comprised of cash consideration of $4.1 billion and 6.5 million shares of our common stock (the cash consideration is gross of $301 million of cash held by Interactive Data on the date of the acquisition). The cash consideration was funded from $2.5 billion of net proceeds received on November 24, 2015 in connection with the offering of new senior notes and $1.6 billion of borrowing under our commercial paper program. On December 11, 2015, we acquired Trayport in a stock transaction. The total purchase price was $620 million, comprised of 2.5 million shares of our common stock. On November 13, 2013, we acquired NYSE in a stock and cash transaction. We paid cash consideration of $2.7 billion and issued an aggregate number of shares of common stock of 42.4 million shares to NYSE stockholders. The cash consideration was funded from cash on hand, $1.4 billion of net proceeds received in October 2013 in connection with our sale of senior notes and $400 million of borrowings under our revolving facility. We refinanced the new borrowings under our revolving facility and $450 million borrowed under a 364 day facility through the issuance of a commercial paper program. Upon maturity of old issuances of commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. In order to mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain an undrawn back-stop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper program. In case we would not be able to issue new commercial paper, we could draw on the back-stop revolving facility, which would result in higher interest expense. Consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $627 million and $652 million as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and short term investments were $29 million and $1.2 billion as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We had $299 million and $379 million in long-term investments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and $920 million and $626 million in short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with remaining maturity dates of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. We classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. Cash and investments that are not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and investments. The €969 million ($1.2 billion) in short-term investments as of December 31, 2014 primarily represented euro-denominated term deposit investments at various banks each with a maturity date of June 25, 2015 to cover the maturity of the NYSE EUR Notes on June 30, 2015. The decrease in the long-term investments is due to a decrease in our Cetip investment's fair value. Refer to note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this Annual Report, for information on the increases in our restricted cash balances. As of December 31, 2015, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was $419 million. While we consider our non-U.S. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the U.S., any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both U.S. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for any non-U.S. tax credits. However, we do not have any current needs or foreseeable plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. We may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.Certain of these investments, with an original maturity of greater than three months, will be classified as available-for-sale in accordance with relevant accounting standards. Available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. We do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we repurchased 2,868,769 shares and 3,231,484 shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $660 million and $645 million, respectively. These repurchases were completed under a stock repurchase plan authorized by our board of directors. The shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. We did not repurchase any shares during the year ended December 31, 2013. As of December 31, 2015, the remaining board authorization permits 57repurchases of up to $137 million of our common stock with no fixed expiration date. See Part II, Item 5 “- Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities - Stock Repurchases” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information regarding our stock repurchases.Cash Flow The following tables present the major components of net increases (decreases) in cash and cash equivalents (in millions): Year Ended December 31,2015 2014 2013Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities from continuing operations$1,311 $1,463 $714Investing activities from continuing operations(3,298) 36 (2,521)Financing activities from continuing operations1,976 (1,673) 1,119Discontinued operations— (114) 19Effect of exchange rate changes (14) (21) 18Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $(25) $(309) $(651)Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital. Fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations is primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and due to fluctuations in working capital. The $152 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to normal changes in operating cash flow during the year and timing of repayment of accrued expenses, including an increase of $204 million in cash paid for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. The $749 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014, from the comparable period in 2013, is primarily due to the $685 million increase in our net income from continuing operations, primarily relating to the increase of $435 million in net income from the inclusion of NYSE ($465 million in NYSE net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 versus $30 million in NYSE net income from continuing operations for the period from November 13, 2013 to December 31, 2013). See “- Consolidated Financial Highlights” above. Investing Activities Consolidated net cash (used in) provided by investing activities from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 primarily relates to cash paid for acquisitions, cash proceeds from the IPO and sale of Euronext and NYSE Technologies, purchases/proceeds from the term deposits and available-for-sale investments, additional contribution to equity method investee, changes in the restricted cash and investment balances, and increases in the capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. We paid cash for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $3.8 billion, $577 million and $2.2 billion, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, relating to the Interactive Data acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2015, the SuperDerivatives, ICE Futures Singapore, ICE Clear Netherlands and True Office acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2014, and the NYSE and ICE Endex acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2013. We received net cash proceeds from the IPO and sale of Euronext shares and the sale of NYSE Technologies of $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. We paid cash of $60 million during the year ended December 31, 2015 relating to an additional investment in the OCC. See “- Recent Developments” above. We purchased euro-denominated term deposits of $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014 and we received proceeds from the euro-denominated terms deposits of $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015 relating to the repayments of the NYSE EUR Notes. See “- Non-Operating Income (Expense)” above for a discussion of the term deposits. The decrease in the value of the euro-denominated term notes is due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro during 2015. See Item 7(A) “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations. We had net increases in restricted cash and investments of $294 million, $161 million and $75 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The restricted cash increase in 2015 primarily related to additional cash that was put into our clearing houses to cover our financial resources, regulatory capital needs and for liquidity purposes. The restricted cash increase in 2014 primarily related to a contribution to the ICE Clear U.S. guaranty fund as of January 1, 2014 in connection with ICE 58Clear U.S.’s status as a QCCP, cash escrow set aside for the SuperDerivatives acquisition, regulatory capital from HCH after our acquisition, and increases in the regulatory capital of ICE Clear Europe and ICE Futures Europe due to additional costs incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses. The restricted cash increase in 2013 primarily related to increases in the regulatory capital of ICE Futures Europe, ICE Clear Europe and ICE Futures U.S., resulting from adjustments to the regulatory capital calculations to no longer allow for certain deductions in the calculations of the six months of operating expenditures.Capital expenditures were $190 million, $172 million and $134 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $87 million, $78 million and $45 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms and clearing houses, the purchase of corporate aircraft, the purchase of a building in Atlanta, Georgia to serve as our headquarters and leasehold improvements associated with the new and renovated office spaces in Atlanta, New York and London. The software development expenditures primarily relate to the continued development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms and clearing houses.Financing Activities Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily relates to $2.5 billion in net proceeds received in connection with the offering of new senior notes and $1.7 billion in net borrowings under our commercial paper program, partially offset by $1.0 billion in net repayments under our debt facilities, $660 million in repurchases of common stock, $331 million in dividend and dividend equivalent payments to our shareholders, $128 million for the purchase of subsidiary shares from non-controlling interest holders (for the purchase of the NYSE Amex Options shares) and $45 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises. See “- Debt” below.Consolidated net cash used by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relates to $552 million in net repayments of our debt facilities and commercial paper, $645 million in repurchases of common stock, $299 million in dividend and dividend equivalent payments to our shareholders, $129 million in purchases of subsidiary shares from non-controlling interest and $45 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises. Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2013 primarily relates to $3.8 billion in borrowings of our debt facilities and commercial paper, partially offset by $2.5 billion in repayments under out debt facilities, $77 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock option exercises (including $52 million relating to treasury shares received for shares that vested for NYSE employees at the acquisition date) and $75 million in dividend payments to our shareholders.Discontinued Operations We did not have any cash provided by or used in any activities from discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2015. Consolidated net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities from discontinued operations was $51 million, ($504 million) and $339 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $504 million in net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to $220 million of cash distributed from Euronext to us as part of the separation of Euronext from our remaining businesses and $262 million in cash retained by Euronext and removed from our balance sheet in the de-consolidation. The $339 million in net cash provided by financing activities relates to cash proceeds received from the issuance of debt by Euronext just prior to the IPO.Debt Our total debt, including short-term and long-term debt, consisted of the following as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 (in millions):59 As of December 31, 2015 2014Debt: Commercial Paper$2,591 $905NYSE EUR Notes (5.375% senior unsecured notes due June 30, 2015) — 1,137Short-term debt 2,591 2,042NYSE USD Notes (2.00% senior unsecured notes due October 5, 2017)852 8532018 Senior Notes (2.50% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2018) 597 5952020 Senior Notes (2.75% senior unsecured notes due December 1, 2020)1,239 —2023 Senior Notes (4.00% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2023) 789 7872025 Senior Notes (3.75% senior unsecured notes due December 1, 2025)1,240 —Long term debt4,717 2,235Total debt$7,308 $4,277Senior NotesOn November 24, 2015, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate senior notes, including $1.25 billion principal amount of 2.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due November 2020, or the 2020 Senior Notes, and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due November 2025, or the 2025 Senior Notes. We used the net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes offering, together with $1.6 billion of borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program, to finance the $4.1 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of Interactive Data.In October 2013, we issued $600 million principal amount of 2.50% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due October 2018, or the 2018 Senior Notes, and $800 million principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due October 2023, or the 2023 Senior Notes. We used the net proceeds from the 2018 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes offering to finance, together with cash on hand and $400 million borrowed in October 2013 under the Revolving Facility, the $2.7 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of NYSE.Credit FacilitiesIn April 2014, ICE, as parent borrower, and our subsidiary ICE Europe Parent Limited, as subsidiary borrower, entered into a $3.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 2014 Credit Facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or Wells Fargo, as administrative agent, issuing lender and swing line lender, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and the lenders party thereto. The 2014 Credit Facility was scheduled to end on April 3, 2019. Of the amounts available under the 2014 Credit Facility, we previously reserved $303 million to provide liquidity or required financial resources for the operations of our clearing houses. This amount included $150 million for ICE Clear Europe, $100 million for ICE Clear Credit, $50 million for ICE Clear U.S., and $3 million for ICE Clear Canada. During the fourth quarter of 2015, after additional contributions to the capital of the respective clearing houses, the respective clearing houses determined their own resources to be sufficient and available such that the supplemental amounts previously reserved under the 2014 Credit Facility were no longer required to provide liquidity or required financial resources for their operations.In November 2015, we agreed with a majority of the lenders under the 2014 Credit Facility to amend certain terms of the 2014 Credit Facility. The amendments include, but are not limited to, extending the maturity date to November 13, 2020 and increasing the ratio level in the maximum total leverage ratio covenant from 3.25:1.00 to 3:75:1.00 beginning with the first fiscal quarter ending after the consummation of the Interactive Data acquisition until the first fiscal quarter ending after the first anniversary of the acquisition. In addition, ICE Europe Parent Limited no longer has the ability to borrow amounts under the 2014 Credit Facility. The 2014 Credit Facility, as amended, as is referred to herein as the “Amended Credit Facility.”The Amended Credit Facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available for borrowing by up to $1.0 billion, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions. On November 13, 2015, we utilized this option to increase the amount of the Amended Credit Facility to $3.4 billion. The commitments under the Amended Credit Facility will automatically reduce to $2.95 billion on April 3, 2019. No amounts were outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility as of December 31, 2015. Amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. The Amended Credit Facility provides for a $3.4 billion multi-currency revolving facility, with sub-limits for non-dollar borrowings and letters of credit and with a swing-line facility available on a same-day basis. Of the $3.4 billion that is available for borrowing under the 60Amended Credit Facility, $2.6 billion is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2015. The amount required to back-stop the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining $809 million as of December 31, 2015 is available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.Borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate or (b) a “base rate” plus an applicable margin rate; provided, however, that all loans denominated in a foreign currency will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate. The “base rate” equals the higher of (i) Wells Fargo’s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.00%. The applicable margin rate is based upon our public long term debt ratings and ranges from 0.875% to 1.50% on LIBOR borrowings and from 0.00% to 0.50% on base rate borrowings.The Amended Credit Facility includes an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount, multiplied by an applicable commitment fee rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. The applicable commitment fee rate ranges from 0.08% to 0.20% and is determined based on our long term debt rating. As of December 31, 2015, the applicable commitment fee rate was 0.125% based on our current long term debt ratings. In November 2011, we entered into senior unsecured credit facilities in the aggregate amount of $2.6 billion, or the 2011 Credit Facilities. The 2011 Credit Facilities consisted of (i) an aggregate $500 million five-year senior unsecured term loan facility, or the Term Loan Facility, and (ii) an aggregate $2.1 billion five-year senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, or the Revolving Facility. In October 2013, we borrowed $900 million under the Revolving Facility, of which $400 million was used to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for our acquisition of NYSE while the remaining $500 million was used to pay off the outstanding commercial paper obligations of NYSE, as well as to fund certain deal related fees and expenses. In December 2013, we repaid the $900 million borrowed under the Revolving Facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and with cash on hand.In connection with us entering into the 2014 Credit Facility in April 2014, the 2011 Credit Facilities were terminated and the $367 million outstanding under the Term Loan Facility was repaid through the issuance of commercial paper. No amounts were outstanding under the Revolving Facility when it was terminated.Commercial Paper ProgramIn December 2013, we entered into a U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program. Our Commercial Paper Program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the Amended Credit Facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (such as USD LIBOR). The fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense.We used net proceeds from notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2015 to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price of Interactive Data and to pay related fees and expenses, to repurchase our common stock, and for general corporate purposes. We used net proceeds from notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2014 to repay the $367 million that was outstanding under the Term Loan Facility upon termination of the Term Loan Facility in April 2014, to fund certain of our acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock. We repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2014 using a combination of the cash proceeds received from the IPO and sale of Euronext, the sale of NYSE Technologies and cash flows from operations. We used the net proceeds from the notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2013, along with cash on hand, to repay the $900 million borrowed under the Revolving Facility and the $450 million borrowed under the 2013 364 Day Facility. 364 Day FacilitiesOn November 13, 2015, we entered into a $500 million 364 day senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 2015 364 Day Facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo, as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and the lenders signatory thereto. The amounts available under the 2015 364 Day Facility are available for use by us for working capital and general corporate purposes but specifically excluding any use to back-stop amounts issued under the Commercial Paper Program. The commitments under the 2015 364 Day Credit Facility will be automatically reduced to $375 million on May 13, 2016 and to $250 million on August 13, 2016. Borrowings under the 2015 364 Day Facility will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding under the same terms as the Amended Credit Facility disclosed above.61The 2015 364 Day Facility includes an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount, multiplied by an applicable commitment fee rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. The applicable commitment fee rate ranges from 0.07% to 0.175% and is determined based on our long term debt rating. As of December 31, 2015, the applicable commitment fee rate was 0.10% based on our current long term debt ratings.In July 2013, we entered into a $600 million 364 day senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 2013 364 Day Facility. The 2013 364 Day Facility was available for working capital and general corporate purposes. In October 2013, we borrowed $450 million under the 2013 364 Day Facility to fund the prepayment of the Private Senior Notes. In December 2013, we repaid the $450 million borrowed under the 2013 364 Day Facility with the proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper. In connection with us entering into the 2014 Credit Facility, the 2013 364 Day Facility was terminated in April 2014, at which time no amounts were outstanding. NYSE NotesIn connection with the acquisition of NYSE, one of our subsidiaries assumed the outstanding NYSE debt instruments, which included $850 million of 2.0% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in October 2017, or the NYSE USD Notes, and €920 million ($1.1 billion) of 5.375% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in June 2015, or the NYSE EUR Notes, and together with the NYSE USD Notes, the NYSE Notes. On June 30, 2015, we repaid the NYSE EUR Notes using cash that had been set aside in July 2014 from the proceeds of the Euronext IPO. The cash, in the amount of €969 million ($1.2 billion) had been placed in term deposits that matured on June 25, 2015. The cash was sufficient to settle the principal maturity of €920 million ($1.1 billion) and the final interest coupon of €49 million ($60 million).Private Senior NotesSimultaneous with entering into the 2011 Credit Facilities in November 2011, we also entered into a note purchase agreement with various institutional investors providing for the sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes, consisting of $200 million of our 4.13% Senior Notes, Tranche A, due November 9, 2018 and $200 million of our 4.69% Senior Notes, Tranche B, due November 9, 2021, or collectively, the Private Senior Notes.In October 2013, following the issuance of the 2018 Senior Notes and the 2023 Senior Notes, we prepaid the $400 million aggregate principal amount of Private Senior Notes. In connection with the early payoff of the Private Senior Notes, we incurred $51 million in expenses relating to a $49 million pre-payment to the Private Senior Notes investors and an associated $2 million write off of the related debt issuance costs. To fund the prepayment of the Private Senior Notes and the associated pre-payment, we borrowed $450 million in October 2013 under the 2013 364 Day Facility. Refer to note 9 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional information on our debt and debt facilities. Future Capital Requirements Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of our trading and clearing volume growth, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business, and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. We currently expect to make aggregate operational capital expenditures and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between $270 million and $280 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology and the continued expansion of our businesses. In addition, we currently expect between $45 million to $55 million in real estate capital expenditures during 2016, on leasehold improvement expenditures primarily associated with our Atlanta headquarters. Our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board of directors or audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we paid cash dividends of $2.90 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including a quarterly dividend for the first quarter of 2015 of $0.65 per share and quarterly dividends for the next three quarters of 2015 of $0.75 per share, for an aggregate payout of $331 million in 2015, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents. For the first quarter of 2016, we announced a $0.85 per share dividend, which is a 13% increase over the prior dividend, which is payable on March 31, 2016 to shareholders of record as of March 16, 2016.As of December 31, 2015, we had $7.3 billion in outstanding debt. We currently have $3.4 billion available for borrowing under our Amended Credit Facility. After factoring in the $2.6 billion currently required to back-stop the Commercial Paper Program, $809 62million of our Amended Credit Facility is currently available for general corporate purposes. On November 13, 2015, we entered into the $500 million 2015 364 Day Facility. The amounts available under the 2015 364 Day Facility are available for use by us for working capital and general corporate purposes but specifically excluding any use to back-stop amounts issued under the Commercial Paper Program.Our $3.4 billion Amended Credit Facility, our $500 million 2015 364 Day Facility and our Commercial Paper Program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources. In the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise the necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. However, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. See “- Debt” above. In connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we assumed NYSE’s pension plans covering its U.S. and certain European operations. The benefit accrual for the U.S. operations pension plan is frozen. Following the Euronext IPO in June 2014, there are no longer any NYSE European operations covered by the pension plans. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we contributed $10 million to our pension plans. Our practice is to fund our frozen defined benefit pension plan each year at a level above the minimum required contribution but within tax deductible limits. Based on actuarial projections, we estimate that a contribution of $10 million in 2016 will allow us to meet our funding goal. However, the actual contribution is contingent on the actual plan performance relative to assumptions.We own ICE Futures Europe and LIFFE Administration and Management, or Liffe, both of which are U.K. Recognized Investment Exchanges. As U.K. Recognized Investment Exchanges, ICE Futures Europe and Liffe are required by the Financial Conduct Authority in the U.K. to satisfy a financial resources recognition requirement which restrict the use of the equivalent of six months of operating expenditures, subject to certain deductions, in cash or cash equivalents or investments at all times. As of December 31, 2015, the regulatory capital for ICE Futures Europe and Liffe was $57 million and $106 million, respectively. Such amounts are reflected as short-term restricted cash and investments in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2015. In November 2014, we completed the transition of Liffe’s contracts to ICE Futures Europe. While Liffe still has a regulated status as of December 31, 2015, we have applied for a de-recognition order, which will result in the release of the $106 million in regulatory capital and an increase in our cash and cash equivalents when approved. We own a 40% interest in OCC through a direct investment by NYSE. OCC adopted a new capital plan during the year ended December 31, 2015, which raised $150 million in equity capital from OCC's shareholders, including $60 million contributed by us. In addition, under the OCC capital plan, the OCC shareholders will contribute up to $200 million in additional equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by us. Refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this Annual Report, for additional information on the OCC capital plan. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We strongly recommend that investors review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.Adjusted total operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ICE common shareholders from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below, which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, and their related income tax effect (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts): 63 Year Ended December 31, Three Months Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 2015 2014 2013Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses$3,338 $3,092 $1,598 $875 $800 $536Total operating expenses1,588 1,644 808 457 400 373Less: NYSE and Interactive Data transaction and integration costs and acquisition related success fees 83 124 140 52 27 109Less: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles140 131 56 41 33 20Less: Duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs— — 7 — — —Adjusted total operating expenses$1,365 $1,389 $605 $364 $340 $244Operating income$1,750 $1,448 $790 $418 $400 $163Adjusted operating income$1,973 $1,703 $993 $511 $460 $292Operating margin52% 47% 49% 48% 50% 30%Adjusted operating margin59% 55% 62% 58% 58% 54% Income (loss) from continuing operations$1,295 $1,005 $320 $373 $294 $(120)Add: NYSE and Interactive Data transaction and integration costs and acquisition related success fees 83 124 140 52 27 109Add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles140 131 56 41 33 20Add: Cetip impairment loss— — 190 — — 190Add: Early payoff of outstanding debt— — 51 — — 51Add: Litigation settlements and accruals, net15 — — — — —Add: Pre-acquisition interest expense on debt issued for Interactive Data acquisition5 — — 5 — —Add: Duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs— — 7 — — —Less: Net gain on the sale of 6% remaining ownership in Euronext— (4) — — (4) —Less: Other income from OCC equity investment— (26) — — (26) —Less: Income tax effect related to the items above(83) (89) (85) (31) (19) (53)Less: Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles(82) (14) — (68) (8) —Add: Other tax adjustments7 12 — — 3 —Less: Net income from continuing operations attributable to non-controlling interest(21) (35) (16) (3) (6) (6)Adjusted net income attributable to ICE common shareholders from continuing operations$1,359 $1,104 $663 $369 $294 $191 Basic earnings per share attributable to ICE common shareholders from continuing operations$11.45 $8.50 $3.88 $3.31 $2.56 $(1.32)Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common shareholders from continuing operations$11.39 $8.46 $3.84 $3.29 $2.54 $(1.31) Adjusted basic earnings per share attributable to ICE common shareholders from continuing operations$12.21 $9.67 $8.45 $3.30 $2.60 $2.02Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common shareholders from continuing operations$12.15 $9.63 $8.38 $3.27 $2.59 $2.00 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding111 114 78 112 112 95Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding112 115 79 112 113 96Acquisition-related transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. However, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to NYSE and Interactive Data are included in non-GAAP adjustments given the sizes of these acquisitions. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-GAAP adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results.During the year and/or three months ended December 31, 2015, we also include as non-GAAP adjustments various litigation settlements and accruals and the interest expense on the senior notes and commercial paper we issued for the Interactive Data acquisition from the issuance date of the new senior notes on November 24, 2015 and on the issuance dates of the commercial paper in early December 2015 to the acquisition date of Interactive Data on December 14, 2015. During the year and three months ended December 31, 2014, we also include as non-GAAP adjustments the net gain on the sale of our 6% remaining ownership in Euronext and the income recognized on our OCC equity investment. During the year and/or three months ended December 31, 2013, we also include as non-GAAP adjustments the impairment loss recorded on our equity investment in Cetip, the expense relating to the early payoff of outstanding debt and the duplicate rent expenses and lease termination costs we incurred as we consolidated multiple New York office locations. For additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “- Operating Expenses” and “- Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” above. The 64income tax effects relating to these items above are included in non-GAAP adjustments, as well as deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles and other tax adjustments relating to certain foreign tax law changes.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table presents, for the periods indicated, our contractual obligations (which we intend to fund from our existing cash as well as cash flow from operations) and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2015 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 YearsContractual Obligations: Short-term and long-term debt and interest $8,319 $2,738 $1,724 $1,477 $2,380Operating lease obligations 394 42 131 65 156Purchase obligations68 63 5 — —Russell licensing agreement (minimum annual payments) 35 20 15 — —Other liabilities and commitments 10 5 5 — —Total contractual cash obligations $8,826 $2,868 $1,880 $1,542 $2,536Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancelable at any time without penalty.We have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above $51.2 billion in cash margin deposits and guaranty fund liabilities. Clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. The cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits and guaranty funds’ liabilities. We have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or UTBs, from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above. As of December 31, 2015, our cumulative UTBs were $107 million. Interest and penalties related to UTBs were $33 million as of December 31, 2015. We are under examination by various tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict, the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. It is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our UTBs. As of December 31, 2015, in connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs. We have a 40% ownership in OCC. Under the OCC's new capital plan, the OCC shareholders have committed to contribute up to $200 million in equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by NYSE. See “- Future Capital Requirements” above.65New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.66Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to the accounting matters described below. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments. Based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. The values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets We have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. As of December 31, 2015, we had goodwill of $12.1 billion and net other intangible assets of $10.8 billion relating to our acquisitions, our purchase of trademarks and Internet domain names from various third parties, and the Russell licensing agreement. Of these amounts, $3.6 billion in goodwill and $3.2 billion of other intangible assets relates to our recent acquisitions of Interactive Data on December 14, 2015 and Trayport on December 11, 2015. We do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. In performing the purchase price allocation, we consider, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. At the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation. We continue to review and validate estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period. Accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. The allocation of the purchase price for Interactive Data and Trayport will be finalized upon the completion of the analysis of the acquired assets and liabilities, including goodwill and other intangible assets, during the year ended December 31, 2016. Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. Subsequent to our acquisition of NYSE, we identified five reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our CDS reporting unit, our cash listings reporting unit, our Euronext reporting unit and our technology reporting unit. The cash listings, Euronext and technology reporting units were added as part of our NYSE acquisition on November 13, 2013. As a result of the IPO of Euronext and the sale of NYSE Technologies during the year ended December 31, 2014, we no longer have a Euronext reporting unit or a technology reporting unit. We completed the acquisitions of Interactive Data and Trayport in December 2015, subsequent to our annual impairment test completed in our fiscal fourth quarter and are in the process of evaluating the impact to our reporting units.67Goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. The initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. However, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. For annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. Otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. For annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount. Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. These estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. Future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets through December 31, 2015. We are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. If an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. Fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis. Our evaluation has not resulted in any impairment of other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment through December 31, 2015.Among our finite-lived intangible assets, we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis to test whether the CDS Creditex customer relationship intangible asset was recoverable as we concluded that indicators of impairment were present in the current year. CDS trade execution revenues at Creditex have decreased over the last several years as trading volumes in the global CDS market have declined and CDS trading remains muted due to financial reform implementation and lower volatility in corporate credit markets. We identified the decline in revenues and the delay in their expected recovery as a triggering event in the current year requiring our Creditex customer relationship intangible asset to be tested for recoverability. As of December 31, 2015, the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset had a remaining net book value of $61 million and will become fully amortized in August 2020. The results of the recoverability test indicated that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the asset by 8%.We continue to monitor potential triggering events in our CDS trade execution business, including changes in the business and regulatory climate in which it operates, the volatility in the capital markets, our recent operating performance and our financial projections. Any changes in these factors could result in further testing for recoverability, and, if it was determined that the carrying value of the asset was not recoverable, an impairment of the asset would then be recorded.Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., U.K. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse. 68We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. The undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been made in our consolidated financial statements. A distribution of these non-U.S. earnings in the form of dividends, or otherwise, could subject us to both U.S. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for non-U.S. tax credits, and withholding taxes payable to the various non-U.S. countries. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable. We operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. ITEM 7 (A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments were $1.6 billion and $2.5 billion, respectively, of which $448 million and $1.5 billion, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or Canadian dollars. Of the $1.5 billion as of December 31, 2014, €969 million ($1.2 billion) represented euro-denominated cash that was placed in term deposits at various banks with a maturity date of June 25, 2015 that were used to repay the NYSE EUR Notes on maturity at June 30, 2015. The decrease in the balances above as of December 31, 2015 was due to the use of the short-term euro-denominated term deposit investments to repay the NYSE EUR Notes upon their maturity. The remaining cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. A hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $2 million as of December 31, 2015, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments. Our investment in Cetip, which is recorded as an available-for-sale, long-term investment and is recorded and held in Brazilian reais, was valued at $299 million as of December 31, 2015, including an accumulated unrealized loss of $25 million. Changes in the fair value of the Cetip investment are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and do not impact earnings, except to the extent that unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary. As of December 31, 2015, we had $7.3 billion in outstanding debt, of which $3.9 billion relates to senior notes and $852 million relates to the NYSE Notes, all of which bear interest at fixed interest rates. The remaining amount outstanding of $2.6 billion relates to the Commercial Paper Program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2015 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $26 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. The interest rates on our Commercial Paper Program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. See Item 7 “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Debt” included elsewhere in this Annual Report. 69Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk As an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. Certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. Our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates): Year Ended December 31, 2015 Pound Sterling EuroAverage exchange rate to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2015$1.5292 $1.1117Average exchange rate to the U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2014$1.6481 $1.3300Average exchange rate decrease in 2015 compared to 2014(7)% (16)%Foreign denominated percentage of: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses11 % 4 %Operating expenses10 % 2 %Operating income11 % 7 %Impact of the currency fluctuations (1) on: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses$(27) $(28)Operating expenses$(12) $(5)Operating income$(15) $(23)(1)Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in the prior year.We have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. For the year ended December 31, 2015, 15% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 12% of our consolidated expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. We have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We had foreign currency transaction losses of $14 million, $2 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively, primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar, which strengthened. A 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2015 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $7 million, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity.Historically we have not entered into forward currency exchange rate contracts, and to the extent that our currency exposures are not hedged, exchange rate movements may cause fluctuations in our consolidated financial statements. Accordingly, if there are adverse movements in exchange rates, our revenues may be lower and we may suffer significant losses, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Although we may enter into hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities. We have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. Our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): As of December 31, 2015 Position in Pounds Sterling Position in EurosAssets£1,205 €331 of which goodwill represents523 43Liabilities255 177Net currency position£950 €154Impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates$141 $1770As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) from foreign currency translation was ($45 million) and $13 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2015, we had net exposure of pounds sterling and euro of £950 million ($1.4 billion) and €154 million ($168 million), respectively. Based on these December 31, 2015 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of pound sterling against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $141 million and a hypothetical 10% decrease of euro against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $17 million. For the year ended December 31, 2015, currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of $58 million on our consolidated equity.Credit Risk We are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. Our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. We seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.Clearing House Cash Deposit RisksOur clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. Refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information about clearing house cash deposits, which were $51.2 billion as of December 31, 2015. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.Credit RiskWe are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we execute agreements and make investments. In addition, when a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits reflecting a number of factors including ratings assigned by rating agencies, CDS spreads and internal ratings, as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. We seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) to avoid a concentration of risk.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. To mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price. Our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments of cash deposits. For example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. In addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, U.S. Treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (Euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities. 71Security Issuer RiskSecurity issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments. Investment Counterparty RiskInvestment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral under the repurchase agreement to high quality issuers. When engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts under clearing house control. Additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. The typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty’s obligation to the clearing house.Our clearing houses may use third party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided to them by the clearing house. Such investment advisors do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments. Clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control. Clearing house property is held with credit worthy custodians including JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., Citibank N.A., BNY Mellon, BMO Harris N.A. and Euroclear Bank Brussels (for non-U.S. dollar deposits). Each clearing house employs (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single investment advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional investment advisors or custodians are available as alternatives. Cross-Currency Margin Deposit RiskEach of our clearing houses, pursuant to their rules, may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in U.S. dollars to secure a Euro margin obligation). The clearing houses mitigate the risk of a decline in currency value by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of high currency volatility. Cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.Impact of Inflation We have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or to decline. In the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.72",2023-12-30 20:40:52.716194
1571949,ICE,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.",2017,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading “Forward Looking Statements” at the beginning of this Annual Report and in Item 1(A) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in Item 6 “Selected Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview We are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity and financial markets. We operate regulated marketplaces for listing, trading and clearing a broad array of derivatives and securities contracts across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, interest rates, equities, equity derivatives, exchange traded funds, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. We offer end-to-end market data services to support the trading, investment, risk management and connectivity needs of customers across virtually all asset classes.Our exchanges include futures exchanges in the U.S., U.K., Continental Europe, Canada and Singapore, and cash equities, equity options and bond exchanges in the U.S. We also operate OTC markets for physical energy and CDS trade execution. To serve global derivatives markets, we operate central counterparty clearing houses in the U.S., U.K., Continental Europe, Canada and Singapore. We offer a range of data services for global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, desktops and connectivity solutions. Through our markets, clearing houses, listings and data services, we provide end-to-end solutions for our customers through liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets, and related services to support their ability to manage risk and raise capital. Our business is currently conducted as two reportable business segments, our Trading and Clearing segment and our Data and Listings segment, and the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S. and U.K.Recent Developments Stock SplitOn November 3, 2016, a 5-for-1 split of our common stock was effected in the form of a four share stock dividend per share of common stock to shareholders of record as of the close of market on October 27, 2016. The new shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on November 4, 2016. All share and earnings per share information has been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split. We retired all of our outstanding treasury shares effective October 27, 2016, the record date. AcquisitionsOn October 3, 2016, we acquired from S&P Global 100% of Standard & Poor’s Securities Evaluations, Inc., or SPSE, and 100% of Credit Market Analysis for $431 million in cash. The cash consideration was funded from borrowings under our commercial paper program. SPSE, which has been renamed Securities Evaluations, is a provider of fixed income evaluated pricing and Credit Market Analysis is a provider of independent data for the OTC markets, including credit derivatives and bonds. Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis are part of the suite of pricing and analytics products and services that comprise ICE Data Services. In order to comply with an Order of the Securities and Exchange Commission, services offered by Securities Evaluations will be managed and operated separately from the existing fixed income evaluated pricing services offered by Interactive Data, as we work through an integration approach. The acquisitions will enable us to offer customers new data and valuation services. Refer to note 3 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on this acquisition and the other acquisitions discussed below.On June 30, 2016, we acquired a majority equity position in MERSCORP Holdings, Inc., owner of Mortgage Electronic Registrations Systems, Inc., or collectively “MERS”. MERS is a privately held, member-based organization that owns and manages the MERS® System and is made up of thousands of lenders, servicers, sub-servicers, investors and government institutions. In addition, we have entered into a software development agreement to rebuild the MERS® System to benefit the U.S. residential mortgage finance market. The MERS® System is a national electronic registry that tracks the changes in servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in U.S.-based mortgage loans. This new infrastructure is expected to shift its operation to an ICE data center in the first half of 2018. 41The terms of the MERS acquisition include a right for us to purchase all of the remaining equity interests of MERS after we satisfy our deliverables under the software development agreement. In addition, the MERS equity holders may exercise a put option to require us to purchase all of the remaining equity interests of MERS. Each of these terms is subject to certain price provisions. Because we do not have the ability to control MERS’ operations, we have recorded the purchase as an equity method investment and our ratable share of net income (loss) in MERS in future periods will be recorded in our consolidated statements of income as equity earnings of our unconsolidated subsidiaries, below operating income in other income (loss). On December 14, 2015, we acquired 100% of Interactive Data in a stock and cash transaction. The total purchase price was $5.6 billion comprised of cash consideration of $4.1 billion and 32.3 million shares of our common stock, on a post-split basis, and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date. The cash consideration is gross of $301 million of cash held by Interactive Data on the date of the acquisition. The cash consideration was funded from $2.5 billion of net proceeds received on November 24, 2015 in connection with the offering of new senior notes and $1.6 billion of borrowing under our commercial paper program. On December 11, 2015, we acquired 100% of Trayport in a stock transaction. Trayport is a software company that licenses its technology to serve exchanges, OTC brokers and traders to facilitate electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the energy markets. The total purchase price was $620 million, comprised of 12.6 million shares of our common stock, on a post-split basis, and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date. The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority, or the CMA, undertook a review of our acquisition of Trayport under the merger control laws of the U.K. During the pendency of the review, we did not integrate Trayport into our existing business operations. On October 17, 2016, the CMA issued its findings and ordered a divestment of Trayport to remedy what the CMA indicated it believed to be a substantial lessening of competition in the supply of trade execution services and trade clearing services to energy traders in the European Economic Area. In November 2016, we filed an appeal to challenge the CMA’s decision. The outcome of the appeal is expected to be determined in 2017. If our appeal is successful, the matter will be sent back to the CMA for additional review. If our appeal is not successful, we will be forced to sell Trayport and there is no certainty of the price we could receive if a sale were required. The timing of a final decision is uncertain at this time. The functional currency of Trayport is the pound sterling, as this is the currency in which Trayport operates. The $620 million in Trayport net assets were recorded on our December 11, 2015 opening balance sheet at a pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.5218 (£407 million). Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate the Trayport net assets into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling will affect the value of the Trayport balance sheet, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. As of the result of the decrease in the pounds sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate to 1.2336 as of December 31, 2016, the portion of our equity attributable to the Trayport net assets in accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $117 million as of December 31, 2016. If we are required to sell Trayport, we would include the accumulated translation adjustment when computing the gain or loss from the sale. Creditex Customer Relationship Intangible Asset ImpairmentIn August 2016, we sold certain of Creditex’s U.S. voice brokerage operations to Tullett Prebon. During the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued Creditex’s U.K. voice brokerage operations. We continue to operate Creditex’s electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property. We continued to monitor potential impairment triggering events in our CDS trade execution business during 2016, including the impacts of divesting the brokerage business, changes in the business and regulatory climate in which the remaining business operates, the volatility in the capital markets, our recent operating performance and our current financial projections. Based on an analysis of these factors, it was determined that the carrying value of the CDS Creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in September 2016 for $33 million. The impairment was recorded as amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining Creditex customer relationship intangible asset is $14 million and will continue to be amortized over the remaining useful life through August 2020. 42Consolidated Financial HighlightsThe following charts and table summarize our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Change 2015 2014 ChangeTotal revenues, less transaction-based expenses $4,499 $3,338 35% $3,338 $3,092 8 %Total operating expenses $2,332 $1,588 47% $1,588 $1,644 (3)%Adjusted operating expenses(1)$1,947 $1,365 43% $1,365 $1,389 (2)%Operating income $2,167 $1,750 24% $1,750 $1,448 21 %Adjusted operating income(1)$2,552 $1,973 29% $1,973 $1,703 16 %Operating margin 48 % 52 % (4 pts) 52 % 47 % 5 ptsAdjusted operating margin(1)57 % 59 % (2 pts) 59 % 55 % 4 ptsOther expense, net $138 $97 42% $97 $41 134 %Income tax expense $580 $358 62% $358 $402 (11)%Effective tax rate 29% 22% 7 pts 22% 29% (7 pts)Net income from continuing operations$1,449 $1,295 12% $1,295 $1,005 29 %Adjusted net income from continuing operations attributable to ICE(1)$1,665 $1,359 23% $1,359 1,104 23 %Net income attributable to ICE$1,422 $1,274 12% $1,274 $981 30 %Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common shareholders from continuing operations$2.37 $2.28 4% $2.28 $1.69 35 %Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common shareholders from continuing operations(1)$2.78 $2.43 14% $2.43 $1.92 27 %Cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations$2,149 $1,311 64% $1,311 $1,463 (10)%(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts and table above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, net of taxes, as applicable. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. •Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to our acquisitions of Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit 43Market Analysis, and to a lesser extent, revenue increases in our exchange-related data services and Brent crude and agricultural transaction and clearing. We recognized $1.1 billion in Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis data services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $50 million in Interactive Data and Trayport data services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions in December 2015. Partially offsetting the revenue increases were unfavorable foreign exchange effects of $59 million arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar (primarily impacting revenues billed in pounds sterling), for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015. •Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $246 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to increases in our data services revenues, listings revenues and Brent crude transaction and clearing revenues. The data services fee revenues increase was partially due to $50 million in data services revenues from Interactive Data and Trayport during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. These revenue increases were partially offset by decreases in certain interest rate transaction and clearing revenues compared to the prior year period. Also partially offsetting the revenue increases were unfavorable foreign exchange effects of $55 million arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar (primarily impacting revenues billed in pounds sterling and euros), for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the comparable period in 2014. •Total operating expenses increased $744 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to increased operating expenses relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and $33 million relating to the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment recorded in September 2016. Excluding acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, we recognized $812 million in Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $39 million in Interactive Data and Trayport operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions in December 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Also partially offsetting the operating expense increases were favorable foreign exchange effects of $40 million arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar (primarily impacting operating expenses incurred in pounds sterling) for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015.•Total operating expenses decreased $56 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to decreases in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, professional services expenses, rent and occupancy expenses, and selling, general and administrative expenses. Operating expenses also decreased due to the impact of a strengthening U.S. dollar on our foreign currency exchange rates (primarily for those operating expenses incurred in pounds sterling and euros), which reduced our operating expenses by $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. These decreases were partially offset by increases in depreciation expenses compared to the prior year period primarily due to fixed asset additions relating to the NYSE integration and real estate expenditures relating primarily to the Atlanta and New York headquarters. We also had increases in operating expenses during the year ended December 31, 2015 of $39 million from Interactive Data and Trayport (excluding acquisition-related transaction and integration costs), subsequent to their acquisitions. •The lower effective tax rate and income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 are primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future U.K. income tax rate reductions along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities. Business Environment and Market TrendsOur business environment has been characterized by industry consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants’ rising demand for speed, data capacity and connectivity, which requires ongoing investment in technology; evolving and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions; and increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies. Price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk through trading and clearing. Market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market’s strength. In addition, the ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs, develop new products and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing, exclusivity and consolidation is important to our business. Changes in these and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results. For additional information regarding the factors that affect our results of operations, see Item 1(A) “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.The implementation of new laws or regulations or the uncertainty around potential changes may impact participation in our markets, or the demand for our clearing and data services either favorably or unfavorably. Many of the recent changes with regard to 44global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been propagated are being reconsidered. In Europe, final regulations related to Mifid II have not yet been implemented and significant uncertainties and ambiguities remain around such regulations. As this is established, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” included elsewhere in this Annual Report, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.In recent years, low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow or yet to occur global economic recovery. Lower growth in Asia and the European Union may also continue to affect global financial markets. In addition, economic and regulatory uncertainty, coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events, low interest rates and low oil and natural gas prices has affected our clients’ activities in recent years. The duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business across trading and listings. We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 13% in 2012 to 57% in 2016. This non-transaction revenue includes data services, listings and other revenues. We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing and markets.In recent years, financial institutions and corporations have acted to control spending, including on financial information and related services. Yet many of the data products and services we sell are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. While we expect that cost containment pressures will continue, we anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: increasing global regulatory demands; greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; greater emphasis on risk management; market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; the move to passive investing and indexation; ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; increased electronification of fixed income and other less automated markets; the development of new data products; the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; new entrants; and increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions. We contract with clients through data fixed-fee subscriptions, variable fees based on usage or a combination of fixed-fee subscription and usage-based fees. In addition, some of our data services generate one-time or non-recurring revenue, such as one-time purchases of historical data, set-up services or implementation fees.Segment Reporting We operated as a single reportable business segment as of December 31, 2015 but began operating as two operating segments in the first quarter of 2016 following our acquisition of Interactive Data. As of December 31, 2016, we continue to operate as two business segments: our Trading and Clearing segment and our Data and Listings segment. This presentation is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates our business. Our Trading and Clearing segment comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses. Our Data and Listings segment comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses. Our chief operating decision maker does not review total assets, intersegment revenues/expenses or statements of income below operating income by segments; therefore, such information is not presented below. While revenues are allocated directly to segments, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments. Because these expenses do not relate to a single segment, we have employed a reasonable allocation method to allocate expenses between the segments for presentation purposes. We have elected to use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment. Further, precise allocation of expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments is not reasonably possible. Accordingly, we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within the segments.45Trading and Clearing SegmentThe following charts and table present our selected statements of income data for our Trading and Clearing segment, from continuing operations (dollars in millions):(1) The adjusted numbers in the chart above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, net of taxes, as applicable. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

In our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared, and in our equity and equity options markets, we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution. Rates per-contract are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and, though not to the same degree, due to product mix. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 19%, 20% and 26%, respectively, of our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the U.S. dollar, our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, decreased $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015, and decreased $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the comparable period in 2014. See Item 3 “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.Our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $674 million, $563 million and $466 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase 47in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs. Commodities MarketsWe operate global crude oil and refined oil futures markets, including the ICE Brent, ICE WTI and ICE Gasoil futures and options contracts, as well as over 400 refined oil futures products that relate to our benchmark futures contracts. The ICE Brent crude futures contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants, including oil producing nations and multinational companies, to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption. ICE Gasoil is a key refined oil benchmark in Europe and Asia. Total oil volume and revenues increased 12% and 10%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased 17% and 14%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. In 2016, ICE Brent crude futures and options contracts produced the twentieth consecutive year of record volume. ICE Brent crude futures and options volume increased 15% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased 14% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. ICE WTI crude futures and options volume increased 16% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased 26% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. ICE Brent crude and ICE WTI crude futures and options volume increased primarily due to increased oil price volatility; broader market volatility in oil products, equities and foreign exchange rates; acts of central governments; outcomes of elections; and uncertainty around OPEC policy. Our global natural gas futures and options volume declined 2% and revenues increased 4% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, respectively, and volume declined 4% and revenues increased 3% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, respectively. Global natural gas volume declined the last two years due to lower price volatility related to high natural gas supplies but revenues increased due to geographic product mix. Total volume and revenues in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets increased 11% and 8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased 13% and 11%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. Volume in our largest agricultural contract, sugar futures and options, remained flat for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased 18% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. Volume in our other agricultural and metal futures and options volume increased 21% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015 and increased 9% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. The increases in agricultural volume were primarily driven by increased price volatility due to changing supply and demand expectations largely related to weather and production levels. Financial MarketsFinancial futures and options volume increased 10% and revenues decreased 6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and decreased 9% and 14%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. Interest rate futures and options volume increased 12% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and decreased 11% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. Interest rate futures and options volume increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to uncertainty around central bank actions, economic data during 2016, and the U.K.'s decision to exit the European Union. Revenues decreased while volume increased for the interest rates futures and options for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and increased market making rebates that apply at higher volume levels.Other financial futures and options volume increased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and decreased 4% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. Other financial futures and options volume increased for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily due to changes in price volatility in equity indexes driven by equity market volatility. Volume in our MSCI futures and options contracts increased 49% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, due to global equity market volatility.Cash equities handled volume increased 6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to increased market volatility during the first half of 2016. Cash equities handled volume increased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to increased market volatility throughout 2015. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $223 million, $220 million and $188 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Equity options volume decreased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to the same period in 2015, and decreased 20% for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. Equity options revenues, net of 48transaction-based expenses, were $98 million, $112 million and $145 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Equity options volume and revenues decreased the last several years primarily due to the restructuring of the NYSE Amex Options business. While revenues declined the last several years, the overall financial contribution of equity options was consistent with the prior years due to the retention of a higher percentage of profits from NYSE Amex Options driven by our repurchase of the equity in the exchange from the minority shareholders.CDS clearing revenues were $107 million, $100 million and $97 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The notional value of CDS cleared during the same periods were $11.5 trillion, $11.9 trillion and $13.7 trillion, respectively. Buyside participation at our U.S. CDS clearing house, ICE Clear Credit, reached record levels in terms of number of participants and notional cleared due to increased participation from both U.S. and European buyside customers due to greater regulatory certainty, the breadth of products offered, and cost efficient margining in the U.S. relative to Europe. CDS trade execution revenues were $36 million, $49 million and $64 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The notional value of the underlying CDS traded was $417.2 billion, $867.7 billion and $1.0 trillion for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. CDS trading remains muted due to financial reform implementation and lower volatility in corporate credit markets. The decrease in the CDS trade execution revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 is also impacted by the sale and discontinuance of our U.S. and U.K. CDS voice brokerage operations in the third quarter of 2016. Other RevenuesOther revenues include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. The increase in other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to increases in the interest income recognized on certain clearing margin deposits and fees earned on non-cash collateral placed by clearing members primarily due to fee changes and increased clearing margin deposits.49Selected Operating DataThe following charts and table present trading activity and open interest in our futures and options markets by commodity type based on the total number of contracts traded, as well as futures and options rate per contract (in millions, except for percentages and rate per contract amounts): Volume and Rate per Contract Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Change 2015 2014 ChangeNumber of contracts traded: Brent crude futures and options 227 197 15 % 197 174 14 %Other oil futures and options96 86 12 86 69 24Gasoil futures and options 66 64 5 64 53 19Natural gas futures and options 221 226 (2) 226 235 (4)Power futures and options28 29 (3) 29 28 2Emissions and other energy futures and options 10 9 11 9 10 (11)Sugar futures and options43 43 — 43 36 18Other agricultural and metals futures and options57 47 21 47 44 9Interest rates futures and options412 370 12 370 415 (11)Other financial futures and options151 144 5 144 150 (4)Total 1,311 1,215 8 % 1,215 1,214 — % Rate per contract: Energy futures and options rate per contract$1.33 $1.32 1 % $1.32 $1.32 — %Agricultural and metals futures and options rate per contract$2.27 $2.34 (3)% $2.34 $2.38 (2)%Interest rates and other financial futures and options rate per contract$0.54 $0.63 (14)% $0.63 $0.67 (6)%Open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open — in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange. The following table presents our year-end open interest for our futures and options contracts (in thousands, except for percentages). 50Open Interest As of December 31, As of December 31, 2016 2015 Change 2015 2014 ChangeOpen interest — in thousands of contracts: Brent crude futures and options 3,723 3,642 2 % 3,642 3,804 (4)%Other oil futures and options5,105 4,930 4 4,930 4,763 4Gasoil futures and options 854 750 14 750 526 43Natural gas futures and options 17,334 17,769 (2) 17,769 20,517 (13)Power futures and options 7,204 7,524 (4) 7,524 7,167 5Emissions and other energy futures and options 1,549 1,718 (10) 1,718 1,660 4Sugar futures and options1,649 1,769 (7) 1,769 1,479 20Other agricultural and metals futures and options2,271 2,108 8 2,108 1,828 15Interest rates futures and options13,943 19,143 (27) 19,143 13,042 47Other financial futures and options5,470 4,691 17 4,691 4,925 (5)Total 59,102 64,044 (8)% 64,044 59,711 7 % The following charts and table present selected cash and equity options trading data.

Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges. Transaction-Based Expenses Our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees collected from customers are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are designed to recover the government’s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. We, in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing revenues in our consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees which are included in transaction-based expenses in our consolidated statements of income. As a result, activity assessment fees and Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income. Activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of 52receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. As of December 31, 2016, the accrued liability related to the un-remitted SEC Section 31 fees was $131 million.We also incur liquidity payments made to cash and options trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges that are included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginTrading and Clearing segment operating expenses decreased $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015 (with the decrease being partially offset by the $33 million Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense recorded in September 2016), and decreased $96 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. See “- Consolidated Operating Expenses” below. Trading and Clearing segment operating income increased $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased $124 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. Trading and Clearing segment operating margins were 58%, 56% and 50% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The operating income and operating margin increases the last two years were driven by the revenue increases and operating expense decreases discussed above.Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating expenses were $770 million, $809 million and $868 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion for the years for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating margins were 63%, 61% and 57% for the years for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Through ICE Data Services, we generate revenues from a range of data services, including the dissemination of our exchange and evaluated pricing data and analytics, desktops and connectivity and exchange market data. Through NYSE, NYSE MKT and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.Our pricing and analytics services consist of an extensive set of independent evaluated pricing services focused primarily on fixed income and international equity securities, valuation services, reference data, market data, end of day pricing, fixed income, equity portfolio analytics and risk management analytics. We also serve as an administrator of regulated benchmarks, including LIBOR, the ICE Swap Rate and the LBMA Gold Price. Our index services offer a range of products across fixed income, energy, equities, ETFs and other asset classes to provide the methodology, pricing and licensing of key benchmarks.Our desktop and connectivity services comprise technology-based information platforms, feeds and connectivity. These include trading applications, desktop solutions and data feeds to support trading, voice brokers and investment functions. Our desktop and web-based applications deliver real-time market information, analytical and decision support tools to support trading and investment decisions. Through our consolidated feeds, clients receive consolidated real-time and/or delayed financial data from global exchanges, trading venues and data sources for exchange-traded and OTC markets. Our connectivity services offer a secure, resilient, private multi-participant network that provides connectivity to global exchanges and content service providers. Our connectivity infrastructure managed services solution also offers colocation space, direct exchange access, proximity hosting and support services that enable access to real-time exchange data and facilitates low latency electronic trading. Our exchange data primarily represents subscription fees for the provision of our market data that is created from activity in our Trading and Clearing segment. In our derivatives markets, exchange data fees primarily relate to subscription fees charged for customer and license access from third party data vendors, or quote vendors such as Thomson Reuters and Bloomberg, and from end users, as well as view-only data access, direct access services, terminal access, daily indices, forward curves and other valuation services, and end of day reports. We earn exchange data fees relating to our cash equity and options markets, and related data and network services. We collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data products. Consortium-based data fees are determined by the securities industry plans and are charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. Consortium-based data revenues (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating securities markets on the basis of a formula set by the SEC under Regulation NMS. Last trade prices and quotes in New York Stock Exchange-listed, NYSE MKT-listed, and NYSE Arca-listed securities are disseminated through “Tape A” and “Tape B,” which constitute the majority of our revenues from consortium-based market data revenues.Our data services revenues increased during the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the acquisitions of Interactive Data and Trayport in December 2015, the acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis in October 2016, the high retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased usage by existing customers and the development of new and enhanced products designed to efficiently deliver more value to our customers. These increases were partially offset due to the impact of foreign currency translation. We recognized $1.1 billion in 55data services revenues for Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $50 million in data services revenues for Interactive Data and Trayport during year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions dates. Our data services revenues increased during the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to the addition of new users, increased usage by customers, expanded product offerings, fee increases and the addition of SuperDerivatives and ICE Benchmark Administration for all of 2015 and Interactive Data and Trayport subsequent to their acquisitions in December 2015. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 12%, 4% and 4%, respectively, of our Data and Listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros (all relating to our data services revenues). As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the U.S. dollar, our data services revenues decreased $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015, and decreased $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the comparable period in 2014. See Item 3 “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.Listings RevenuesWe recognize listings revenues in our securities markets from two types of fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges - original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to other corporate-related actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. Initial listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of nine years for NYSE and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE MKT. U.S. companies pay annual fees based on the number of outstanding shares the company has and non-U.S. companies pay annual fees based on the number of outstanding shares the company has issued or held in the U.S. Annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year. In addition, other corporate actions-related listing fees are paid by listed companies in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Other corporate actions-related listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of six years for NYSE and three years for NYSE Arca and NYSE MKT. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet. Listings revenues increased for the last two years primarily due to the amortization of the original listing fees earned since the acquisition of NYSE and due to additional annual listing fee revenue from new customers. The listings unamortized deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2016 of $149 million relates to original and other corporate action listing fees incurred and billed and not yet recognized as revenue subsequent to the November 13, 2013 acquisition through December 31, 2016. Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginData and Listings segment operating expenses increased $779 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. The increases primarily relate to the $812 million in operating expenses recognized relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $39 million in operating expenses recognized relating to Interactive Data and Trayport for the year ended December 31, 2015 (both excluding acquisition-related transaction and integration costs). See “- Consolidated Operating Expenses” below for further details on the Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis operating expenses. Data and Listings segment operating income increased $342 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, and increased $178 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. Data and Listings segment operating margins were 39%, 47% and 40% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The operating income increases the last two years were driven by the acquisitions discussed above.Data and Listings segment adjusted operating expenses were $1.2 billion, $556 million and $521 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Data and Listings adjusted operating income was $1.2 billion, $720 million and $537 million for the years for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Data and Listings adjusted operating margins were 51%, 56% and 51% for the years for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.56Consolidated Operating Expenses The majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our financial performance, as discussed below. The following chart and table present our operating expenses from continuing operations (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Change 2015 2014 ChangeCompensation and benefits $945 $611 55 % $611 $592 3 %Professional services 137 139 (1) 139 181 (23)Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs 80 88 (9) 88 129 (32)Technology and communication 374 203 84 203 188 8Rent and occupancy 70 57 21 57 78 (27)Selling, general and administrative 116 116 — 116 143 (19)Depreciation and amortization 610 374 63 374 333 12Total operating expenses $2,332 $1,588 47 % $1,588 $1,644 (3)%57We expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business, and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions and other investments.For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 18%, 12% and 18%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the U.S. dollar, our consolidated operating expenses decreased $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015, and decreased $17 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from the comparable period in 2014. See Item 3 “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.Compensation and Benefits Expenses Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees. Compensation and benefits expenses increased for the last two years primarily due to increases in employee headcount. Our employee headcount increased primarily due to the acquisitions of Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations, Credit Market Analysis, SuperDerivatives, Singapore Mercantile Exchange and Holland Clearing House, converting contractor roles to employees at NYSE, and hiring for clearing, technology, regulation and compliance. Headcount increased from 2,879 employees at December 31, 2013 (excluding the Euronext and NYSE Technologies employees) to 2,902 employees as of December 31, 2014, increased to 5,549 employees as of December 31, 2015, and increased to 5,631 employees as of December 31, 2016. We recognized $342 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to the Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $17 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to Interactive Data and Trayport during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. The employee increases associated with these acquisitions were partially offset by employee terminations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 for NYSE and for the year ended December 31, 2016 for Interactive Data, in connection with our integrations.We recorded $33 million, $20 million and $99 million in NYSE and Interactive Data employee severance costs during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, with such costs included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below and primarily related to executive departures. In addition, we incurred non-acquisition related employee severance costs of $10 million, $3 million and $4 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $123 million, $111 million and $82 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The increases in non-cash compensation expenses primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving non-cash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above. Professional Services Expenses This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings. We recognized $34 million in professional services expenses relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $2 million in professional services expenses for Interactive Data and Trayport during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, professional services expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the continued reduction in professional services and contractors at NYSE. We eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with full time employees at NYSE. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a credit from a third party service provider related to fees charged during 2015, and we incurred lower legal fees during the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Legal fees, which are included in professional services expenses, primarily related to class action lawsuits in which NYSE is a defendant. Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration CostsWe incurred $80 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily relating to our integration of Interactive Data and NYSE, legal and professional fees related to the Trayport CMA review, our investment in MERS, our acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis, and various other potential and discontinued acquisitions. Of this amount, $41 million was primarily related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, 58accountants, tax advisors and other external costs directly related to the completed 2016 acquisitions and to other transactions. We incurred $39 million for Interactive Data and NYSE integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. As of December 31, 2016, the integration of NYSE has been completed and we will no longer include any NYSE integration costs in the future. We incurred $88 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily relating to our acquisitions of Interactive Data and Trayport and the integration of NYSE. Of this amount, $46 million was primarily related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and other external costs directly related to the Interactive Data and Trayport acquisitions and to other transactions. We incurred $42 million for NYSE integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.We incurred $129 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily relating to our acquisition and integration of NYSE and the acquisitions of ICE Futures Singapore, SuperDerivatives, ICE Clear Netherlands and True Office. Of this amount, $6 million was related to fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors and public relations firms, and other external costs directly related to the transactions. The remaining $123 million was for NYSE integration costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily relating to employee termination costs, costs incurred relating to the Euronext IPO and sale, costs incurred relating to the sale of NYSE Technologies, and professional service costs. We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.Technology and Communication Expenses Technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.We recognized $162 million in technology and communication expenses relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $8 million in technology and communication expenses for Interactive Data and Trayport during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. In addition, during the last two years, we incurred increased hardware and software support costs related to our trading and clearing platforms and our data services.Rent and Occupancy ExpensesThis expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in and around Atlanta, New York, London and Boston with smaller offices located throughout the world. See “Item 2 - Properties” above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property. We recognized $28 million in rent and occupancy expenses relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1 million in rent and occupancy expenses for Interactive Data and Trayport during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, rent and occupancy expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to reduced rent and occupancy costs realized due to the continued consolidation of our New York, Atlanta and London office locations.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses This expense relates to expenses from marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs. We recognized $22 million in selling, general and administrative expenses relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $1 million in selling, general and administrative expenses for Interactive Data and Trayport during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the release of non-income tax-related reserves and lower marketing expenses. 59Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally developed and purchased software over their estimated useful lives. We recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on the other intangible assets, of $356 million, $160 million and $151 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recognized $182 million and $8 million in amortization expenses on the Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis intangible assets during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recorded an impairment of the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset of $33 million during the year ended December 31, 2016, which was recorded as amortization expense. See “- Recent Developments - Creditex Customer Relationship Intangible Asset Impairment” above. The increases in amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 discussed above were partially offset by a reduction in amortization expenses recorded on intangible assets which became fully amortized during 2016, primarily related to certain of the NYSE intangible assets.We recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $254 million, $213 million and $182 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We recognized $42 million and $2 million in depreciation expenses on the Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. In addition to the impact of the acquisitions, depreciation expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily due to additional fixed asset additions and capitalized internally developed software, including additions relating to the NYSE integration and real estate expenditures during the last several years relating primarily to the Atlanta, New York and London headquarters. Non-Operating Income (Expenses) Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Change 2015 2014 ChangeOther income (expense): Interest expense $(178) $(97) 83% $(97) $(96) 1 %Other income, net 40 — n/a — 55 n/aTotal other expense, net $(138) $(97) 42% $(97) $(41) 134 % Net income attributable to non-controlling interest $(27) $(21) 28% $(21) $(35) (39)%Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the interest expense we recognized on the additional debt incurred to finance the Interactive Data acquisition in December 2015. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to new debt we incurred for the Interactive Data acquisition during the fourth quarter of 2015, partially offset by the repayment of $1.0 billion in NYSE EUR Notes on June 30, 2015. See “- Debt” below. We account for our investment in Cetip as an available-for-sale investment and it is classified as a long-term investment in our consolidated balance sheet. We recognized dividend income primarily received relating to our Cetip investment in other income, which was $19 million, $16 million and $23 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We account for our investments in MERS and The Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, as equity method investments. We recognized $25 million, $6 million and $25 million in equity income related to these investments during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, as other income. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $15 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters (net of insurance proceeds), which was recorded in other expense. We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $1 million, $14 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense) and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. See Item 7A 60“- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information on these items.For consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as non-controlling interests. During the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we repurchased the remaining ownership of NYSE Amex Options from the minority owners. Effective from July 1, 2015, all of the profits from NYSE Amex Options are retained by us as we now own 100% of NYSE Amex Options. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this Annual Report, for additional information on NYSE Amex Options. The decrease in the net income attributable to non-controlling interest for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to a decrease in the net income relating to the NYSE Amex Options minority ownership interest primarily due to the reduction in the minority ownership percentage. Income Tax Provision Consolidated income tax expense from continuing operations was $580 million, $358 million and $402 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate each year. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations was 29%, 22% and 29% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable foreign income tax rate differentials and favorable tax law changes, partially offset by state income taxes. Favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower tax rates in the U.K and various other lower tax jurisdictions as compared to the tax rates in the U.S. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the U.K. reduced the corporate income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective April 1, 2017 and to 18% effective April 1, 2020. During the third quarter of 2016, the U.K. further reduced their corporate income tax rate from 18% to 17% effective April 1, 2020. The reduction in the future U.K. corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits. The impact of the deferred tax benefit for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 lower the effective tax rate by 2% and 4%, respectively. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to the tax impact of foreign versus U.S. based pre-tax income, lower deferred tax benefit associated with the future U.K. income tax rate reduction, and greater favorable settlements with various taxing authorities in 2015, partially offset by a tax benefit from the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2016. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future U.K. income tax rate reductions along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this Annual Report, for additional information on these tax items.Discontinued OperationsOn November 13, 2013, we acquired 100% of NYSE for $11.1 billion, comprised of cash consideration of $2.7 billion and 211.9 million shares of our common stock, on a post-split basis, and their results are included in our consolidated results effective from the acquisition date. NYSE owned and operated Euronext, which was comprised of continental European-based exchanges. On June 24, 2014, we sold an aggregate 65.8 million shares of common stock of Euronext, representing 94% of all outstanding shares, in three transactions. The three transactions include our sale of 42.2 million shares of Euronext common stock in an initial public offering, or IPO, at €20 per share, 23.4 million shares of Euronext common stock to a group of European institutional investors at €19.20 per share, and 0.2 million shares of Euronext common stock to eligible Euronext employees at €16 per share. On December 9, 2014, we sold our remaining 4.2 million shares of Euronext common stock, representing 6% of the outstanding shares of Euronext, for €95 million ($118 million). We no longer hold any shares of Euronext stock and these four transactions generated an aggregate €1.5 billion ($2.1 billion) of net cash proceeds for us. The net cash proceeds received included cash of $220 million distributed from Euronext as part of the separation of Euronext from us. NYSE previously operated a commercial technology business, NYSE Technologies, which offered transaction, data and infrastructure services, and managed solutions for market participants. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we sold NYFIX, Metabit and Wombat, the three companies that comprised NYSE Technologies. These sales completed our previously announced intention to divest non-core NYSE Technologies assets. The results of Euronext, NYFIX, Metabit and Wombat are reflected as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements. We used the net cash proceeds from the IPO and sales to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. See “- Debt” below. Also, refer to note 16 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the IPO and sales and the presentation of the results as discontinued operations. There was no gain or loss recognized on the Euronext IPO or on the sale of the NYSE Technologies companies, as any differences in the carrying value of these net assets was adjusted in the NYSE purchase price allocation. The results below include 61external advisory costs and professional services costs related to the sales of Euronext and NYSE Technologies of $51 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which have been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations. The results below also include deal-related compensation and severance costs related to the sales of Euronext and NYSE Technologies of $42 million for the year ended December 31, 2014, which have also been included with acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, below, from discontinued operations.

See “- Recent Developments - Creditex Customer Relationship Intangible Asset Impairment” above.(3) The decrease in the income tax expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and for the three months ended December 31, 2015 is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future U.K. income tax rate reductions. See “- Consolidated Income Tax Provision” above.63Liquidity and Capital Resources Below are charts that reflect our capital allocation. The acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes both the net cash paid for the acquisitions and the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in each year.We have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends to our shareholders and the continued development of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures. In the future, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities, which we may be unable to do or to do on favorable terms. We used the cash proceeds from the Euronext IPO and sale to repay debt and we used the net cash proceeds from the sale of select NYSE Technology businesses to repay debt, invest in growth initiatives, pursue strategic investments and return capital to shareholders via dividends and share repurchases. See “- Discontinued Operations” above and “- Debt” and “- Future Capital Requirements” below.On October 3, 2016, we acquired Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis for $431 million in cash. The cash consideration was funded from borrowing under our commercial paper program. On December 14, 2015, we acquired Interactive Data in a stock and cash transaction. The total purchase price was $5.6 billion, comprised of cash consideration of $4.1 billion and 32.3 million shares of our common stock (the cash consideration is gross of $301 million of cash held by Interactive Data on the date of the acquisition). The cash consideration was funded from $2.5 billion of net proceeds received on November 24, 2015 in connection with the offering of new senior notes and $1.6 billion of borrowing under our commercial paper program. On December 11, 2015, we acquired Trayport in a stock transaction. The total purchase price was $620 million, comprised of 12.6 million shares of our common stock. Our commercial paper program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. We reduced our outstanding commercial paper during the year ended December 31, 2016 by $949 million, enabled by strong cash flows and a reduction in our unrestricted cash balance, partially offset by $431 million in commercial paper borrowing in October 2016 to fund the purchase price of the Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions. Upon maturity of old issuances of commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. To mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain an undrawn back-stop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our commercial paper 64program. If we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the back-stop revolving facility, however electing to do so would result in higher interest expense. See “- Debt” below.Consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $407 million and $627 million as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We had $432 million and $299 million in long-term investments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and $943 million and $920 million in short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments as of December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We consider all short-term, highly liquid investments with remaining maturity dates of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. We classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. Cash and investments that are not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and investments. As of December 31, 2016, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was $250 million. While we consider our non-U.S. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the U.S., any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both U.S. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for any non-U.S. tax credits. However, we do not have any current needs or foreseeable future needs or other plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. Our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. We may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.Certain of these investments, with an original maturity of greater than three months, will be classified as available-for-sale in accordance with relevant accounting standards. Available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. We do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we repurchased 902,920 shares, 14,343,845 shares and 16,157,420 shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $50 million, $660 million and $645 million, respectively. These repurchases were completed under stock repurchase plans authorized by our board of directors. In connection with our acquisition of Interactive Data during the fourth quarter of 2015, we suspended our stock repurchase plan and that plan expired shortly thereafter. The timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. Our management and board of directors periodically review whether or not to be active in repurchasing our stock. In making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, we consider multiple factors. The factors may include: overall stock market conditions, our common stock price movements, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board of directors, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources. In August 2016, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date, subject to applicable laws and regulations. Repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market, through established plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. We have entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, as authorized by our board of directors, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock, and we began to repurchase shares in October 2016. We may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time. The approval of our board of directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. In addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time and our purchases will generally depend upon market conditions, our stock price, our target debt ratio and corporate debt rating, and our strategic growth initiatives at that time. We expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our debt facilities or commercial paper program. The shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining board authorization permits repurchases of up to $950 million of our common stock with no fixed expiration date. Cash Flow The following presents the major components of net increases (decreases) in cash and cash equivalents (in millions):65 Year Ended December 31,2016 2015 2014Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities from continuing operations$2,149 $1,311 $1,463Investing activities from continuing operations(898) (3,298) 36Financing activities from continuing operations(1,462) 1,976 (1,673)Discontinued operations— — (114)Effect of exchange rate changes (9) (14) (21)Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $(220) $(25) $(309)Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital. Fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations is primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and due to fluctuations in working capital. The $838 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to $393 million in cash provided by operating activities for Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2016, increase in the net income of our historical income statement excluding the acquisitions, and other fluctuations in working capital (including the impact of the increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2015 as discussed below). The $152 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014, is primarily due to normal changes in operating cash flow during the year and timing of repayment of accrued expenses, including an increase of $204 million in cash paid for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2015, from the comparable period in 2014. Investing Activities Consolidated net cash (used in) provided by investing activities from continuing operations for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 primarily relates to cash paid for acquisitions, cash proceeds from the IPO and sale of Euronext and NYSE Technologies, purchases/proceeds from term deposits and sales of available-for-sale investments, changes in the restricted cash and investment balances, and increases in the capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. We paid cash for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $425 million, $3.8 billion and $577 million, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, primarily relating to the Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016, the Interactive Data acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2015, and the SuperDerivatives, ICE Futures Singapore, ICE Clear Netherlands and True Office acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2014. We received net cash proceeds from the IPO and sale of Euronext shares and the sale of NYSE Technologies of $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2014. We purchased euro-denominated term deposits of $1.3 billion during the year ended December 31, 2014 and we received proceeds from the euro-denominated terms deposits of $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015 relating to the repayments of the NYSE EUR Notes. See “- Debt” below for a discussion of the term deposits. The decrease in the value of the euro-denominated term notes is due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the euro during 2015. We had net increases in restricted cash and investments of $38 million, $294 million and $161 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The restricted cash increase in 2016 primarily related to increases in the regulatory capital restricted cash at ICE Clear Europe, ICE Futures Europe, ICE Clear U.S. and ICE Clear Credit. The increases in the regulatory capital restricted cash at ICE Clear U.S and ICE Clear Credit were primarily due our voluntarily adoption of the application of EMIR capital requirements for our U.S. clearing houses, which exceeded the CFTC financial resource requirements as of December 31, 2016. The increases in the regulatory capital restricted cash at ICE Clear Europe and ICE Futures Europe were primarily due to additional expenses incurred due to the growth of our trading and clearing businesses and additional regulatory capital buffers required by the Bank of England that we have classified as restricted cash. These 2016 increases were partially offset by the elimination of the regulatory capital restricted cash at LIFFE Administration and Management and a decrease in the restricted cash held as escrow for the SuperDerivatives acquisition. The restricted cash increase in 2015 primarily related to additional cash that was put into our clearing houses to cover our financial resources, regulatory capital needs and for liquidity purposes. The restricted cash increase in 2014 primarily related to a contribution to the ICE Clear U.S. guaranty fund in connection with ICE Clear U.S.’s status as a QCCP, cash escrow set aside for the SuperDerivatives acquisition, regulatory capital from HCH after our acquisition, and increases in the regulatory capital of ICE Clear 66Europe and ICE Futures Europe due to additional expenses incurred at both of these companies due to growth of these businesses. Refer to note 4 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the changes in our restricted cash and investments. Capital expenditures were $250 million, $190 million and $172 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $115 million, $87 million and $78 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements associated with the new and renovated office spaces in Atlanta, New York and London. The software development expenditures primarily relate to the continued development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms, data services and clearing houses.Financing Activities Consolidated net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to $949 million in net repayments under our commercial paper program, $409 million in dividend and dividend equivalent payments to our shareholders, $54 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises and $50 million in repurchases of common stock. See “- Debt” below.Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily relates to $2.5 billion in net proceeds received in connection with the offering of new senior notes and $1.7 billion in net borrowings under our commercial paper program, partially offset by $1.0 billion in net repayments under our debt facilities, $660 million in repurchases of common stock, $331 million in dividend and dividend equivalent payments to our shareholders, $128 million for the purchase of subsidiary shares from non-controlling interest holders (for the purchase of the NYSE Amex Options shares) and $45 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises.Consolidated net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2014 primarily relates to $552 million in net repayments of our debt facilities and commercial paper, $645 million in repurchases of common stock, $299 million in dividend and dividend equivalent payments to our shareholders, $129 million in purchases of subsidiary shares from non-controlling interest holders (for the purchase of the NYSE Amex Options shares) and $45 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises. Discontinued Operations We did not have any cash provided by or used in any activities from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Consolidated net cash provided by (used in) operating activities, investing activities and financing activities from discontinued operations was $51 million, ($504 million) and $339 million, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2014. The $504 million in net cash used in investing activities primarily relates to $220 million of cash distributed from Euronext to us as part of the separation of Euronext from our remaining businesses and $262 million in cash retained by Euronext and removed from our balance sheet in the de-consolidation. The $339 million in net cash provided by financing activities relates to cash proceeds received from the issuance of debt by Euronext just prior to the IPO.Debt Our total debt, including short-term and long-term debt, consisted of the following as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 (in millions):67 As of December 31, 2016 2015Debt: Commercial Paper$1,642 $2,591NYSE USD Notes (2.00% senior unsecured notes due October 5, 2017)851 —Short-term debt 2,493 2,591NYSE USD Notes (2.00% senior unsecured notes due October 5, 2017)— 8522018 Senior Notes (2.50% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2018) 598 5972020 Senior Notes (2.75% senior unsecured notes due December 1, 2020)1,242 1,2392023 Senior Notes (4.00% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2023) 790 7892025 Senior Notes (3.75% senior unsecured notes due December 1, 2025)1,241 1,240Long-term debt3,871 4,717Total debt$6,364 $7,308Credit FacilityWe have entered into a $3.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, with a maturity date of November 13, 2020, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or Wells Fargo, as administrative agent, issuing lender and swing line lender, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available for borrowing by up to $1.0 billion, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions. On November 13, 2015, we utilized this option to increase the amount of the Credit Facility to $3.4 billion. The commitments under the Credit Facility will automatically reduce to $3.17 billion on April 3, 2019. No amounts were outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. The Credit Facility provides for a $3.4 billion multi-currency revolving facility, with sub-limits for non-dollar borrowings and letters of credit and with a swing-line facility available on a same-day basis. Of the $3.4 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the Credit Facility, $1.6 billion is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2016. The amount required to back-stop the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining $1.8 billion available under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2016 is available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.Borrowings under the Credit Facility will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate or (b) a “base rate” plus an applicable margin rate; provided, however, that all loans denominated in a foreign currency will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate. The “base rate” equals the higher of (i) Wells Fargo’s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) the one month LIBOR rate plus 1.00%. The applicable margin rate is based upon our public long term debt ratings and ranges from 0.875% to 1.50% on LIBOR borrowings and from 0.00% to 0.50% on base rate borrowings.The Credit Facility includes an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount, multiplied by an applicable commitment fee rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. The applicable commitment fee rate ranges from 0.08% to 0.20% and is determined based on our long term debt rating. As of December 31, 2016, the applicable commitment fee rate was 0.125% based on our current long term debt ratings. Commercial Paper ProgramWe have entered into a U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program. Our Commercial Paper Program is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the Credit Facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short term interest rates (such as USD LIBOR). The fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense. We used net proceeds from notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2016 for the $431 million cash purchase price of the Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. We used net proceeds from notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2015 to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price of the Interactive Data acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses, to repurchase our common stock, and for general corporate purposes. We used net proceeds from notes issued under the Commercial 68Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2014 to repay amounts outstanding under our prior credit facilities that were terminated in connection with us entering into the Credit Facility, to fund certain of our acquisitions, and to repurchase our common stock. We repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 with cash flows from operations and a portion of our unrestricted cash balances. We also repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2014 using a combination of the cash proceeds received from the IPO and sale of Euronext, and the sale of NYSE Technologies. Commercial paper notes of $1.6 billion with original maturities ranging from 3 to 68 days were outstanding as of December 31, 2016 under the Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.6 billion outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program was 0.74% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 18 days. Commercial paper notes with original maturities ranging from 2 to 89 days were outstanding as of December 31, 2015 under the Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2015, the weighted average interest rate on the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program was 0.60% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 19 days. 364 Day FacilityOn November 13, 2015, we entered into a $500 million 364 day senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the 364 Day Facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo, as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, and the lenders signatory thereto. The amounts available under the 364 Day Facility were available for use by us for working capital and general corporate purposes but specifically excluding any use to back-stop amounts issued under the Commercial Paper Program. The 364 Day Credit Facility expired on November 13, 2016.Senior NotesIn November 2015, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate senior notes, including $1.25 billion principal amount of 2.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due November 2020, or the 2020 Senior Notes, and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due November 2025, or the 2025 Senior Notes. We used the net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes offering, together with $1.6 billion of borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program, to finance the $4.1 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of Interactive Data. In October 2013, we issued $600 million principal amount of 2.50% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due October 2018, or the 2018 Senior Notes, and $800 million principal amount of 4.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due October 2023, or the 2023 Senior Notes. We used the net proceeds from the 2018 Senior Notes and 2023 Senior Notes offering to finance, together with cash on hand, the $2.7 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of NYSE. NYSE NotesIn connection with our acquisition of NYSE, one of our subsidiaries assumed the outstanding NYSE debt instruments, which included $850 million of 2.0% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in October 2017, or the NYSE USD Notes, and €920 million ($1.1 billion) of 5.375% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in June 2015, or the NYSE EUR Notes, and together with the NYSE USD Notes, the NYSE Notes. On June 30, 2015, we repaid the NYSE EUR Notes using cash that had been set aside in July 2014 from the proceeds of the Euronext IPO. The cash, in the amount of €969 million ($1.2 billion) had been placed in term deposits that matured on June 25, 2015. The cash was sufficient to settle the principal maturity of €920 million ($1.1 billion) and the final interest coupon of €49 million ($60 million).Refer to note 9 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional information on our debt and debt facilities. Future Capital Requirements Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our trading and clearing and data and listings segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business, potential stock repurchases, and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. We currently expect to make aggregate operational capital expenditures and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between $280 million and $300 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses. In addition, we currently expect between $40 million to $45 million in real estate capital expenditures during 2017 for leasehold improvements primarily associated with our New York headquarters. 69Our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board of directors or audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we paid cash dividends of $0.68 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including 2016 quarterly dividends of $0.17 per share, for an aggregate payout of $409 million in 2016, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. Refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last two years. For the first quarter of 2017, we announced a $0.20 per share dividend, which is a 18% increase over the prior dividend, which is payable on March 31, 2017 to shareholders of record as of March 16, 2017.As of December 31, 2016, we had $6.4 billion in outstanding debt. We currently have a $3.4 billion Credit Facility. After factoring in the $1.6 billion required to backstop the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2016, $1.8 billion of our Credit Facility is currently available for general corporate purposes. The Credit Facility and our Commercial Paper Program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources. In the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. However, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. See “- Debt” above.In connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we assumed NYSE’s pension plans covering its U.S. and certain European operations. The benefit accrual for the U.S. operations pension plan is frozen. Following the Euronext IPO in June 2014, there are no longer any NYSE European operations covered by the pension plans. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we contributed $10 million to our pension plans. Our practice is to fund our frozen defined benefit pension plan each year at a level above the minimum required contribution but within tax deductible limits. Based on actuarial projections, we estimate that a contribution of $10 million in 2017 will allow us to meet our funding goal. However, the actual contribution is contingent on the actual plan performance relative to assumptions. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We strongly recommend that investors review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.Adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ICE common shareholders from continuing operations and adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below, which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts). All share and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the 5-for-1 stock split that was effected in the fourth quarter of 2016:70 Trading and Clearing Segment Data and Listings

those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. However, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to NYSE and Interactive Data are included in non-GAAP adjustments given the sizes of these acquisitions. As of December 31, 2016, the integration of NYSE has been completed and we will no longer include any NYSE integration costs as non-GAAP adjustments in the future. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-GAAP adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results.During the year ended December 31, 2016, we also include as non-GAAP adjustments the Creditex U.K. voice brokerage severance costs related to its discontinuance and the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense, as they are not part of our core business operations. During the year and/or three months ended December 31, 2015, we also include as non-GAAP adjustments various litigation settlements and accruals and the interest expense on the senior notes and commercial paper we issued for the Interactive Data acquisition (from the issuance date of the new senior notes on November 24, 2015 and on the issuance dates of the commercial paper in early December 2015 to the acquisition date of Interactive Data on December 14, 2015), as they are not part of our core business operations. During the year and three months ended December 31, 2014, we also include as non-GAAP adjustments the net gain on the sale of our 6% remaining ownership in Euronext and the income recognized on our OCC equity investment, as they are not part of our core business operations. 72The income tax effects relating to the items above are included in non-GAAP adjustments as well as deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles and other tax adjustments. The tax items in non-GAAP adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments or are tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance. Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles relates primarily to future U.K. corporate income tax rate reductions with deferred tax benefits of $34 million and $60 million for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Further, deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include the impact of U.S. state tax law and apportionment changes which resulted in a deferred tax expense of $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and a deferred tax benefit of $22 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Other tax adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2016 relate to a $15 million valuation allowance on Singapore pre-acquisition net operating losses and other deferred tax assets and an $8 million deferred tax adjustment with respect to our OCC equity method investment. Other tax adjustments for year ended December 31, 2015 represents a $7 million uncertain tax position relating to a retrospective foreign tax law change for a pre-acquisition period and for the year ended December 31, 2014, represents $12 million of foreign tax expense in connection with the IPO of Euronext and the integration of Liffe. For additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “- Consolidated Operating Expenses”, “- Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” and “- Income Tax Provision” above.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table presents, for the periods indicated, our contractual obligations (which we intend to fund from our existing cash as well as cash flow from operations) and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2016 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 YearsContractual Obligations: Short-term and long-term debt and interest $7,225 $2,639 $2,205 $158 $2,223Operating lease obligations 612 85 148 113 266Purchase obligations118 83 35 — —Other liabilities and commitments 20 20 — — —Total contractual cash obligations $7,975 $2,827 $2,388 $271 $2,489Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.We have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above $55.2 billion in cash margin deposits and guaranty fund liabilities. Clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. The cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits and guaranty funds’ liabilities. We have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or UTBs, from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above. As of December 31, 2016, our cumulative UTBs were $112 million. Interest and penalties related to UTBs were $35 million as of December 31, 2016. We are under examination by various tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict, the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. It is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our UTBs. 73As of December 31, 2016, in connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. See note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs. We have a 40% ownership in OCC. Under the OCC's capital plan, the OCC shareholders have committed to contribute up to $200 million in equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by NYSE. New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to the accounting matters described below. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments. Based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. The values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets We have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. As of December 31, 2016, we had goodwill of $12.3 billion and net other intangible assets of $10.4 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and Internet domain names from various third parties. We do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. In performing the purchase price allocation, we consider, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. At the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation. We continue to review and validate estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period. Accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to 74benefit from the business combination. We had previously identified three reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our CDS reporting unit, and our cash listings reporting unit. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we conducted a review to determine the appropriate reporting units as a result of operating under two business segments effective January 1, 2016 and following our acquisition of Interactive Data in December 2015. This review has led to the identification of four reporting units: our futures reporting unit, our CDS reporting unit, our cash reporting unit, and our data and listings reporting unit. Goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. The initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. However, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. For annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. Otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. For annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount. Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. These estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. Future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill through December 31, 2016. We are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. If an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. Fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis. Among our finite-lived intangible assets, during the year ended December 31, 2015, we performed an undiscounted cash flow analysis to test whether the CDS Creditex customer relationship intangible asset was recoverable as we concluded that indicators of impairment were present. CDS trade execution revenues at Creditex have decreased over the last several years as trading volumes in the global CDS market have declined and CDS trading remains muted due to financial reform implementation and lower volatility in corporate credit markets. We identified the decline in revenues and the delay in their expected recovery as a triggering event requiring our Creditex customer relationship intangible asset to be tested for recoverability. As of December 31, 2015, the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset had a remaining net book value of $61 million and will become fully amortized in August 2020. The results of the recoverability test indicated that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of the asset by 8%. Therefore, no impairment was recorded for the year ended December 31, 2015.In August 2016, we sold certain of Creditex’s U.S. voice brokerage operations to Tullett Prebon. During the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued Creditex’s U.K. voice brokerage operations. We continue to operate Creditex's electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property. We continued to monitor potential impairment triggering events in our CDS trade execution business during 2016, including the impacts of divesting the brokerage business, changes in the business and regulatory climate in which the remaining business operates, the volatility in the capital markets, our recent operating performance and our current financial projections. Based on an analysis of these factors, it was determined that the carrying value of the CDS Creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in September 2016 for $33 million. The impairment was recorded as amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2016, the remaining Creditex customer relationship intangible asset is $14 million and will continue to be amortized over the remaining useful life through August 2020. 75Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., U.K. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse. We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. The undistributed earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no provision for U.S. federal and state income taxes has been made in our consolidated financial statements. A distribution of these non-U.S. earnings in the form of dividends, or otherwise, could subject us to both U.S. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for non-U.S. tax credits, and withholding taxes payable to the various non-U.S. countries. Determination of the amount of any unrecognized deferred income tax liability on these undistributed earnings is not practicable. We operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. ITEM 7 (A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments were $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of which $294 million and $439 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or Canadian dollars. The remaining cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. A hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $3 million as of December 31, 2016, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments. Our investment in Cetip, which is recorded as an available-for-sale long-term investment, was valued at $432 million as of December 31, 2016, including an accumulated unrealized gain of $108 million. Changes in the fair value of the Cetip investment are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income and do not impact earnings, except to the extent that unrealized losses are deemed to be other than temporary. As of December 31, 2016, we had $6.4 billion in outstanding debt, of which $3.9 billion relates to senior notes and $851 million relates to the NYSE Notes, all of which bear interest at fixed interest rates. The remaining amount outstanding of $1.6 billion relates to 76the Commercial Paper Program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2016 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $16 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. The interest rates on our Commercial Paper Program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. See Item 7 “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Debt” included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk As an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. Certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. Our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates): Year Ended December 31, 2016 Year Ended December 31, 2015 Pound Sterling Euro Pound Sterling EuroAverage exchange rate to the U.S. dollar $1.3603 $1.1075 $1.5292 $1.1117Average exchange rate to the U.S. dollar for the prior year$1.5292 $1.1117 $1.6481 $1.3300Average exchange rate change from prior year(11)% —% (7)% (16)%Foreign denominated percentage of: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses10 % 5% 11 % 4 %Operating expenses14 % 4% 10 % 2 %Operating income7 % 7% 11 % 7 %Impact of the currency fluctuations (1) on: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses$(58) $(1) $(27) $(28)Operating expenses$(40) $— $(12) $(5)Operating income$(18) $(1) $(15) $(23)(1)Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.We have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 15% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 18% of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. We have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We had foreign currency transaction losses of $1 million, $14 million and $2 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar, which strengthened. A 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2016 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $1 million, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity.We entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. Although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities. We have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. Our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions):77 As of December 31, 2016 Position in Pounds Sterling Position in EurosAssets£1,283 €240 of which goodwill represents522 43Liabilities122 110Net currency position£1,161 €130Impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates$143 $14As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $345 million and $45 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, we had net exposure of pounds sterling and euro of £1.2 billion ($1.4 billion) and €130 million ($137 million), respectively. Based on these December 31, 2016 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of pound sterling against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $143 million and a hypothetical 10% decrease of euro against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $14 million. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, currency exchange rate differences had a negative impact of $300 million, $58 million and $130 million, respectively, on our consolidated equity. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to the decrease in the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate to 1.2336 as of December 31, 2016 (from 1.4868 as of December 31, 2015) due to the weakening pound sterling. The pound sterling decreased starting in June 2016 following the U.K. referendum that resulted in a vote for the U.K. to leave the European Union. The future impact on our business relating to the U.K. leaving the European Union and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.Credit Risk We are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. Our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. We seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.Clearing House Cash Deposit RisksOur clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. Refer to note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information about clearing house cash deposits, which were $55.2 billion as of December 31, 2016. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.Credit RiskWhen a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits reflecting a number of factors including ratings assigned by rating agencies, CDS spreads and internal ratings, as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. We seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) to avoid a concentration of risk.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. To mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a 78manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price. Our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments of cash deposits. For example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. In addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, U.S. Treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (Euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities. Security Issuer RiskSecurity issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments. Investment Counterparty RiskInvestment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral under the repurchase agreement to high quality issuers. When engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts under clearing house control. Additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. The typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty’s obligation to the clearing house.Our clearing houses may use third party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided to them by the clearing house. Such investment advisors do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments. Clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control. Clearing house property is held with credit worthy custodians including JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., Citibank N.A., BNY Mellon, BMO Harris N.A. and Euroclear Bank Brussels (for non-U.S. dollar deposits). Each clearing house employs (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single investment advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional investment advisors or custodians are available as alternatives. Cross-Currency Margin Deposit RiskEach of our clearing houses, pursuant to their rules, may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in U.S. dollars to secure a Euro margin obligation). The clearing houses mitigate the risk of a decline in currency value by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of high currency volatility. Cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.Impact of Inflation We have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant or to decline. In the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.79",2023-12-30 20:40:53.759842
1571949,ICE,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.",2018,"ITEM 7.MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading “Forward Looking Statements” at the beginning of Part 1 of this Annual Report and in Item 1(A) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in Item 6 “Selected Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview We are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity, fixed income and equity markets. We operate regulated marketplaces for listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives and securities contracts across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, interest rates, equities, equity derivatives, ETFs, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. We also offer end-to-end data services and solutions to support the trading, investment, risk management and connectivity needs of customers around the world across all major asset classes.Our exchanges include derivative exchanges in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada and Singapore, and cash equities, equity options and bond exchanges in the U.S. We also operate OTC markets for physical energy and CDS trade execution. To serve global derivatives markets, we operate central counterparty clearing houses in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada and Singapore. We offer a range of data services for global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, desktops and connectivity solutions. Through our markets, clearing houses, listings and market data services, we provide end-to-end solutions for our customers through liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets, and related services to support their ability to manage risk and raise capital. Our business is currently conducted as two reportable business segments, our Trading and Clearing segment and our Data and Listings segment, and the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S. and U.K. Recent Developments U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs ActOn December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, was signed into law. The TCJA reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. We are required to revalue our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at the new federal corporate income tax rate as of the date of enactment of the TCJA and to include the rate change effect in the tax provision for the period ended December 31, 2017. As a result, we recognized a $764 million deferred tax benefit based on a reasonable estimate of the deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 22, 2017. This significantly reduced the effective tax rate for the period ended December 31, 2017 in comparison to the effective tax rates for the last two comparable periods. As part of U.S. international tax reform, the TCJA imposes a transition tax on certain accumulated foreign earnings aggregated across all non-U.S. subsidiaries, net of foreign deficits. As we are in an aggregate net foreign deficit position for U.S. tax purposes, we are not liable for the transition tax. See “- Consolidated Income Tax Provision” below.Divestiture of Trayport and the Acquisitions of NGX and Shorcan Energy On December 11, 2015, we acquired 100% of Trayport in a stock transaction. The total purchase price was $620 million, comprised of 12.6 million shares of our common stock. Trayport is a software company that licenses its technology to serve exchanges, OTC brokers and traders to facilitate electronic and hybrid trade execution primarily in the energy markets. The CMA undertook a review of our acquisition of Trayport under the merger control laws of the U.K. In October 2016, the CMA issued its findings and ordered a divestment of Trayport to remedy what the CMA determined to be a substantial lessening of competition. In November 2016, we filed an appeal with the U.K. Competition Appeal Tribunal, or the CAT, to challenge the CMA’s decision. In March 2017, the CAT upheld the CMA decision that we should divest Trayport. Following the CAT’s judgment, we asked for leave to appeal the CAT’s decision at the U.K. Court of Appeals. In May 2017, the U.K. Court of Appeals denied our request for leave to appeal and we were obligated to sell Trayport by January 2018. 40On December 14, 2017, we sold Trayport to TMX Group for £550 million ($733 million based on the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.3331 as of December 14, 2017). We recognized a net gain of $110 million on the divestiture of Trayport, which was recorded as other income within our Data and Listings segment in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2017. The net gain is equal to the $733 million in gross proceeds received less the adjusted carrying value of Trayport’s net assets of $607 million (which is equal to the $531 million carrying value of Trayport plus $76 million in accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation) and less $16 million in costs to sell Trayport. The gross proceeds included a combination of £350 million ($466 million) in cash and £200 million ($267 million) in value relating to our acquisitions of NGX and Shorcan Energy, both wholly-owned subsidiaries of TMX Group. Trayport was included in our Data and Listings segment and NGX and Shorcan Energy are included in our Trading and Clearing segment. NGX, headquartered in Calgary, provides electronic execution, central counterparty clearing and data services to the North American natural gas, electricity and oil markets. Shorcan Energy offers brokerage services for the North American crude oil markets. The functional currency of Trayport was the pound sterling, as this was the currency in which Trayport operated. The $620 million in Trayport net assets were recorded on our December 11, 2015 opening balance sheet at a pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.5218 (£407 million). Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we translated the Trayport net assets into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against the pound sterling affected the value of the Trayport balance sheet, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. As a result of the decrease in the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate to 1.3331 as of December 14, 2017, the portion of our equity attributable to the Trayport net assets in accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $76 million. In connection with the divestiture on December 14, 2017, the $76 million in the Trayport foreign currency translation loss was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive loss and recognized as part of the net gain on the divestiture as discussed above.As of June 30, 2017, we classified Trayport as held for sale and ceased depreciation and amortization of the property and equipment and other intangible assets. Subsequent to its divestiture on December 14, 2017, there are no longer any Trayport assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. Acquisition of BondPointOn January 2, 2018, we acquired 100% of BondPoint from Virtu Financial, Inc. for $400 million in cash. BondPoint is a leading provider of electronic fixed income trading solutions for the buy-side and sell-side offering access to centralized liquidity and automated trade execution services through its ATS and provides trading services to more than 500 financial services firms. Investment in EuroclearOn October 24, 2017, we acquired a 4.7% stake in Euroclear for €275 million in cash ($327 million based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.1903 as of October 24, 2017). During December 2017, we reached an agreement to buy an additional 5.1% stake in Euroclear for €243 million in cash ($292 million based on the euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.2003 as of December 31, 2017) and expect to receive necessary regulatory approval during the first quarter of 2018. Upon closing, we will own a 9.8% stake in Euroclear for a total investment of €518 million ($619 million based on the exchange rates above). Euroclear is a leading provider of post-trade services, including settlement, central securities depositories and related services for cross-border transactions across asset classes. Acquisition of Global Research Division’s Index Business from BofAMLOn October 20, 2017, we acquired BofAML’s Global Research division’s index business. BofAML indices are the second largest group of fixed income indices as measured by AUM globally. The AUM benchmarked against our combined fixed income indices is nearly $1 trillion, and the indices have been re-branded as the ICE BofAML indices. Purchase of Minority InterestsDuring June 2017, we purchased both N.V. Nederlandse Gasunie’s, or Gasunie, 21% minority ownership interest in ICE Endex and ABN AMRO Clearing Bank N.V.’s, or ABN AMRO Clearing, 25% minority ownership interest in ICE Clear Netherlands. Subsequent to these acquisitions, we own 100% of ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands and will no longer include any non-controlling interest amounts for ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased 12.6% of the net profit sharing interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries from several non-ICE limited partners and the remaining non-ICE limited partners hold a 29.9% net profit sharing interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. See “- Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expense)” below.41Divestiture of NYSE Governance ServicesOn June 1, 2017, we sold NYSE Governance Services to Marlin Heritage, L.P. NYSE Governance Services provides governance and compliance analytics and education solutions for organizations and their boards of directors through dynamic learning solutions. We recognized a net loss of $6 million on the divestiture of NYSE Governance Services, which was recorded as amortization expense within our Data and Listings segment in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2017.Acquisition of TMX AtriumOn May 1, 2017, we acquired 100% of TMX Atrium, a global extranet and wireless services business, from TMX Group. TMX Atrium provides low-latency access to markets and market data across 12 countries, more than 30 major trading venues, and ultra-low latency wireless connectivity to access markets and market data in the Toronto, New Jersey and Chicago metro areas. The wireless assets consist of microwave and millimeter networks that transport market data and provide private bandwidth. TMX Atrium is now part of ICE Data Services and is being integrated with our connectivity services. Divestiture of Interactive Data Managed SolutionsOn March 31, 2017, we sold Interactive Data Managed Solutions, or IDMS, a unit of Interactive Data, to FactSet. IDMS is a managed solutions and portal provider for the global wealth management industry. There was no gain or loss recognized on the sale of IDMS.Cetip Investment GainUntil March 29, 2017, we held a 12% ownership interest in Cetip, which we classified as an available-for-sale long-term investment. On March 29, 2017, Cetip and BM&FBOVESPA S.A. finalized a merger agreement. BM&FBOVESPA S.A., which changed its name to B3 S.A. - Brasil, Bolsa, Balcao, or B3, following the merger with Cetip, is a stock exchange and operator of registration, clearing, custodial and settlement services for equities, financial securities, indices, rates, commodities and currencies and is located in São Paulo, Brazil. The merger valued our Cetip investment at $500 million. We received the proceeds in cash and in B3 common stock. The cash component was valued at $319 million, which was subject to Brazilian capital gains tax of $28 million that was remitted to the Brazilian tax authorities in March 2017. We received net cash proceeds in April 2017 of $286 million, which is net of a foreign exchange loss of $6 million that was incurred in April 2017. We received 29,623,756 B3 common shares valued at their quoted market price of $181 million. In April 2017, we sold the B3 common shares for net proceeds of $152 million, which is net of a capital gain tax of $26 million that was remitted to the Brazilian tax authorities and further transaction expenses of $3 million that were incurred in April 2017. We used the $438 million in net cash and stock proceeds received from the merger and sale of B3 shares to pay down amounts outstanding under our U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program, and for share repurchases. The $500 million fair value of our investment in Cetip included an accumulated unrealized gain of $176 million, based on the $324 million cost basis. In connection with the sale of our equity investment in Cetip, the $176 million accumulated unrealized gain was reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income and was recognized in other income as a realized investment gain in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2017. Refer to note 6 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the Cetip investment gain.Acquisition of National Stock ExchangeOn January 31, 2017, we acquired 100% of National Stock Exchange, Inc., now named NYSE National. The acquisition gives the NYSE Group a fourth U.S. exchange license. NYSE National is distinct from NYSE Group’s three listings exchanges because NYSE National will only be a trading venue and will not be a listings market. NYSE Group’s three listings exchanges, NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, have unique market models designed for corporate and ETF issuers. After closing the transaction, NYSE National ceased operations on February 1, 2017. Subject to regulatory approvals, NYSE Group anticipates re-launching operations on NYSE National, Inc. in the second quarter of 2018.42Consolidated Financial HighlightsThe following charts and table summarize our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change 2016 2015 ChangeRevenues, less transaction-based expenses $4,629 $4,499 3 % $4,499 $3,338 35%Operating expenses $2,250 $2,332 (3)% $2,332 $1,588 47%Adjusted operating expenses(1)$1,938 $1,947 — % $1,947 $1,365 43%Operating income $2,379 $2,167 10 % $2,167 $1,750 24%Adjusted operating income(1)$2,691 $2,552 5 % $2,552 $1,973 29%Operating margin 51 % 48 % 3 pts 48 % 52 % (4 pts)Adjusted operating margin(1)58 % 57 % 1 pt 57 % 59 % (2 pts)Other income (expense), net $138 (138) n/a (138) (97) 42%Income tax expense (benefit)$(25) $580 n/a $580 $358 62%Effective tax rate (1)% 29% (30 pts) 29% 22% 7 ptsNet income attributable to ICE$2,514 $1,422 77 % $1,422 $1,274 12%Adjusted net income attributable to ICE(1)$1,752 $1,665 5 % $1,665 1,359 23%Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common shareholders$4.23 $2.37 78 % $2.37 $2.28 4%Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common shareholders(1)$2.95 $2.78 6 % $2.78 $2.43 14%Cash flows from operating activities$2,085 $2,149 (3)% $2,149 $1,311 64%(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts and table above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, and for adjusted net income attributable to ICE and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common shareholders, are presented net of taxes. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. •Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016. See “- Trading and Clearing Segment” and “Data and Listings Segment” below for a discussion of the significant changes in our revenues. The increase in revenues includes $22 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects 43arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016. See Item 7(A) “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.•Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to our acquisitions of Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis, and to a lesser extent, revenue increases in our exchange-related data services and Brent crude and agricultural transaction and clearing. We recognized $1.1 billion in Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis data services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $50 million in Interactive Data and Trayport data services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions in December 2015. The increase in revenues includes $59 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. •Operating expenses decreased $82 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a $33 million Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment. See “- Consolidated Operating Expenses” below for a discussion of the other significant changes in our operating expenses. The decrease in operating expenses includes $14 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016. •Operating expenses increased $744 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to increased operating expenses relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and $33 million relating to the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment recorded in September 2016. Excluding acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, we recognized $812 million in Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $39 million in Interactive Data and Trayport operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions in December 2015. These increases were partially offset by decreases in professional services expenses and selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Also partially offsetting the operating expense increases were favorable foreign exchange effects of $40 million arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015.•In connection with Cetip’s merger with BM&FBOVESPA S.A., now B3, we recognized a $167 million net realized investment gain in other income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017. We also recognized a net gain of $110 million in connection with our divestiture of Trayport in other income (expense), net for the year ended December 31, 2017. See “- Recent Developments” above.•The lower effective tax rates and income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2015 are primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with future U.S. income tax rate reductions of $764 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and the deferred tax benefit associated with future U.K. income tax rate reductions along with certain favorable settlements with various taxing authorities of $75 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. See “- Consolidated Income Tax Provision” below.Business Environment and Market TrendsOur business environment has been characterized by industry consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings; the globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; market participants’ rising demand for speed, data capacity and connectivity, which requires ongoing investment in technology; evolving and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions; and increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies. Price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk through trading and clearing. Market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market’s strength. In addition, the ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs, develop new products and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing, exclusivity and consolidation is important to our business. Changes in these and other factors could cause our revenues to fluctuate from period to period and these fluctuations may affect the reliability of period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results. For additional information regarding the factors that affect our results of operations, see Item 1(A) “- Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.The implementation of new laws or regulations or the uncertainty around potential changes may impact participation in our markets, or the demand for our clearing and data services either favorably or unfavorably. Many of the recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented on January 3, 2018 are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have 44not been fully harmonized and several of the MiFID II regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As this is established, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” included elsewhere in this Annual Report, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.In recent years, low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow or yet to occur global economic recovery. Lower growth in Asia and the EU may also continue to affect global financial markets. In addition, economic and regulatory uncertainty, coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events, low interest rates and low natural gas prices, has affected our clients’ activities in recent years. The duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business across trading and listings. We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 21% in 2013 to 58% in 2017. This non-transaction revenue includes data services, listings and other revenues. We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing and markets.Many of the data products and services we sell are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: increasing global regulatory demands; greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; greater emphasis on risk management; market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; the move to passive investing and indexation; ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; increased electronification of fixed income and other less automated markets; the development of new data products; the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; new entrants; and increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions. We contract with clients through data fixed-fee subscriptions, variable fees based on usage or a combination of fixed-fee subscription and usage-based fees. In addition, some of our data services generate one-time or non-recurring revenue, such as one-time purchases of historical data, set-up services or implementation fees.Segment Reporting We operate two business segments: our Trading and Clearing segment and our Data and Listings segment. This presentation is reflective of how our chief operating decision maker reviews and operates our business. Our Trading and Clearing segment comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses. Our Data and Listings segment comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses. Our chief operating decision maker does not review total assets, intersegment revenues/expenses or statements of income below operating income by segments; therefore, such information is not presented below. While revenues are allocated directly to segments, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments. Because these expenses do not relate to a single segment, we have employed a reasonable allocation method to allocate expenses between the segments for presentation purposes. We have elected to use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment. Further, precise allocation of expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments is not reasonably possible. Accordingly, we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within the segments.Certain prior year’s segment expenses for 2016 have been reclassified to conform to our current year’s segment financial statement presentation. This reclassification increased the operating expenses for the Data and Listings segment by $55 million, while decreasing the operating expenses for the Trading and Clearing segment by the same amount. 45Trading and Clearing SegmentThe following charts and table present our selected statements of income data for our Trading and Clearing segment (dollars in millions):(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.46 Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change 2016 2015 ChangeRevenues: Energy futures and options contracts$909 $865 5 % $865 $804 7 %Agricultural and metals futures and options contracts216 228 (5) 228 211 8Interest rates and other financial futures and options contracts326 318 2 318 342 (6)Cash equities and equity options1,491 1,780 (16) 1,780 1,676 6Other transactions189 193 (1) 193 195 (1)Transaction and clearing, net 3,131 3,384 (7) 3,384 3,228 5Other revenues 202 177 14 177 178 —Revenues3,333 3,561 (6) 3,561 3,406 5Transaction-based expenses 1,205 1,459 (17) 1,459 1,344 9Revenues, less transaction-based expenses2,128 2,102 1 % 2,102 2,062 2 %Other operating expenses590 571 3 % 571 670 (15)%Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs2 10 (83)% 10 28 (64)%Depreciation and amortization (including impairment)187 244 (23)% 244 217 12 %Operating expenses779 825 (6)% 825 915 (10)%Operating income$1,349 $1,277 6 % $1,277 $1,147 11 %Transaction and Clearing RevenuesOverviewOur transaction and clearing revenues are reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below, and consist of fees collected from our derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing. In our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared, and in our equity and equity options markets, we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution. Rates per-contract are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and due to product mix. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 20%, 19% and 20%, respectively, of our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the U.S. dollar, our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were lower by $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016, and were lower by $35 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015. See Item 7(A) “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.Our transaction and clearing fees are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $749 million, $674 million and $563 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs. Commodities MarketsWe operate global crude oil and refined oil futures markets, including the ICE Brent, ICE WTI and ICE Gasoil futures and options contracts, as well as over 500 refined oil futures products that relate to our benchmark futures contracts and other key price benchmarks. The ICE Brent crude contract is relied upon by a broad range of global market participants, including oil producing nations and multinational companies, to price and hedge their crude oil production and consumption. ICE Gasoil is a key refined 47oil benchmark in Europe and Asia. Total oil volume and revenues increased 14% and 12%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 12% and 10%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Crude oil revenues grew at a slightly lower rate due to customer and product mix.In 2017, ICE Brent crude futures and options contracts were traded at record levels for the twenty-first consecutive year. ICE Brent crude futures and options volume increased 15% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 15% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. ICE WTI crude futures and options volume increased 14% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 16% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. ICE Brent crude and ICE WTI crude futures and options volume increased primarily due to increased oil price volatility related to shifting supply and demand dynamics globally; broader market volatility in oil products, equities and foreign exchange rates; acts of central governments; outcomes of elections; and uncertainty around the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, policy. Our global natural gas futures and options volume declined 1% and revenues decreased 1% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, respectively, and volume declined 2% and revenues increased 4% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, respectively. Global natural gas revenues decreased in 2017 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation in our European natural gas products. Global natural gas volume declined in 2016 primarily due to lower price volatility related to high natural gas supplies but revenues increased due to geographic product mix. Total volume and revenues in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets decreased 7% and 5%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased 11% and 8%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. The decreases in agricultural volume in 2017 were primarily driven by the reduced price volatility in 2017 compared to the higher price volatility in 2016. The increases in agricultural volume in 2016 were primarily driven by increased price volatility due to changing supply and demand expectations largely related to weather and production levels. Financial MarketsInterest rates and other financial futures and options volume and revenues increased 15% and 2%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and volume increased 10% and revenues decreased 6%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Interest rate futures and options volume increased in 2017 primarily due to expectations for heightened central bank activity during 2017, and volume increased in 2016 primarily due to uncertainty around central bank actions, economic data during 2016, and the U.K.’s decision to exit the EU. Interest rate futures and options revenues increased less than traded volumes in 2017 and in 2016 primarily due to the impact of foreign currency translation and increased market making rebates that apply at higher volume levels. Cash equities handled volume decreased 17% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to a reduction in U.S. equities market volatility during 2017 compared to the prior year. Cash equities handled volume increased 6% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to increased market volatility throughout 2016. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $196 million, $223 million and $220 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Equity options volume decreased 13% for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period in 2016, and decreased 5% for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $90 million, $98 million and $112 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Equity options volume and revenues decreased the last several years primarily due to lower U.S. equity market volatility in 2017 and the restructuring of the NYSE American Options business. While revenues declined the last several years, the overall financial contribution of equity options was consistent with the prior years due to the retention of a higher percentage of profits from NYSE American Options driven by our repurchase of the equity in the exchange from the minority shareholders.CDS clearing revenues were $113 million, $107 million and $100 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The notional value of CDS cleared during the same periods were $11.5 trillion, $11.5 trillion and $11.9 trillion, respectively. Buy-side participation at our U.S. CDS clearing house, ICE Clear Credit, reached record levels in terms of number of participants and notional cleared due to increased participation from both U.S. and European buy-side customers due to greater regulatory certainty, the breadth of products offered, and cost efficient margining in the U.S. relative to Europe. CDS trade execution revenues were $27 million, $36 million and $49 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. CDS trading remains muted due to financial reform and lower volatility in corporate credit markets. The 48decrease in the CDS trade execution revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 is also impacted by the sale and discontinuance of our U.S. and U.K. CDS voice brokerage operations in the third quarter of 2016. Other RevenuesOther revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. The increase in other revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to a $6 million breakup fee received in the third quarter of 2017 related to the termination of the derivatives clearing agreement with Euronext, under which ICE Clear Netherlands was to provide clearing of Euronext’s financial and commodity derivatives.Selected Operating DataThe following charts and table present trading activity in our futures and options markets by commodity type based on the total number of contracts traded, as well as futures and options rate per contract (in millions, except for percentages and rate per contract amounts): Volume and Rate per Contract Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change 2016 2015 ChangeNumber of contracts traded: Energy futures and options 685 635 8 % 635 596 7 %Agricultural and metals futures and options 94 101 (7) 101 90 11Interest rates and other financial futures and options 647 564 15 564 514 10Total 1,426 1,300 10 % 1,300 1,200 8 % Rate per contract: Energy futures and options$1.33 $1.36 (2)% $1.36 $1.35 1 %Agricultural and metals futures and options$2.30 $2.27 1 % $2.27 $2.34 (3)%Interest rates and other financial futures and options$0.49 $0.54 (10)% $0.54 $0.63 (14)%Open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently open — in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange.

Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges. For NYSE cash equities, market share declined during 2017 due to historically low volatility driving more trading to off-exchange trading venues, particularly dark pools. For NYSE equity options, market share decreased due to a strategic focus on maximizing revenues in an extremely competitive environment. Transaction-Based Expenses Our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are designed to recover the government’s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities professionals. We, in turn, collect activity assessment fees, which are included in transaction and clearing revenues in our consolidated statements of income, from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges and recognize these amounts when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed so that they are equal to the Section 31 fees that are included in transaction-based expenses in our consolidated statements of income. As a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income. Activity assessment fees received are included in cash at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semi-annually and recorded as an accrued liability until paid. As of December 31, 2017, the accrued liability related to the un-remitted SEC Section 31 fees was $128 million.We also incur liquidity payments made to cash and options trading customers and routing charges made to other exchanges that are included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market 51for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue.Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginOur Trading and Clearing segment operating expenses decreased $46 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and decreased $90 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015 (with the 2016 decrease being partially offset by the $33 million Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense recorded in September 2016). See “- Consolidated Operating Expenses” below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses. Our Trading and Clearing segment operating income increased $72 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased $130 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Trading and Clearing segment operating margins were 63%, 61% and 56% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The operating income and operating margin increases the last two years were driven by the revenue increases discussed above and operating expense decreases discussed below.Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating expenses were $712 million, $715 million and $809 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating income was $1.4 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion for the years for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating margins were 67%, 66% and 61% for the years for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Through ICE Data Services, we generate revenues from a range of market data services, including the dissemination of our exchange and evaluated pricing data and analytics, desktops, connectivity and market data. Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 10%, 12% and 4%, respectively, of our Data and Listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros (all relating to our data services revenues). As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the U.S. dollar, our data services revenues were lower by $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016, and were lower by $24 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015. Data Services RevenuesOur pricing and analytics services consist of an extensive set of independent evaluated pricing services focused primarily on fixed income and international equity securities, valuation services, reference data, market data, end of day pricing, fixed income, equity portfolio analytics and risk management analytics. We also serve as an administrator of regulated benchmarks. Our index services offer a range of products across fixed income, energy, equities, ETFs and other asset classes to provide the methodology, pricing and licensing of indices and benchmarks.Our exchange data revenues primarily represent subscription fees for the provision of our market data that is created from activity on our exchanges, which is driven by the products and technology we develop to deliver real-time views of markets and related information. In our derivatives markets, exchange data revenues relate to subscription fees charged for customer and license access from third party data vendors, or quote vendors such as Thomson Reuters Corporation and Bloomberg, and from end users, as well as view-only data access, direct access services, terminal access, daily indices, forward curves, and end of day reports. We also earn exchange data revenues relating to our cash equity and options markets, and related data services. We collect cash trading market data fees principally for consortium-based data products and, to a lesser extent, for NYSE proprietary data 53products. Consortium-based data fees are determined by the securities industry plans and are charged to vendors based on their redistribution of data. Consortium-based data revenues (net of administrative costs) are distributed to participating securities markets on the basis of a formula set by the SEC under Regulation NMS. Last trade prices and quotes in NYSE-listed, NYSE American-listed, and NYSE Arca-listed securities are disseminated through “Tape A” and “Tape B,” which constitute the majority of our revenues from consortium-based market data revenues.Our desktop and connectivity services comprise technology-based information platforms, feeds and connectivity solutions. These include trading applications, desktop solutions, data feeds and infrastructure to support trading, voice brokers and investment functions. Our desktop and web-based applications deliver real-time market information, analytical and decision support tools to support trading and investment decisions. Through our consolidated feeds, clients receive market data from global exchanges, trading venues, news and data sources for exchange-traded and OTC markets. Our services offer clients a secure, resilient, private multi-participant network that provides access to global exchanges and content service providers. Our infrastructure managed services solution also offers colocation space, direct exchange access, proximity hosting and support services that enable access to real-time exchange data, and facilitates low latency, secure electronic market access. Our data services revenues increased the last two years primarily due to the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers, the development of new and enhanced products serving the need for an expanded range of data, regulatory compliance and analytics solutions, and our acquisitions of Interactive Data and Trayport in December 2015 and of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis in October 2016. These increases were partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and the divestitures of IDMS and Trayport in our desktop and connectivity business. We recognized $1.1 billion in data services revenues for Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $50 million in data services revenues for Interactive Data and Trayport from the comparable period in 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions dates. Organic Annual Subscription ValueOrganic Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues subscribed for the succeeding twelve months. ASV does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that twelve-month period. ASV also does not include certain data services revenue streams that are not subscription-based. ASV is adjusted for material acquisitions, divestitures or discontinued businesses to provide an organic view of comparable performance on a year over year basis at a beginning of the quarter. Thus, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a growth forecast of the next twelve months of data services revenues.As of December 31, 2017, ASV was $1.8 billion, a 6% increase compared to ASV of $1.7 billion as of December 31, 2016. Underpinning this growth is strength in both our pricing and analytics business and our connectivity services.Listings RevenuesWe recognize listings revenues in our securities markets from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges - original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. Initial listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of nine years for NYSE and five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE American. U.S. companies pay annual fees based on the number of outstanding shares the company has and non-U.S. companies pay annual fees based on the number of outstanding shares the company has issued or held in the U.S. Annual fees are recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis over the calendar year, and generally received as cash in the first quarter of the year. In addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Corporate actions-related listing fees are recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over estimated service periods of six years for NYSE and three years for NYSE Arca and NYSE American. Unamortized balances are recorded as deferred revenue in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginOur Data and Listings segment operating expenses decreased $36 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased $834 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. The increase in 2016 primarily relates to $812 million in operating expenses recognized relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $39 million in operating expenses recognized relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis for the comparable period in 2015 (both excluding acquisition-related transaction and integration costs). See “- Consolidated Operating 54Expenses” below for further details on the Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis operating expenses and for a discussion of the other significant changes in our operating expenses. Our Data and Listings segment operating income increased $140 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, and increased $287 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Data and Listings segment operating margins were 41%, 37% and 47% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The operating income and operating margin increases in 2017 were driven by the revenue increases discussed above and operating expense decreases discussed below.Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating expenses were $1.2 billion, $1.2 billion and $556 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion and $720 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating margins were 51%, 49% and 56% for the years for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.Consolidated Operating Expenses The majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance, as discussed below. The following chart and table present our consolidated operating expenses (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change 2016 2015 ChangeCompensation and benefits $937 $945 (1)% $945 $611 55 %Professional services 121 137 (12) 137 139 (1)Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs 36 80 (56) 80 88 (9)Technology and communication 397 374 6 374 203 84Rent and occupancy 69 70 (1) 70 57 21Selling, general and administrative 155 116 34 116 116 —Depreciation and amortization 535 610 (12) 610 374 63Total operating expenses $2,250 $2,332 (3)% $2,332 $1,588 47 %55We expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business, and to vary from year to year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, our integrations and other investments.For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 14%, 18% and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of operating expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro the last two years compared to the U.S. dollar, our consolidated operating expenses were lower by $14 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016, and were lower by $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 from the comparable period in 2015. See Item 7(A) “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information on the impact of currency fluctuations.Compensation and Benefits Expenses Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance and the performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year to year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees. As of December 31, 2017 we had 4,952 employees, compared to 5,631 employees as of December 31, 2016 and 5,549 employees as of December 31, 2015. Our employee headcount decreased as of December 31, 2017 primarily due to the divestitures in 2017 of IDMS, Trayport and NYSE Governance Services, and employee terminations in connection with our integration of Interactive Data, partially offset by the acquisitions of NGX and TMX Atrium in 2017. Our employee headcount increased as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 primarily due to acquisitions of Securities Evaluations, Credit Market Analysis, Interactive Data and Trayport during 2016 and 2015, converting contractor roles to employees at NYSE, and hiring for clearing, technology, regulation and compliance. See “- Recent Developments” above. Compensation and benefits expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the increases in our employee headcount. We recognized $342 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to the Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $17 million in compensation and benefits expenses relating to the Interactive Data and Trayport acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2015, subsequent to their acquisitions. We recorded $17 million, $33 million and $20 million in NYSE and Interactive Data employee severance costs during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with such costs included in the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs discussed below and primarily related to executive departures. In addition, we incurred non-acquisition-related employee severance costs of $21 million, $10 million and $3 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $135 million, $123 million and $111 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in non-cash compensation expenses in 2017 primarily relates to the integration of the Interactive Data employees into the ICE non-cash incentive plans, and the increase in 2016 primarily relates to a greater number of employees receiving non-cash awards due to the headcount increases discussed above.Professional Services Expenses This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees. This expense may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings. Professional services expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the continued reduction in professional services and contractors at NYSE. We eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with full-time employees at NYSE in 2016 and 2015. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded a credit from a third party service provider related to fees charged during 2015, and we incurred lower legal fees during the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015. Legal fees, which are included in professional services expenses, primarily related to class action lawsuits in which NYSE is a defendant. These decreases were partially offset by professional services expenses incurred by Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015. Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration CostsWe incurred $36 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily relating to our integrations of Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and our acquisitions of 56BondPoint, TMX Atrium, BofAML indices and NYSE National. Of this amount, $11 million was primarily related to the acquisitions. We incurred $25 million for Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. We incurred $80 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily relating to our integrations of Interactive Data and NYSE, legal and professional fees related to the Trayport CMA review, our investment in MERSCORP Holdings, Inc., owner of Mortgage Electronic Registrations Systems, Inc., or collectively MERS, our acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis, and various other potential and discontinued acquisitions. Of this amount, $41 million was primarily related to the acquisitions and other transaction costs. We incurred $39 million for Interactive Data and NYSE integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2016, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. As of December 31, 2016, the integration of NYSE has been completed and we will no longer include any NYSE integration costs in the future. We incurred $88 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily relating to our acquisitions of Interactive Data and Trayport and the integration of NYSE. Of this amount, $46 million was primarily related to the acquisition costs. We incurred $42 million for NYSE integration costs during the year ended December 31, 2015, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs.We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.Technology and Communication Expenses Technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.Technology and communications expenses increased the last two years primarily due to technology expenses incurred by Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015. In addition, during the last two years, we incurred increased hardware and software support costs related to our trading and clearing platforms and our data services.Rent and Occupancy ExpensesThis expense consists of costs related to leased and owned property including rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in and around Atlanta, New York and London with smaller offices located throughout the world. See Item 2 “- Properties” above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property. The increase in rent and occupancy expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to rent and occupancy expenses relating to Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis subsequent to their acquisitions. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, rent and occupancy expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to reduced rent and occupancy costs realized due to the continued consolidation of our Atlanta, New York and London office locations.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses This expense relates to expenses from marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and $14 million in accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries during the year ended December 31, 2017. Refer to note 14 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the ongoing investigations and inquiries. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to selling, general and administrative expenses incurred by Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis following their acquisitions in 2016 and 2015. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to the release of non-income tax-related reserves and lower marketing expenses. 57Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally developed and purchased software over their estimated useful lives. We recorded amortization expenses on the intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on the other intangible assets, of $272 million, $323 million and $160 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The decrease in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to a reduction in amortization expenses recorded on intangible assets which became fully amortized (primarily related to certain of the NYSE intangible assets) and the divestitures of Trayport and NYSE Governance Services, partially offset by amortization expenses recorded on the Securities Evaluations, Credit Market Analysis, NGX and TMX Atrium intangible assets. The increase in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to amortization expenses recorded on the Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis intangible assets, following their acquisitions.In addition, we recognized a net loss of $6 million on the sale of NYSE Governance Services, which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 (see “- Recent Developments” above), and we recorded an impairment of the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset of $33 million, which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. In August 2016, we sold certain of Creditex’s U.S. voice brokerage operations to Tullett Prebon. During the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued Creditex’s U.K. voice brokerage operations. We continue to operate Creditex’s electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property. In connection with the divestiture of the voice brokerage business, it was determined that the carrying value of the CDS Creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in September 2016 for $33 million. We recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $257 million, $254 million and $213 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, with the increase in 2016 primarily relating to our acquisitions of Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis.Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expenses) Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change 2016 2015 ChangeOther income (expense): Interest expense $(187) $(178) 5% $(178) $(97) 83%Other income, net 325 40 n/a 40 — n/aTotal other income (expense), net $138 $(138) n/a $(138) $(97) 42% Net income attributable to non-controlling interest $(28) $(27) 5% $(27) $(21) 28%Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to the $1.0 billion in senior notes issued in August 2017, partially offset by the repayment of $850 million of the 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due in October 2017, or the NYSE Notes, in September 2017. Interest expense increased for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, primarily due to the interest expense we recognized on the additional debt incurred to finance the Interactive Data acquisition in December 2015. See “- Debt” below. On December 14, 2017, we sold Trayport to TMX Group for £550 million ($733 million based on the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate of 1.3331 as of December 14, 2017). We recognized a net gain of $110 million on the divestiture of Trayport, which was recorded as other income for the year ended December 31, 2017. See “- Recent Developments - Divestiture of Trayport and the Acquisitions of NGX and Shorcan Energy” above. In connection with Cetip’s merger with BM&FBOVESPA S.A., now B3, and its subsequent sale, we recognized a $176 million realized investment gain in other income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and we recognized $9 million in foreign exchange losses and transaction expenses in other expense for the year ended December 31, 2017. See “- Recent Developments - Cetip 58Investment Gain” above. We recognized dividend income received relating to our investment in Cetip in other income, which was $5 million, $17 million and $16 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We no longer receive any dividends from Cetip subsequent to its sale in the first quarter of 2017. We account for our investments in MERS and The Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, as equity method investments. We recognized $36 million, $25 million and $6 million in equity income related to these investments during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, as other income. We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $4 million, $1 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. This was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense) and relate to the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. See Item 7A “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information on these items.We recognized interest income on our investments of $8 million, $3 million and $6 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which were recorded as other income. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we incurred $15 million in settlements and accruals for various outstanding legal matters (net of insurance proceeds), which was recorded in other expense. For consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, non-controlling interest included those related to the operating results of our CDS clearing subsidiaries in which non-ICE limited partners held a 42.5% net profit sharing interest; ICE Endex in which Gasunie held a 21% ownership interest; and ICE Clear Netherlands in which ABN AMRO Clearing held a 25% ownership interest. For both ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands, in addition to the non-controlling interest reported in the consolidated statements of income, we reported redeemable non-controlling interest in the consolidated balance sheets which represents the minority interest redemption fair value for each company.During June 2017, we purchased both Gasunie’s 21% minority ownership interest in ICE Endex and ABN AMRO Clearing’s 25% minority ownership interest in ICE Clear Netherlands. Subsequent to these acquisitions, we own 100% of ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands and will no longer include any non-controlling interest amounts for ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands in our consolidated financial statements. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we purchased 12.6% of the net profit sharing interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries from several non-ICE limited partners and the remaining non-ICE limited partners hold a 29.9% net profit sharing interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. Consolidated Income Tax Provision Consolidated income tax expense (benefit) was $(25) million, $580 million and $358 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change in consolidated income tax expense (benefit) between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate each year. Our effective tax rate was (1)%, 29% and 22% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable U.S. and U.K. tax law changes and favorable foreign income tax rate differentials, partially offset by state income taxes. Favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower income tax rates in the U.K. and various other lower tax jurisdictions as compared to the historical income tax rates in the U.S. During the fourth quarter of 2015, the U.K. reduced their corporate income tax rate from 20% to 19% effective April 1, 2017 and to 18% effective April 1, 2020. During the third quarter of 2016, the U.K. further reduced their corporate income tax rate from 18% to 17% effective April 1, 2020. During December 2017, the TCJA reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. See “- Recent Developments” above. The reduction in U.S. and U.K. corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits in the respective periods of enactment. The impact of the deferred tax benefits for the U.S. and U.K. corporate income tax rate reductions for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 lowered the effective tax rates by 30%, 2% and 4%, respectively, and resulted in deferred tax benefits of $764 million, $34 million and $60 million, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with the future U.S. income tax rate reduction and tax benefits associated with a divestiture in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the deferred tax benefit from the U.K. corporate income tax reduction in the third quarter of 2016, additional tax expense from an Illinois corporate income tax rate increase enacted in the third quarter of 2017, and an income tax expense increase due to a relatively higher U.S. mix of income in 2017. The increase in the effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to the tax impact of foreign versus U.S. based pre-tax income, lower deferred tax benefits associated with the future U.K. income tax rate reductions, and greater favorable settlements with 59various taxing authorities in 2015, partially offset by a tax benefit from the early adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2016. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere is this Annual Report, for additional information on these tax items.Quarterly Results of Operations The following quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of income data has been prepared on substantially the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations for the quarters presented. The historical results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for any future period. This unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly data should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The following table sets forth quarterly consolidated statements of income data (in millions): Three Months Ended, December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 September 30, 2016 June 30, 2016 March 31, 2016Revenues: Energy futures and options contracts$227 $223 $231 $228 $224 $199 $212 $230Agricultural and metals futures and options contracts49 49 62 56 47 52 67 62Interest rates and other financial futures and options contracts72 82 89 83 74 70 80 94Cash equities and equity options365 355 390 381 426 410 454 490Other transactions45 49 45 50 47 46 47 53Total transaction and clearing, net758 758 817 798 818 777 860 929Pricing and analytics248 242 242 238 234 209 211 204Exchange data140 136 142 138 132 136 139 128Desktops and connectivity137 140 137 144 149 144 147 145Total data services525 518 521 520 515 489 497 477Listings102 102 107 106 105 106 105 103Other revenues54 54 49 45 46 44 42 45Total revenues1,439 1,432 1,494 1,469 1,484 1,416 1,504 1,554Transaction-based expenses295 289 316 305 346 338 375 400Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses1,144 1,143 1,178 1,164 1,138 1,078 1,129 1,154Compensation and benefits227 231 234 245 237 236 236 236Professional services27 30 32 32 36 32 37 32Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs9 4 9 14 19 14 20 27Technology and communication103 99 97 98 97 93 92 92Rent and occupancy17 17 17 18 18 17 17 18Selling, general and administrative38 38 38 41 33 31 30 22Depreciation and amortization (1)131 128 142 134 140 181 146 143Total operating expenses552 547 569 582 580 604 578 570Operating income592 596 609 582 558 474 551 584Other income (expense), net (2)77 (36) (44) 141 (28) (31) (35) (44)Income tax expense (benefit) (3)(562) 185 139 213 171 93 153 163Net income$1,231 $375 $426 $510 $359 $350 $363 $377Net income attributable to non-controlling interest(6) (6) (8) (8) (7) (6) (6) (8)Net income attributable to ICE$1,225 $369 $418 $502 $352 $344 $357 $369(1) The increase in the depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to the $33 million Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment. See “- Consolidated Operating Expenses” above.(2) Other income (expense), net for the three months ended December 31, 2017 includes a $110 million gain on our sale of Trayport, and for the three months ended March 31, 2017, includes a $176 million realized investment gain in connection with the sale of our investment in Cetip. See “- Recent Developments” above.(3) The decrease in the income tax expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to a $764 million deferred tax benefit associated with future U.S. income tax reductions, the decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily due to the tax benefit associated with a divestiture, and the decrease for the three months ended September 30, 2016 is primarily due to a deferred tax benefit associated with future U.K. income tax rate reductions. See “- Consolidated Income Tax Provision” above.60Liquidity and Capital Resources Below are charts that reflect our capital allocation. The acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes both the net cash paid for the acquisitions and the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs in each year.We have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends to our shareholders and the continued development of our technology platforms that support our businesses. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt as it matures. In the future, we may need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities, which we may be unable to do or to do on favorable terms. See “- Future Capital Requirements” below. Our Commercial Paper Program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. We reduced our outstanding commercial paper during the year ended December 31, 2017 by $409 million, primarily using net cash proceeds received from the sale of our investment in Cetip, the sale of Trayport and cash flows from operations, partially offset by acquisitions and investments we made in 2017. See “- Debt” below.See “- Recent Developments” above for a discussion of the acquisitions and investments that we made during the year ended December 31, 2017. These cash acquisitions and investments were funded from borrowing under our Commercial Paper Program, cash flows from operations and a portion of the proceeds received from our divestitures during the year ended December 31, 2017. Upon maturity of old issuances of commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. To mitigate the rollover risk, we maintain an undrawn back-stop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our Commercial Paper Program. If we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the back-stop revolving facility, however electing to do so would result in higher interest expense. See “- Debt” below.Consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $535 million and $407 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We had $1.0 billion and $943 million in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively and $432 million in long-term investments as of December 31, 2016 (relating to our investment in Cetip, which was sold in 2017). We consider all short-term, highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. Cash and investments that are 61not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and investments. As of December 31, 2017, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was $325 million. While we consider our non-U.S. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested overseas, if these cash balances are needed for our operations in the U.S., any repatriation by way of dividend may be subject to both U.S. federal and state income taxes, as adjusted for any non-U.S. tax credits. Such dividends may not be subject to U.S. federal tax under the TCJA and we will continue to monitor both federal and state interpretations, guidance and regulations concerning U.S. tax reform. However, we do not have any current needs or foreseeable future needs or other plans to repatriate cash by way of dividends from our non-U.S. subsidiaries. We will continue to evaluate our indefinite reinvestment assertion in light of any further U.S. tax reform developments.Our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. We may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.Certain of these investments, with an original maturity of greater than three months, will be classified as available-for-sale in accordance with relevant accounting standards. Available-for-sale investments are carried at their fair values with unrealized gains and losses, reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Realized gains and losses, and declines in value deemed to be other-than-temporary on available-for-sale investments, are recognized currently in earnings. We do not have any investments classified as held-to-maturity or trading. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 14,966,616 shares, 902,920 shares and 14,343,845 shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $949 million, $50 million and $660 million, respectively. The shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. These repurchases were completed on the open market and under our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan. In connection with our acquisition of Interactive Data during the fourth quarter of 2015, we suspended our stock repurchase plan for a period of time. The timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. Our management periodically reviews whether or not to be active in repurchasing our stock. In making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, we consider multiple factors. The factors may include: overall stock market conditions, our common stock price movements, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our board of directors, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.In August 2016, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date. In September 2017, our board of directors approved an aggregate of $1.2 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that becomes effective as of January 1, 2018. We expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our debt facilities or our Commercial Paper Program. Repurchases may be made from time to time on the open market, through established trading plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. We have entered into a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, as authorized by our board of directors, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. We may discontinue the stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate the Rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time. The approval of our board of directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. In addition, our board of directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time.Cash Flow The following presents the major components of net increases (decreases) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions):62 Year Ended December 31,2017 2016 2015Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$2,085 $2,149 $1,311Investing activities92 (860) (3,004)Financing activities(1,971) (1,462) 1,976Effect of exchange rate changes 12 (24) (14)Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents$218 $(197) $269The FASB has issued ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash, that requires entities to show the changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. As a result, entities will no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in the statement of cash flows. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we adopted ASU 2016-18 and reclassified changes in restricted cash from cash flow provided by (used in) investing activities to the total change in beginning-of-year and end-of-year total amounts shown on the consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. This new standard is a change in cash flow statement presentation only. Refer to note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the impact of the adoption of ASU 2016-18.Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital. Fluctuations in net cash provided by operating activities are primarily attributable to increases and decreases in our net income between periods and due to fluctuations in working capital. The $64 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016, is primarily due to a $136 million contribution that was made to our pension plan in September 2017, compared to a $10 million contribution that was made to our pension plan in September 2016. The pension contribution in September 2017 allowed us to reach 99% funding of our pension obligation and allowed us to immunize the liability against future market fluctuations. For additional information on our pension plan, refer to note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report.The $838 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016, from the comparable period in 2015, is primarily due to $393 million in cash provided by operating activities for Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis for the year ended December 31, 2016, increase in the net income of our historical income statement excluding the acquisitions, and other fluctuations in working capital (including the impact of the increase in cash paid for income taxes in 2015). Investing Activities Consolidated net cash provided by (used in) investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 primarily relates to cash paid for acquisitions, cash received from divestitures, net cash received from the sale of our investment in Cetip, purchases of cost and equity method investments, proceeds from term deposits, and changes in the capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. We paid cash for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, of $423 million, $425 million and $3.8 billion, respectively, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, primarily relating to the NGX, Shorcan Energy, BofAML indices and TMX Atrium acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2017, the Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions during the year ended December 31, 2016, and the Interactive Data acquisition during the year ended December 31, 2015. We received cash from our divestitures of $761 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, relating to the sales of Trayport, IDMS and NYSE Governance Services. We received net cash proceeds from the sale of our investment in Cetip of $438 million. We made purchases of cost and equity method investments of $327 million, $70 million and $60 million during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, relating to our investments in Euroclear, MERS and OCC. See “- Recent Developments” above for more details on these acquisitions, divestitures and investments. We received proceeds from term deposits of $1.1 billion during the year ended December 31, 2015 relating to the repayments of outstanding debt. Capital expenditures were $220 million, $250 million and $190 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $137 million, $115 million and $87 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements associated 63with the new and renovated office spaces in Atlanta, New York and London. The software development expenditures primarily relate to the continued development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms, data services and clearing houses.Financing Activities Consolidated net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily relates to $984 million in net proceeds from the 2022 Senior Notes and 2027 Senior Notes offerings, $850 million in repayments of the NYSE Notes, $409 million in net repayments under our Commercial Paper Program, $949 million in repurchases of common stock, $476 million in dividend payments to our shareholders, $174 million in acquisitions of non-controlling interest and redeemable non-controlling interest and $88 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises. See “- Recent Developments” above and “- Debt” below.Consolidated net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 primarily relates to $949 million in net repayments under our Commercial Paper Program, $409 million in dividend payments to our shareholders, $54 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises and $50 million in repurchases of common stock. Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 primarily relates to $2.5 billion in net proceeds received in connection with the offering of new senior notes and $1.7 billion in net borrowings under our commercial paper program, partially offset by $1.0 billion in net repayments under our debt facilities, $660 million in repurchases of common stock, $331 million in dividend payments to our shareholders, $128 million for the purchase of subsidiary shares from non-controlling interest holders and $45 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises.Debt Our total debt, including short-term and long-term debt, consisted of the following as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions): As of December 31, 2017 2016Debt: Short-term debt: Commercial Paper$1,233 $1,6422018 Senior Notes (2.50% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2018) 600 —NYSE Notes (2.00% senior unsecured notes due October 5, 2017)— 851Total short-term debt 1,833 2,493Long-term debt: 2018 Senior Notes (2.50% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2018) — 5982020 Senior Notes (2.75% senior unsecured notes due December 1, 2020)1,244 1,2422022 Senior Notes (2.35% senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2022)495 —2023 Senior Notes (4.00% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2023) 791 7902025 Senior Notes (3.75% senior unsecured notes due December 1, 2025)1,242 1,2412027 Senior Notes (3.10% senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2027)495 —Total long-term debt4,267 3,871Total debt$6,100 $6,364Amended Credit FacilityWe had previously entered into a $3.4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, with a maturity date of November 13, 2020, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., or Wells Fargo, as administrative agent, issuing lender and swing-line lender, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. On August 18, 2017, we agreed with the lenders to, amongst other items, extend the maturity date to August 18, 2022, herein referred to as the Amended Credit Facility. The Amended Credit Facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available for borrowing by up to $975 million, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions. 64Other amendments within the Amended Credit Facility include, but are not limited to, (i) eliminating the step-up in the commitment fee ratings-based grid that was scheduled to take effect in April 2019, (ii) removing ICE Europe Parent Limited as a party to the credit agreement, (iii) removing the guaranty by ICE in respect of ICE Europe Parent Limited, (iv) increasing the maximum leverage ratio to 3.50:1.00, and (v) up to two times, increasing the maximum leverage ratio from 3.50:1.00 to 4.00:1.00 for a period of one year following a material acquisition. No amounts were outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017. Amounts borrowed under the Amended Credit Facility may be prepaid at any time without premium or penalty. The Amended Credit Facility provides for a $3.4 billion multi-currency revolving facility, with sub-limits for non-dollar borrowings and letters of credit and with a swing-line facility available on a same-day basis. Of the $3.4 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the Amended Credit Facility, $1.2 billion is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2017 and $100 million is required to support certain subsidiary clearing house commitments. The amount required to back-stop the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining $2.1 billion available under the Amended Credit Facility as of December 31, 2017 is available to us to use for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Facility will bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate or (b) a “base rate” plus an applicable margin rate; provided, however, that all loans denominated in a foreign currency will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin rate. The “base rate” equals the higher of (i) Wells Fargo’s prime rate, (ii) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, or (iii) the one-month LIBOR rate plus 1.00%. The applicable margin rate is based upon our public long-term debt ratings and ranges from 0.875% to 1.50% on LIBOR borrowings and from 0.00% to 0.50% on base rate borrowings.The Amended Credit Facility includes an unutilized revolving credit commitment fee that is equal to the unused maximum revolver amount, multiplied by an applicable commitment fee rate and is payable in arrears on a quarterly basis. The applicable commitment fee rate ranges from 0.08% to 0.20% and is determined based on our long-term debt rating. As of December 31, 2017, the applicable commitment fee rate was 0.125% based on our current long-term debt ratings. Senior NotesOn August 17, 2017, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate senior notes, including $500 million principal amount of 2.35% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due September 2022, or the 2022 Senior Notes, and $500 million principal amount of 3.10% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due September 2027, or the 2027 Senior Notes. We used the majority of the net proceeds from the 2022 Senior Notes and 2027 Senior Notes offering to fund the redemption of the NYSE Notes. In November 2015, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate senior notes, including $1.25 billion principal amount of 2.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due November 2020, or the 2020 Senior Notes, and $1.25 billion principal amount of 3.75% senior unsecured fixed rate notes due November 2025, or the 2025 Senior Notes. We used the net proceeds from the 2020 Senior Notes and 2025 Senior Notes offering, together with $1.6 billion of borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program, to finance the $4.1 billion cash portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of Interactive Data. Commercial Paper ProgramWe have entered into our Commercial Paper Program, which is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the Amended Credit Facility, equal to the amount of the commercial paper that is issued and outstanding at any given point in time. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short-term interest rates (such as USD LIBOR). The fluctuation of these rates due to market conditions may impact our interest expense.We repaid $409 million of net notes outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2017 primarily using net cash proceeds received from the sale of our investment in Cetip and the sale of Trayport. These repayments were partially offset by notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2017 for the cash acquisitions and investments and to repurchase our common stock. We used net proceeds from notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2016 to finance part of the cash purchase price of the Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. We used net proceeds from notes issued under the Commercial Paper Program during the year ended December 31, 2015 to finance part of the cash portion of the purchase price of the Interactive Data acquisition and to pay related fees and expenses, to repurchase our common stock, and for general corporate purposes. We repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 with cash flows from operations. Commercial paper notes of $1.2 billion with original maturities ranging from two to 64 days were outstanding as of December 31, 2017 under our Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.2 billion outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program was 1.49% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 18 days. 65Commercial paper notes of $1.6 billion with original maturities ranging from three to 68 days were outstanding as of December 31, 2016 under the Commercial Paper Program. As of December 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on the $1.6 billion outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program was 0.74% per annum, with a weighted average maturity of 18 days. NYSE NotesThe $850 million, 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate NYSE Notes were due in October 2017. We redeemed the NYSE Notes in full in September 2017 using the majority of the proceeds from the 2022 Senior Notes and 2027 Senior Notes offering. Refer to note 10 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for additional information on our debt and debt facilities. Future Capital Requirements Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our Trading and Clearing and Data and Listings segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business, potential stock repurchases, and the continuing market acceptance of our electronic trading and clearing platforms. We currently expect to make aggregate capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur capitalized software development costs ranging between $300 million and $330 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses. Our board of directors has adopted a quarterly dividend declaration policy providing that the declaration of any dividends will be determined quarterly by the board of directors or the audit committee of the board of directors taking into account such factors as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined annual net income payout ratio. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we paid cash dividends of $0.80 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including 2017 quarterly dividends of $0.20 per share, for an aggregate payout of $476 million in 2017, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. Refer to note 11 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years. For the first quarter of 2018, we announced a $0.24 per share dividend, which is a 20% increase over the prior dividend, which is payable on March 29, 2018 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2018.As of December 31, 2017, we had $6.1 billion in outstanding debt. We currently have a $3.4 billion Amended Credit Facility. After factoring in the $1.2 billion required to back-stop the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2017 and $100 million that is required to support certain subsidiary clearing house commitments, $2.1 billion of our Amended Credit Facility is currently available for general corporate purposes. The Amended Credit Facility and our Commercial Paper Program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have with third parties for liquidity and capital resources. In the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. However, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. See “- Debt” above.Non-GAAP Financial Measures We use non-GAAP measures internally to evaluate our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. When viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe that our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparison of results because the items described below as adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We strongly recommend that investors review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto.Adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ICE common shareholders and adjusted earnings per share for the periods presented below are calculated by adding or subtracting the adjustments described below, which are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance, and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts):66 Trading and Clearing Segment Data and Listings Segment Consolidated Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015 2017 2016 2015Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses$2,128 $2,102 $2,062 $2,501 $2,397 $1,276 $4,629 $4,499 $3,338Operating expenses779 825 915 1,471 1,507 673 2,250 2,332 1,588Less: Interactive Data and NYSE transaction and integration costs and acquisition-related success fees — 1 24 31 45 59 31 46 83Less: Impairment on divestiture of NYSE Governance Services— — — 6 — — 6 — —Less: Accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries14 — — — — — 14 — —Less: Employee severance costs related to Creditex U.K. brokerage operations— 4 — — — — — 4 —Less: Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment— 33 — — — — — 33 —Less: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles53 72 82 208 230 58 261 302 140Adjusted operating expenses$712 $715 $809 $1,226 $1,232 $556 $1,938 $1,947 $1,365Operating income$1,349 $1,277 $1,147 $1,030 $890 $603 $2,379 $2,167 $1,750Adjusted operating income$1,416 $1,387 $1,253 $1,275 $1,165 $720 $2,691 $2,552 $1,973Operating margin63% 61% 56% 41% 37% 47% 51% 48% 52%Adjusted operating margin67% 66% 61% 51% 49% 56% 58% 57% 59% Net income attributable to ICE $2,514 $1,422 $1,274Add: Interactive Data and NYSE transaction and integration costs and acquisition-related success fees 31 46 83Add: Impairment on divestiture of NYSE Governance Services 6 — —Add: Accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries 14 — —Add: Employee severance costs related to Creditex U.K. brokerage operations — 4 —Add: Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment — 33 —Add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 261 302 140Add: Litigation settlements and accruals, net — — 15Add: Pre-acquisition interest expense on debt issued for Interactive Data acquisition — — 5Less: Gain on divestiture of Trayport, net (110) — —Less: Cetip investment gain, net (167) — —Less: Income tax effect related to the items above (43) (143) (83)Less: Tax adjustments on U.S. tax reform (764) — —Add/(Less): Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles 10 (22) (82)Add: Other tax adjustments — 23 7Adjusted net income attributable to ICE $1,752 $1,665 $1,359 Basic earnings per share $4.27 $2.39 $2.29Diluted earnings per share $4.23 $2.37 $2.28 Adjusted basic earnings per share $2.97 $2.80 $2.44Adjusted diluted earnings per share $2.95 $2.78 $2.43 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 589 595 556Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 594 599 559Acquisition-related transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. However, the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to Interactive Data and NYSE are included in non-GAAP adjustments given the sizes of these acquisitions. As of June 30, 2016, the integration of NYSE has been completed and we will no longer include any NYSE integration costs as non-GAAP 67adjustments following this date. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-GAAP adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results.During the year ended December 31, 2017, we include as non-GAAP adjustments the Cetip realized investment gain and the foreign exchange loss and transaction expenses on the sale of our investment in Cetip, as the sale of our investment in Cetip is not part of our core business operations. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we include as non-GAAP adjustments the net gain on the divestiture of Trayport, the accruals relating to ongoing investigations and inquiries, and the NYSE Governance Services net loss on its divestiture, as they are non-recurring items. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we include as non-GAAP adjustments the Creditex U.K. voice brokerage severance costs related to its discontinuance and the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense, as they are non-recurring items. During the year ended December 31, 2015, we include as non-GAAP adjustments various litigation settlements and accruals and the interest expense on the senior notes and commercial paper we issued for the Interactive Data acquisition (from the issuance date of the new senior notes on November 24, 2015 and on the issuance dates of the commercial paper in early December 2015 to the acquisition date of Interactive Data on December 14, 2015), as they are not part of our core business operations or represent non-recurring items. The income tax effects relating to the items above are included in non-GAAP adjustments as well as deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles and other tax adjustments. The tax items in non-GAAP adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments or are tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance. The income tax effects of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2017 include tax benefits associated with the divestiture of NYSE Governance Services. The tax adjustments on U.S. tax reform mainly include the $764 million deferred tax benefit as a result of the enactment of TCJA in the last quarter of 2017, which reduces the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include the impact of U.S. state tax law and apportionment changes which resulted in deferred tax expense of $10 million, deferred tax expense of $12 million, and deferred tax benefits of $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. In addition, deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include $34 million and $60 million deferred tax benefits due to U.K. corporate income tax rate reductions for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Other tax adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2016 relate to a $15 million valuation allowance on Singapore pre-acquisition net operating losses and other deferred tax assets and an $8 million deferred tax adjustment with respect to our OCC equity method investment. Other tax adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2015 represents a $7 million uncertain tax position relating to a retrospective foreign tax law change for a pre-acquisition period. For additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report and “- Recent Developments,” “- Consolidated Operating Expenses”, “- Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” and “- Consolidated Income Tax Provision” above.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Except for certain clearing house collateral that is reported off-balance sheet, we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. Refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on our clearing houses’ collateral.Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table presents, for the periods indicated, our contractual obligations (which we intend to fund from our existing cash as well as cash flow from operations) and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 YearsContractual Obligations: Short-term and long-term debt and interest $7,036 $1,993 $1,637 $1,500 $1,906Operating lease obligations 521 78 218 63 162Purchase obligations188 101 76 11 —Total contractual cash obligations $7,745 $2,172 $1,931 $1,574 $2,068Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum 68quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.We have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above $51.2 billion in cash margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable. Clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. The cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. NGX administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. It has an equal and offsetting claim to and from their respective participants on opposite sides of the physically settled contract. This balance is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable. We have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or UTBs, from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments table above. As of December 31, 2017, our cumulative UTBs were $115 million. Interest and penalties related to UTBs were $35 million as of December 31, 2017. We are under examination by various tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. It is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. See note 12 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our UTBs. As of December 31, 2017, in connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs. We have a 40% ownership in OCC. Under the OCC’s capital plan, the OCC shareholders have committed to contribute up to $200 million in equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by NYSE, which has also been excluded from the table above. New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis, including those related to the accounting matters described below. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments. Based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. The values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets 69We have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired, including other identified intangible assets. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles when a specific right or contract is acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets are impaired requires us to make significant judgments and requires us to use significant estimates and assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. As of December 31, 2017, we had goodwill of $12.2 billion and net other intangible assets of $10.3 billion relating to our acquisitions and our purchase of trademarks and Internet domain names from various third parties. We do not amortize goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. In performing the purchase price allocation, we consider, among other factors, the intended future use of acquired assets, analysis of historical financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. At the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation. We continue to review and validate estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies underlying the preliminary valuation during the measurement period. Accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The measurement period ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill of the reporting unit or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We have identified four reporting units: our Futures reporting unit, our Data and Listings reporting unit, our Cash Equities reporting unit, and our CDS reporting unit. Goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. The initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. However, if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. For annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. Otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. For annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount. Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. These estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. Future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Our impairment analysis has not resulted in any impairment of goodwill through December 31, 2017. We are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. If an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. Fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis. 70In August 2016, we sold certain of Creditex’s U.S. voice brokerage operations to Tullett Prebon. During the third quarter of 2016, we discontinued Creditex’s U.K. voice brokerage operations. We continue to operate Creditex’s electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property. After the sale and the discontinuance of the voice brokerage operations, it was determined that the carrying value of the CDS Creditex customer relationship intangible asset was not fully recoverable and an impairment of the asset was recorded in September 2016 for $33 million. The impairment was recorded as amortization expense in the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2016. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., U.K. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires significant judgment, the use of estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, or SAB 118, has provided guidance for companies that have not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. As of December 31, 2017, we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the TCJA, however, we have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our deferred tax balances and in relation to the transition tax. In other cases, we have not been able to make a reasonable estimate and will continue to analyze the TCJA in order to finalize any related impacts within the measurement period. The FASB Staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income, or GILTI, noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. We have not completed our analysis of the effects of the GILTI provisions and will further consider the accounting policy election within the measurement period as provided for under SAB 118.We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.We operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. ITEM 7 (A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, short-term and long-term restricted cash and investments, and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents were $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, of which $293 million and $272 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or Canadian 71dollars. The remaining cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. A hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $8 million as of December 31, 2017, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2017, we had $6.1 billion in outstanding debt, of which $4.9 billion relates to our senior notes, which bear interest at fixed interest rates. The remaining amount outstanding of $1.2 billion relates to the Commercial Paper Program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2017 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $12 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. See Item 7 “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Debt” included elsewhere in this Annual Report. The interest rates on our Commercial Paper Program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. The weighted average interest rate on our Commercial Paper Program increased from 0.74% as of December 31, 2016 to 1.49% as of December 31, 2017. The increase in the Commercial Paper Program weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve in March 2017, in June 2017 and in December 2017 to increase the federal funds short-term interest rate by an aggregate 75 basis points to 1.50%. The Federal Reserve also signaled that they intend to continue to increase the federal fund short-term interest rate over the next several years, and if this occurs, this will continue to increase the weighted average interest rate on our Commercial Paper Program. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk As an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. Certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. Our exposure to foreign denominated earnings for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates): Year Ended December 31, 2017 Year Ended December 31, 2016 Pound Sterling Euro Pound Sterling EuroAverage exchange rate to the U.S. dollar $1.2890 $1.1297 $1.3603 $1.1075Average exchange rate to the U.S. dollar for the prior year$1.3603 $1.1075 $1.5292 $1.1117Average exchange rate change from prior year(5)% 2% (11)% —%Foreign denominated percentage of: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses10 % 4% 10 % 5%Operating expenses12 % 3% 14 % 4%Operating income9 % 6% 7 % 7%Impact of the currency fluctuations (1) on: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses$(26) $4 $(58) $(1)Operating expenses$(14) $1 $(40) $—Operating income$(12) $3 $(18) $(1)(1)Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.We have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, 15%, 15% and 15%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 14%, 18%, and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. We have foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We had foreign currency transaction losses of $4 million, $1 million and $14 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The foreign currency transactions losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. A 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2017 would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $3 million, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity.72We entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. Although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities. We have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. Our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): As of December 31, 2017 Position in pounds sterling Position in Canadian dollars Position in eurosAssets£829 C$1,654 €145 of which goodwill represents268 162 43Liabilities96 1,026 42Net currency position£733 C$628 €103Impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates$99 $50 $12As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $136 million and $345 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had net exposure of pounds sterling, Canadian dollars and euros of £733 million ($990 million), C$628 million ($500 million), and €103 million ($124 million), respectively. Based on these December 31, 2017 net currency positions, a hypothetical 10% decrease of pound sterling against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $99 million, a hypothetical 10% decrease of Canadian dollar against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $50 million, and a hypothetical 10% decrease of euro against U.S. dollar would negatively impact our equity by $12 million. For the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, currency exchange rate differences had a positive/(negative) impact of $209 million, ($300 million) and ($58 million), respectively, on our consolidated equity. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to the increase in the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate to 1.3510 as of December 31, 2017 (from 1.2336 as of December 31, 2016) due to the strengthening pound sterling. The decrease for the year ended December 31, 2016 is primarily due to the decrease in the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate to 1.2336 as of December 31, 2016 (from 1.4868 as of December 31, 2015) due to the weakening pound sterling. The pound sterling decreased starting in June 2016 following the U.K. referendum that resulted in a vote for the U.K. to leave the EU. The future impact on our business relating to the U.K. leaving the EU and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.Credit Risk We are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments and execute agreements. Clearing House Cash Deposit RisksOur clearing houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. Refer to note 13 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information about clearing house cash deposits and delivery contracts, which were $51.2 billion as of December 31, 2017. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the clearing houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.Credit RiskWhen a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits reflecting a number of factors including ratings assigned by rating agencies, CDS spreads and internal ratings, as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. We seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by ensuring financial assets are placed with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.73An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) to avoid a concentration of risk.Liquidity RiskLiquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. To mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.Interest Rate RiskInterest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price. Our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments of cash deposits. For example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. In addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, U.S. Treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (Euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities. Security Issuer RiskSecurity issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments. Investment Counterparty RiskInvestment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral under the repurchase agreement to high quality issuers. When engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the underlying reverse repurchase securities in custody accounts under clearing house control. Additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. The typical haircut received for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the reverse repurchase counterparty’s obligation to the clearing house.Our clearing houses may use third party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided to them by the clearing house. Such investment advisors do not hold clearing member cash deposits or the underlying investments. Clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control. Clearing house property is held with credit worthy custodians including JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., Citibank N.A., BNY Mellon, BMO Harris N.A. and Euroclear Bank Brussels (for non-U.S. dollar deposits). Each clearing house employs (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single investment advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional investment advisors or custodians are available as alternatives. Cross-Currency Margin Deposit RiskEach of our clearing houses, pursuant to their rules, may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in U.S. dollars to secure a Euro margin obligation). The clearing houses mitigate the risk of a decline in currency value by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of high currency volatility. Cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.Impact of Inflation We have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. In the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.74",2023-12-30 20:40:43.914141
1571949,ICE,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.",2019,"ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons. See the factors set forth under the heading “Forward Looking Statements” at the beginning of Part 1 of this Annual Report and in Item 1(A) under the heading “Risk Factors.” The following discussion is qualified in its entirety by, and should be read in conjunction with, the more detailed information contained in Item 6 “Selected Financial Data” and our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Overview We are a leading global operator of regulated exchanges, clearing houses and listings venues, and a provider of data services for commodity, financial, fixed income and equity markets. We operate regulated marketplaces for listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and securities across major asset classes, including energy and agricultural commodities, metals, interest rates, equities, ETFs, credit derivatives, bonds and currencies. We also offer comprehensive data services to support the trading, investment, risk management and connectivity needs of customers around the world and across asset classes.Our exchanges include derivative exchanges in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada and Singapore, and cash equities, equity options and bond exchanges in the U.S. We also operate OTC markets for physical energy, fixed income and CDS trade execution. To serve global derivatives markets, we operate central counterparty, or CCP, clearing houses in the U.S., U.K., EU, Canada and Singapore. We offer a range of data services for global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, desktops and connectivity solutions. Through our markets, clearing houses, listings and data services, we provide comprehensive solutions for our customers through liquid markets, benchmark products, access to capital markets and related services to support their ability to manage risk and raise capital. Our business is currently conducted as two reportable business segments, our Trading and Clearing segment and our Data and Listings segment, and the majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S., U.K. and Canada. Recent Developments U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJAIn December 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. It reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. Many of the tax provisions under the TCJA became effective January 1, 2018, including the new rate and complex international tax provisions. Given the complexity of these international provisions and certain potential unintended consequences that are under debate at both the federal and state level, certain federal and state guidance has been issued and further guidance is anticipated, but the likelihood and timing of such guidance remains uncertain. See “- Consolidated Income Tax Provision” below. AcquisitionsOn January 2, 2018, we acquired BondPoint from Virtu Financial, Inc. for $400 million in cash. BondPoint is a provider of electronic fixed income trading solutions for the buy-side and sell-side, offering access to centralized liquidity and automated trade execution services through its ATS and provides trading services to more than 500 financial services firms. On July 18, 2018, we acquired CHX Holdings, Inc., the parent company of CHX, a full-service stock exchange, including trading, data and corporate listings services. CHX operates as a registered national securities exchange.On July 23, 2018, we acquired TMC Bonds for $700 million in cash. The cash consideration is gross of $15 million cash held by TMC Bonds on the date of acquisition. TMC Bonds is an electronic fixed income marketplace, supporting anonymous trading across multiple protocols in various asset classes, including municipals, corporates, treasuries, agencies and certificates of deposit. On October 3, 2018, we completed the purchase of the remaining equity interests in MERS and accordingly now have 100% ownership. On that date, we gained control of MERS, now part of ICE Mortgage Services, began to include its results as 41part of our consolidated operations, and recorded a $110 million gain on our initial investment value as other non-operating income. Launch of BakktOn December 19, 2018, we and non-ICE limited partners funded the newly-formed entity, Bakkt, LLC, or Bakkt. Bakkt was formed to create an integrated platform that enables consumers and institutions to transact in digital assets. The Bakkt ecosystem is designed to include regulated trading, clearing and custodial solutions for digital assets, which will be supported by ICE Futures U.S. and ICE Clear U.S. The first traded contract targeted for launch will be a Bakkt Bitcoin physically delivered daily futures contract to provide price discovery. The custodial solution will establish new protocols for managing the specific security and settlement requirements of digital currencies. In addition, there will be a separate guaranty fund. It is also expected that Bakkt will offer additional solutions to expand the range of uses for digital assets. Investment in EuroclearDuring 2017, we purchased a 4.7% stake in Euroclear valued at €276 million in cash ($327 million). Upon purchasing this stake, we agreed to participate on the Euroclear Board of Directors. During the same period, we negotiated an additional purchase which closed on February 21, 2018, following regulatory approval. This provided us with an additional 5.1% stake in Euroclear for a purchase price of €246 million in cash ($304 million). As of December 31, 2018, we own a 9.8% stake in Euroclear for a total investment of $631 million. Euroclear is a provider of post-trade services, including settlement, central securities depositories and related services for cross-border transactions across asset classes. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information.Purchase of Non-Controlling InterestsFor consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100% and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2017, non-controlling interest consisted of the operating results of our CDS clearing subsidiaries in which non-ICE limited partners held a 29.9% ownership interest. During September 2018, we purchased a 3.2% ownership interest from a non-ICE limited partner and the remaining other limited partners hold a 26.7% ownership interest as of December 31, 2018.42Consolidated Financial HighlightsThe following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Change 2017 2016 ChangeRevenues, less transaction-based expenses $4,979 $4,638 7 % $4,638 $4,512 3 %Operating expenses $2,396 $2,259 6 % $2,259 $2,340 (3)%Adjusted operating expenses(1)$2,071 $1,947 6 % $1,947 $1,955 — %Operating income $2,583 $2,379 9 % $2,379 $2,172 10 %Adjusted operating income(1)$2,908 $2,691 8 % $2,691 $2,557 5 %Operating margin 52 % 51 % 1 pt 51 % 48 % 3 ptsAdjusted operating margin(1)58 % 58 % — 58 % 57 % 1 ptOther income (expense), net $(63) 147 n/a 147 (129) n/aIncome tax expense (benefit)$500 $(28) n/a $(28) $586 n/aEffective tax rate 20% (1)% 21 pts (1)% 29% (30 pts)Net income attributable to ICE$1,988 $2,526 (21)% $2,526 $1,430 77 %Adjusted net income attributable to ICE(1)$2,077 $1,764 18 % $1,764 1,673 5 %Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$3.43 $4.25 (19)% $4.25 $2.39 78 %Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders(1)$3.59 $2.97 21 % $2.97 $2.79 6 %Cash flows from operating activities$2,533 $2,085 21 % $2,085 $2,149 (3)%(1) The adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance. Adjusted net income attributable to ICE and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders, are presented net of taxes. These adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with GAAP. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. 43•Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $341 million in 2018 from 2017. The increase in revenues includes $26 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 from 2017.•Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $126 million in 2017 from 2016. The increase in revenues includes $22 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar in 2017 from 2016. •Operating expenses increased $137 million in 2018 from 2017. The increase in operating expenses includes $11 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 from 2017. •Operating expenses decreased $81 million in 2017 from 2016. The decrease in operating expenses includes $13 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the strengthening U.S. dollar in 2017 from 2016. •In connection with our acquisition of MERS, we recorded a $110 million gain in other income during 2018. In connection with Cetip’s merger with BM&FBOVESPA S.A., now B3, we recognized a $167 million net realized investment gain in other income, net in 2017. We also recognized a net gain of $110 million in connection with our divestiture of Trayport in other income (expense), net in 2017.•Excluding the 2017 deferred tax benefit from the U.S. tax law changes, the 2018 effective tax rate is lower than the 2017 effective tax rate due to the TCJA, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, tax benefits from our acquisition of MERS, deferred tax benefits from the U.S. tax rate reduction resulting from changes in estimates and additional tax benefits associated with our sale of Trayport. •The 2017 effective tax rate is lower than the 2016 effective tax rate due to a $764 million deferred tax benefit associated with the enactment of the TCJA in 2017.Business Environment and Market TrendsOur business environment has been characterized by:•globalization of exchanges, customers and competitors; •lower interest rates and financial markets uncertainty;•rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; •evolving and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions;•increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies; and•consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.Price volatility increases the need to hedge risk and creates demand among market participants for the exchange of risk through trading and clearing. Market liquidity is one of the primary market attributes for attracting and maintaining customers and is an important indicator of a market’s strength. In addition, the ability to evolve existing products to serve emerging needs, develop new products and respond to competitive dynamics in pricing, exclusivity and consolidation is important to our business.Recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several of the MiFID II regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” included in this Annual Report, Brexit, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.In recent years, low interest rates and uncertainty in the financial markets continued to reflect the impact of a relatively slow economic recovery. Lower growth in Asia and the EU may also continue to affect global financial markets. In addition, economic and regulatory uncertainty, coupled with periods of high market volatility around geopolitical events, low interest rates and low natural gas prices, has affected our clients’ activities in recent years. The duration of these trends will determine the continued impact on our business. 44We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 39% in 2014 to 56% in 2018. This non-transaction revenue includes data services and listings.Many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: •increasing global regulatory demands; •greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; •greater emphasis on risk management; •market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; •the move to passive investing and indexation; •ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; •increased automation of fixed income and other less automated markets; •the development of new data products; •the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; •new entrants; and •increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, as well as on our company-wide expense reduction initiatives and our synergies in connection with our acquisitions in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing and markets.Segment Results Our business is conducted through two reportable business segments: •Trading and Clearing, which comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses; and•Data and Listings, which comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses. While revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments. We use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment. Further, we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments since such an allocation is not reasonably possible. Our two segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.45Trading and Clearing SegmentThe following presents selected statements of income data for our Trading and Clearing segment (dollars in millions):46(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

In our derivatives markets, we earn transaction and clearing revenues from both counterparties to each contract that is traded and/or cleared, and in our equity and equity options markets, we receive trade execution fees as well as routing fees related to orders in our markets which are routed to other markets for execution. Rates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and due to product mix. 47In 2018, 2017 and 2016, 20%, 20% and 19%, respectively, of our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro over the last two years compared to the U.S. dollar, our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were higher by $18 million in 2018 from 2017, and were lower by $14 million in 2017 from 2016.Our transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $844 million, $749 million and $674 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in the rebates is due primarily to an increase in the number of participants in the rebate programs offered on various contracts, an increase in our traded volume and an increase in the number of rebate programs. •Energy Futures and Options Contracts: Total energy volume and revenues increased 1% and 6%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and increased 8% and 5%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. Revenues increased in 2018 from 2017 due to a higher mix of gasoil, emissions and TTF gas volumes, which have a higher average RPC than other energy products.Total oil volume increased 3% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 14% in 2017 from 2016. ICE Brent crude futures and options volume was flat in 2018 from 2017, and increased 15% in 2017 from 2016. ICE WTI crude futures and options volume increased 5% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 14% in 2017 from 2016. The volume increases were primarily due to increased oil price volatility related to shifting supply and demand dynamics globally; broader market volatility in oil products, equities and foreign exchange rates; acts of central governments; outcomes of elections; and uncertainty around the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, policy. Our record gasoil futures and options volume in 2018 increased 11% from 2017, and increased 13% in 2017 from 2016. Gasoil futures and options increased during 2018 and 2017 primarily due to increased demand for distillates, strong economic activity in Europe and Asia and regulatory uncertainty. Our global natural gas futures and options volume decreased 4% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 1% in 2017 from 2016. The volume decrease in 2018 from 2017 was primarily due to lower U.S. price volatility reducing our commercial customers’ need to hedge the Henry Hub contract, and depressed gas prices driven by a continued surplus of natural gas during 2018 as compared to 2017. Our 2018 Henry Hub natural gas volume decrease was partially offset by increased volumes in our North American basis market and TTF gas in Europe. Our record TTF gas volumes in 2018 were driven by changing natural gas dynamics due to the continued globalization of natural gas. Emission futures and options volumes increased 73% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 1% in 2017 from 2016. Our record emissions volumes in 2018 were driven by higher carbon prices and supply-demand dynamics impacted by regulatory uncertainty.•Agricultural and Metals Futures and Options Contracts: Total volume and revenues in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets increased 15% and 16%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 7% and 5%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. Volume in our largest agricultural contract, sugar futures and options, increased 20% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 10% in 2017 from 2016. Other agricultural and metal futures and options volume increased 11% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 4% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in agricultural volumes to record levels in 2018 were primarily driven by price volatility resulting from shifting supply and demand dynamics. The decreases in agricultural volume in 2017 were primarily driven by the reduced price volatility in 2017 compared to the higher price volatility in 2016. •Financial Futures and Options Contracts: Interest rates futures and options volume and revenue increased 14% and 19%, respectively, in 2018 from 2017, and increased 27% and 9%, respectively, in 2017 from 2016. Our record level interest rate futures and options volume in 2018 was driven by expectations for heightened central bank activity during 2018, coupled with geopolitical uncertainty in the U.K. and Europe. Interest rates futures and options revenues were $230 million, $193 million and $177 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.Other financial futures and options volume decreased 9% in 2018 from 2017, and decreased 19% in 2017 from 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the termination of our exclusive license to list futures and options contracts on the Russell® indices. Excluding the futures and options contracts on the Russell® indices, other financial futures and options volume increased 18% in 2018 from 2017. Other financial futures and options revenues were $124 million, $133 million and $141 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.•Cash Equities and Equity Options: Cash equities handled volume increased 14% in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to higher total U.S. equity volumes driven by heightened volatility in the U.S. equity markets coupled with the May 482018 commencement of trading of NYSE National and the July 2018 acquisition of CHX. Cash equities handled volume decreased 17% in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to reduced U.S. equities market volatility during 2017 as compared to 2016. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $220 million, $196 million, and $223 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Equity options volume increased 43% in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to heightened volatility in the U.S. equity markets, as well as increased market share in 2018 due to greater volatility. Equity options volume decreased 13% in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to lower U.S. equity market volatility and the restructuring of the NYSE American Options business. Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $107 million, $90 million and $98 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. •Fixed Income and Credit: CDS clearing revenues were $139 million, $113 million and $107 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The notional value of CDS cleared was $16.4 trillion, $11.5 trillion and $11.5 trillion, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Buy-side participation at our U.S. CDS clearing house, ICE Clear Credit, reached record levels in terms of number of participants and notional cleared due to increased participation from both U.S. and European buy-side customers due to greater regulatory certainty, depth of liquidity, the breadth of products offered, and cost efficient margining in the U.S. relative to Europe. Fixed income and credit also includes revenues from ICE Bonds, which includes ICE BondPoint, TMC Bonds, ICE Credit Trade and ICE Mortgage Services.•OTC and Other Transactions: OTC and other transactions include revenues from our OTC energy business and other trade confirmation services.•Other Revenues: Other revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. The increase in other revenues in 2018 from 2017 is primarily due to increased interest income earned on certain clearing margin deposits, as well as a $5 million settlement received by NYSE Regulation from ING Financial Markets, LLC, or ING, following an investigation into improper conduct by ING's lending desk from 2007 to 2015. The 2018 increase was partially offset by a $6 million breakup fee received in August 2017 related to the termination of the derivatives clearing agreement with Euronext Group N.V.'s, or Euronext, under which ICE Clear Netherlands was to provide clearing of Euronext's financial and commodity derivatives.Selected Operating DataThe following charts and table present trading activity in our futures and options markets by commodity type based on the total number of contracts traded, as well as futures and options rate per contract (in millions, except for percentages and rate per contract amounts): Volume and Rate per Contract49 Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Change 2017 2016 ChangeNumber of contracts traded (in millions): Energy futures and options 692 685 1% 685 635 8 %Agricultural and metals futures and options 107 94 15 94 101 (7)Financial futures and options 710 647 10 647 564 15Total 1,509 1,426 6% 1,426 1,300 10 % Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Change 2017 2016 ChangeAverage Daily Volume of contracts traded (in millions): Energy futures and options 2,747 2,731 1% 2,731 2,521 8 %Agricultural and metals futures and options 427 374 14 374 399 (6)Financial futures and options 2,770 2,536 9 2,536 2,205 15Total 5,944 5,641 5% 5,641 5,125 10 % Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Rate per contract:2018 2017 Change 2017 2016 ChangeEnergy futures and options$1.39 $1.33 5% $1.33 $1.36 (2)%Agricultural and metals futures and options$2.34 $2.30 2% $2.30 $2.27 1 %Financial futures and options$0.49 $0.49 —% $0.49 $0.54 (10)%Open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently “open,” – in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration, or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange.

Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges. For NYSE cash equities, market share increased in 2018 due to increased equity market volatility, the commencement of trading on NYSE National and the acquisition of CHX. NYSE cash equities market share declined during 2017 due to historically low volatility driving more trading to off-exchange trading venues, particularly dark-pools. For NYSE equity options, 2018 market share improved due to greater equity market volatility and decreased in 2017 due to a strategic focus on maximizing revenues in an extremely competitive environment.Transaction-Based Expenses Our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government’s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals. We, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed to equal the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of payment by us may vary from collections. The fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the SEC semi-annually as required. The total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was $105 million as of December 31, 2018.52We make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue.Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginOur Trading and Clearing segment operating expenses increased $130 million in 2018 from 2017, and decreased $45 million in 2017 from 2016, partially related to the $33 million Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment expense recorded in 2016. See “- Consolidated Operating Expenses” below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses. Our Trading and Clearing segment operating income increased $162 million in 2018 from 2017, and increased $71 million in 2017 from 2016. Trading and Clearing segment operating margins were 62%, 63% and 61% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The operating income increases in the last two years were driven by the revenue increases discussed above.Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating expenses were $824 million, $714 million and $716 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating income was $1.6 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.4 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Trading and Clearing segment adjusted operating margins were 66% in 2018, 2017 and 2016. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.Data and Listings SegmentThe following charts and table present our selected statements of income data for our Data and Listings segment (dollars in millions): 53(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

Through ICE Data Services, we generate revenues from a range of global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, desktops and connectivity solutions. Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.In 2018, 2017 and 2016, 8%, 10% and 12%, respectively, of our Data and Listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros (all relating to our data services revenues). As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro during 2018, our data services revenues were higher by $7 million in 2018 than in 2017. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar during 2017, our data services revenues were lower by $8 million in 2017 than in 2016. Our data services revenues are primarily subscription-based and increased 1% in 2018 from 2017, and increased 5% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in revenues in both 2018 and 2017 were primarily due to the strong retention rate of 54existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers and increases in pricing of our products, partially offset by the divestitures of IDMS in March 2017 and Trayport in December 2017 within our desktop and connectivity business. The increase in revenue in 2017 from 2016 was also partially due to our acquisitions of TMX Atrium in May 2017 and BofAML's Global Research division’s index business in October 2017 and the impact of foreign currency translation.•Pricing and Analytics: Our pricing and analytics revenues increased 7% in 2018 from 2017 and increased 13% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in revenue were driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers, increases in pricing of our products and the acquisition and further distribution of the ICE BofAML Indices. •Exchange Data and Feeds: Our exchange data and feeds revenues increased 6% in 2018 from 2017 and increased 5% in 2017 from 2016. The increases in revenues were driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers and a larger share of the NMS Plan revenue.•Desktops and Connectivity: Our desktop and connectivity revenues decreased 17% in 2018 from 2017 and decreased 7% in 2017 from 2016 driven primarily by the divestitures of IDMS and Trayport in 2017.Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. ASV does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. ASV also does not include certain data services revenue streams that are not subscription-based. Revenue from ASV businesses has historically represented approximately 90% of our data revenues. Thus, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues. As of December 31, 2018, ASV was $1.922 billion, which increased 6.1% compared to the ASV as of December 31, 2017. This does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations or impacts of acquisitions. Underpinning this growth is strength in our pricing & analytics business.Listings RevenuesListings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges - original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. All listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over a two-year period, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be over a period of up to nine years for NYSE and up to five years for NYSE Arca and NYSE American. In addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges, which is generally estimated to be a period of six years for NYSE and three years for NYSE Arca and NYSE American. Our listings revenues increased 4% in 2018 from 2017 and decreased 1% in 2017 from 2016 due to changes in market conditions for IPOs.Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginOur Data and Listings segment operating expenses increased $7 million in 2018 from 2017, and decreased $36 million in 2017 from 2016. See “- Consolidated Operating Expenses” below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses. Our Data and Listings segment operating income increased $42 million in 2018 from 2017, and increased $136 million in 2017 from 2016. Our Data and Listings segment operating margins were 42%, 41% and 37% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The operating income and operating margin increases during 2018 and 2017 were driven by the revenue increases discussed above.Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating expenses were $1.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating income was $1.3 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our Data and Listings segment adjusted operating margins were 51%, 51% and 49% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.55Consolidated Operating Expenses The following presents our consolidated operating expenses (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Change 2017 2016 ChangeCompensation and benefits $994 $946 5 % $946 $953 (1)%Professional services 131 121 8 121 137 (12)Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs 34 36 (5) 36 80 (56)Technology and communication 432 397 9 397 374 6Rent and occupancy 68 69 (2) 69 70 (1)Selling, general and administrative 151 155 (3) 155 116 34Depreciation and amortization 586 535 10 535 610 (12)Total operating expenses $2,396 $2,259 6 % $2,259 $2,340 (3)%56The majority of our operating expenses do not vary directly with changes in our volume and revenues, except for certain technology and communication expenses and a portion of our compensation expense that is tied directly to our data sales or overall financial performance. We expect our operating expenses to increase in absolute terms in future periods in connection with our acquisitions and growth of our business, and to vary from year-to-year based on the type and level of our acquisitions, our integrations and other investments.In 2018, 2017 and 2016, 13%, 14% and 18%, respectively, of our operating expenses were incurred in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro in 2018, our consolidated operating expenses were higher by $12 million in 2018 than in 2017. Due to the weakening of the pound sterling and euro as compared to the U.S. dollar in 2017, our consolidated operating expenses were lower by $14 million in 2017 than in 2016. See Item 7(A) “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information.Compensation and Benefits Expenses Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and the individual employee performance. The performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in the number of employees. As of December 31, 2018, we had 5,161 employees, compared to 4,952 and 5,631 as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Our employee headcount increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to new employees related to the acquisitions of BondPoint in January 2018, CHX Holdings, Inc. and TMC Bonds in July 2018 and MERS in October 2018, partially offset by continued employee terminations associated with our integration of Interactive Data. Our employee headcount decreased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to the divestitures in 2017 of IDMS, Trayport and NYSE Governance Services, and employee terminations in connection with our integration of Interactive Data, partially offset by new employees related to the acquisitions of ICE NGX and TMX Atrium in 2017. See “- Recent Developments” above. Our compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to employee severance and retention costs and a net increase in our employee headcount, partially offset by a decrease in non-cash compensation expense. We incurred employee severance and retention costs of $41 million, $21 million and $10 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in compensation and benefits expenses in 2017 from 2016 was minimal.Non-cash compensation expenses recognized in our consolidated financial statements for employee stock options and restricted stock were $130 million, $135 million and $123 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The decrease in non-cash compensation expenses in 2018 from 2017 was primarily related to a change in ICE’s non-cash incentive plans that reduced the overall amount of non-cash incentives awarded. The increase in non-cash compensation expenses in 2017 from 2016 primarily relates to the integration of the Interactive Data employees into the ICE non-cash incentive plans.Professional Services Expenses This expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings. Professional services expenses increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to consulting and legal fees related to software development consulting costs. Professional services expenses decreased in 2017 from 2016 primarily due to the continued reduction in professional services and contractors at NYSE. We eliminated or replaced certain contractor positions with full-time employees at NYSE in 2016. In addition, during 2016, we recorded a credit from a third-party service provider related to fees charged in a prior period. Legal fees, which are included in professional services expenses, primarily related to class action lawsuits in which NYSE was a defendant. These decreases were partially offset by professional services expenses incurred by Interactive Data, Trayport, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis. Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration CostsIn 2018, we incurred $34 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily relating to employee terminations and lease terminations in connection with our our integrations of Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and 57Credit Market Analysis, professional services costs from our 2018 acquisitions, and a $5 million banker success fee in connection with our acquisition of TMC Bonds. The integration of Interactive Data was completed by June 30, 2018.In 2017, we incurred $36 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily relating to our integrations of Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and our acquisitions of BondPoint, TMX Atrium, the ICE BofAML Indices and NYSE National. Of this amount, $11 million was primarily related to the acquisitions. We incurred $25 million for Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis integration costs relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. In 2016, we incurred $80 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs primarily relating to our integrations of Interactive Data and NYSE, legal and professional fees related to the Trayport CMA review, our investment in MERS, our acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis, and various other potential and discontinued acquisitions. Of this amount, $41 million was primarily related to the acquisitions and other transaction costs. We incurred $39 million for Interactive Data and NYSE integration costs during 2016, primarily relating to employee and lease termination costs and professional services costs. The integration of NYSE was completed in 2016 and no NYSE integration costs were incurred after 2016. We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.Technology and Communication Expenses Technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connection for our electronic platforms, telecommunications costs, and fees paid for access to external market data. This expense also includes licensing and other fee agreement expenses which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly.Technology and communications expenses increased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to $17 million in data center migrations, hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments, $11 million in increased costs related to our recent acquisitions, net of divestitures, and $7 million in increased costs for external market data content acquisition and revenue share agreements related to our product offering. Technology and communications expenses increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to $14 million in increased hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments, and $10 million in costs related to our recent acquisitions, net of divestitures. Rent and Occupancy ExpensesRent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in and around Atlanta, New York and London with smaller offices located throughout the world. See Item 2 “- Properties” above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property. Excluding the impact of the acquisitions, rent and occupancy expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to reduced rent and occupancy costs realized from the continued consolidation of our Atlanta, New York and London office locations.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to $14 million in accruals relating to SEC investigations and inquiries made during 2017. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to the acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and $14 million in accruals relating to SEC investigations and inquiries. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and the SEC investigations and inquiries, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased the last two years primarily due to lower marketing expenses. Refer to Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements, included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for more information on the SEC investigations and inquiries. 58Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, planes, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life. We recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $289 million, $272 million and $323 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Amortization expense increased in 2018 from 2017, as a result of ICE NGX, BondPoint, TMC Bonds, the ICE BofAML Indices, MERS and TMX Atrium intangible assets. In addition, in 2018, we recorded a $4 million impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets related to our closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada as amortization expense. This increase in amortization expense was partially offset by a decrease in amortization recorded on our Russell license intangible assets in 2018 from 2017 due to these assets becoming fully amortized, and amortization expense recorded in 2017 as a result of the net loss of $6 million on the sale of NYSE Governance Services.The decrease in the amortization expenses recorded on the intangible assets in 2017 from 2016 is primarily due to a reduction in amortization expenses recorded on intangible assets which became fully amortized (primarily related to certain of the NYSE intangible assets) and the divestitures of Trayport and NYSE Governance Services, partially offset by amortization expenses recorded on the Securities Evaluations, Credit Market Analysis, ICE NGX and TMX Atrium intangible assets. In 2016, we recorded an impairment of the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset of $33 million, which was recorded in depreciation and amortization expenses. In 2016, we sold certain of Creditex’s U.S. voice brokerage operations to Tullett Prebon and discontinued Creditex’s U.K. voice brokerage operations. We continue to operate Creditex’s electronically traded markets and systems, post-trade connectivity platforms and intellectual property. We recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $293 million, $257 million and $254 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, with the increase in 2018 primarily due to depreciation resulting from increased software development.Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expense) Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Change 2017 2016 ChangeOther income (expense): Interest income$22 $8 174 % $8 $3 135%Interest expense $(244) $(187) 31 % $(187) $(178) 5%Other income, net 159 326 (51) 326 46 n/aTotal other income (expense), net $(63) $147 n/a $147 $(129) n/a Net income attributable to non-controlling interest $(32) $(28) 12 % $(28) $(27) 5%Interest IncomeWe recognized interest income on our investments of $22 million, $8 million and $3 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest income increased in 2018 from 2017 primarily due to a rise in short-term interest rates on various investments.Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased in 2018 from 2017, primarily due to an increase in the principal and coupon of our bond refinancing in August 2018, as well as a rise in short-term interest rates impacting our Commercial Paper Program. Interest expense increased in 2017 from 2016, primarily due to interest expense that we recognized relating to our bond refinancing in August 2017, partially offset by the September 2017 repayment of $850 million of 2.00% senior unsecured fixed rate notes that were due in October 2017. See “- Debt” below. 59Other income, netIn December 2017, we sold Trayport to TMX Group for £550 million ($733 million). We recognized a net gain of $110 million on the divestiture of Trayport, which was recorded as other income in 2017.In connection with Cetip’s merger with BM&FBOVESPA S.A., now B3, and its subsequent sale, we recognized a $176 million realized investment gain in other income in 2017 and $9 million in foreign exchange losses and transaction expenses in other expense in 2017. We recognized dividend income received relating to our investment in Cetip in other income, which was $5 million and $17 million in 2017 and 2016, respectively. We no longer receive dividends from Cetip subsequent to its sale in the first quarter of 2017.We account for our investments in The Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, and MERS until our October 2018 acquisition of MERS, as equity method investments. We recognized $46 million, $36 million and $25 million in equity income related to these investments during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, as other income. Prior to October 2018, we owned a majority stake in MERS and treated it as an equity method investment because we did not have the ability to control its operations. On October 3, 2018, we completed the purchase of all remaining interests of MERS and subsequently own 100% of MERS. On that date, we gained control of MERS, began to include MERS's results as part of our consolidated operations and recognized a $110 million gain on our initial investment value in MERS as other income. MERS is now part of ICE Mortgage Services. In connection with our equity investment in Euroclear, we recognized dividend income of $15 million in 2018, which is included in other income.In connection with our adoption of ASU 2017-07, we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our definedbenefit plans in the income statement as non-operating income on a full retrospective basis. The combined net periodic (expense) benefit of these plans was ($8 million) and $9 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively.We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $4 million and $1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded in other income, net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur through our foreign operations that are received in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. See Item 7A “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information on these items.Non-controlling InterestFor consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as non-controlling interest in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, non-controlling interests included those related to the operating results of our CDS clearing subsidiaries in which non-ICE limited partners held a 42.5% net profit sharing interest; ICE Endex in which Gasunie held a 21% ownership interest; and ICE Clear Netherlands in which ABN AMRO Clearing held a 25% ownership interest.In 2017, we purchased both Gasunie’s 21% interest in ICE Endex and ABN AMRO Clearing’s 25% interest in ICE Clear Netherlands. Subsequent to these acquisitions, we own 100% of ICE Endex and ICE Clear Netherlands and no longer include any non-controlling interest related to either company in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, in 2017, we purchased 12.6% of the net profit sharing interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries from several non-ICE limited partners and the remaining partners held a 29.9% net profit sharing interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. During September 2018, we purchased a 3.2% interest in a non-ICE limited partner of our CDS clearing subsidiaries, and the remaining non-ICE limited partners hold a 26.7% ownership interest as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, there are no other non-controlling interests included in our consolidated financial statements, other than that related to the non-ICE partners in Bakkt. Refer to Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report.In December 2018, Bakkt, LLC, or Bakkt, a newly formed entity, was capitalized with $183 million in initial funding by us as majority owner, along with a group of other minority investors. We hold a call option over these interests subject to certain terms, similarly the non-ICE partners in Bakkt hold a put option to require us to repurchase their interests subject to certain 60terms. These minority interests are reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in temporary equity within our consolidated balance sheet.Consolidated Income Tax Provision Consolidated income tax expense (benefit) was $500 million, ($28 million) and $586 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change in consolidated income tax expense (benefit) between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate each year. Our effective tax rate was 20%, (1)% and 29% in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The effective tax rate in 2018 is lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the enactment of the TCJA which reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. The 2018 effective tax rate was further reduced due to tax benefits from the acquisition of MERS, deferred tax benefits from changes in estimates and additional tax benefits associated with our sale of Trayport in 2017. See “- Recent Developments” above. The effective tax rates in 2017 and 2016 are lower than the federal statutory rate primarily due to favorable U.S. and U.K. tax law changes and favorable foreign income tax rate differentials, partially offset by state income taxes. Favorable foreign income tax rate differentials result primarily from lower income tax rates in the U.K. and various other lower tax jurisdictions as compared to the historical income tax rates in the U.S. The reductions in U.S. and U.K. corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits in the respective periods of enactment. The impact of the deferred tax benefits for the U.S. and U.K. corporate income tax rate reductions in 2017 and 2016 lowered the effective tax rates by 30% and 2%, respectively, and resulted in deferred tax benefits of $764 million and $34 million, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate in 2017 from 2016, is primarily due to the deferred tax benefit associated with the future U.S. income tax rate reduction and tax benefits associated with a divestiture in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the deferred tax benefit from the U.K. corporate income tax reduction in the third quarter of 2016, additional tax expense from an Illinois corporate income tax rate increase enacted in the third quarter of 2017, and an income tax expense increase due to a relatively higher U.S. mix of income in 2017. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report, for additional information on these tax items.Quarterly Results of Operations The following quarterly unaudited consolidated statements of income data have been prepared on substantially the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and include all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations for the quarters presented. The historical results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for any future period. This unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly data should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report. The following table sets forth quarterly consolidated statements of income data (in millions): Three Months Ended, December 31, 2018 September 30, 2018 June 30, 2018 March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017Revenues: Energy futures and options contracts$257 $223 $250 $235 $227 $223 $231 $228Agricultural and metals futures and options contracts54 58 74 65 49 49 62 56Financial futures and options contracts92 77 94 91 72 82 89 83Cash equities and equity options462 335 389 438 365 355 390 381Fixed income and credit83 56 45 56 32 37 33 37OTC and other transactions13 11 12 13 13 12 12 13Total transaction and clearing, net961 760 864 898 758 758 817 798Pricing and analytics264 263 262 254 248 242 242 238Exchange data and feeds174 168 164 164 160 156 161 155Desktops and connectivity101 99 100 102 117 120 118 127Total data services539 530 526 520 525 518 521 520Listings112 112 111 109 104 105 109 108Other revenues65 61 55 53 54 54 49 45Total revenues1,677 1,463 1,556 1,580 1,441 1,435 1,496 1,471Transaction-based expenses369 263 310 355 295 289 316 305Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses1,308 1,200 1,246 1,225 1,146 1,146 1,180 1,16661 Three Months Ended, December 31, 2018 September 30, 2018 June 30, 2018 March 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 September 30, 2017 June 30, 2017 March 31, 2017Compensation and benefits262 251 241 240 229 234 236 247Professional services40 32 29 30 27 30 32 32Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs1 6 15 12 9 4 9 14Technology and communication112 107 108 105 103 99 97 98Rent and occupancy18 17 16 17 17 17 17 18Selling, general and administrative42 37 39 33 38 38 38 41Depreciation and amortization157 148 143 138 131 128 142 134Total operating expenses632 598 591 575 554 550 571 584Operating income676 602 655 650 592 596 609 582Other income (expense), net (1)62 (48) (44) (33) 79 (33) (42) 143Income tax expense (benefit) (2)119 89 149 143 (568) 186 140 214Net income$619 $465 $462 $474 $1,239 $377 $427 $511Net income attributable to non-controlling interest(8) (7) (7) (10) (6) (6) (8) (8)Net income attributable to Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.$611 $458 $455 $464 $1,233 $371 $419 $503(1) Other income (expense), net includes the following: a $110 million gain in connection with our acquisition of MERS (see “- Recent Developments” above); a $110 million gain on our sale of Trayport for the three months ended December 31, 2017; and in connection with the Cetip merger and its subsequent sale, $9 million in foreign tax losses and transaction expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and a $176 million realized investment gain for the three months ended March 31, 2017.(2) The decrease in the income tax expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 is primarily due to a $764 million deferred tax benefit associated with future U.S. income tax reductions, and the decrease for the three months ended June 30, 2017 is primarily due to the tax benefit associated with a divestiture. See “- Consolidated Income Tax Provision” above.62Liquidity and Capital Resources Below are charts that reflect our capital allocation. The acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received for divestitures, cash paid for investments, cash paid for non-controlling interest and redeemable non-controlling interest, and the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, net of divestitures, in each year.We have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends and the development of our technology platforms. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt, but we may also need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities in the future. See “- Future Capital Requirements” below. See “- Recent Developments” above for a discussion of the acquisitions and investments that we made during 2018. These acquisitions and investments were initially funded from borrowing under our Commercial Paper Program along with cash flows from operations and subsequently refinanced with our 2018 debt issuance.Our Commercial Paper Program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. We repaid a net amount of $283 million under our Commercial Paper Program during 2018.Upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. To mitigate this risk, we maintain an undrawn back-stop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount equaling at any time the amount issued under our Commercial Paper Program. If we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the back-stop revolving 63facility. However, electing to do so would result in higher interest expense. For a discussion of our Commercial Paper Program and other indebtedness, see “- Debt” below.Consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $724 million and $535 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We had $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We consider all short-term, highly-liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We classify all investments with original maturity dates in excess of three months but less than one year as short-term investments and all investments that we intend to hold for more than one year as long-term investments. Short-term and long-term investments are included in other current and other non-current assets, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents that are not available for general use, either due to regulatory requirements or through restrictions in specific agreements, are classified as restricted cash and cash equivalents and investments. As of December 31, 2018, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was $253 million. Due to U.S. tax reform, a significant amount of 2018 current-year undistributed earnings within our non-U.S. subsidiaries (in excess of their unrestricted cash balance) have been subject to the Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income provisions under the TCJA. Accordingly, these earnings have been subject to immediate U.S. income taxation and any non-U.S. unrestricted cash balances can be distributed to the U.S. in the future with no material additional income tax consequences.Our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. We may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.Repurchases of our common stock may be made from time to time on the open market, through established trading plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, we repurchased 16.3 million shares, 15.0 million shares and 0.9 million shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $1.2 billion, $949 million and $50 million, respectively. The shares repurchased are held in treasury stock and were completed on the open market and under Rule 10b5-1 trading plans.From time to time, we enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, as authorized by our Board of Directors, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. The timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. In making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, management considers multiple factors, including overall stock market conditions, our common stock price movements, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our Board of Directors, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.In August 2016, our Board of Directors approved an aggregate of $1.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date. In September 2017, our Board of Directors approved an aggregate of $1.2 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective on January 1, 2018. In September 2018, our Board of Directors approved an aggregate of $2.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective January 1, 2019. We expect this authorization to provide us with capacity for buybacks over six quarters and flexibility to act opportunistically. We expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program or our debt facilities. We may discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time. The approval of our Board of Directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time.Cash Flow The following table presents the major components of net changes in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions):64 Year Ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$2,533 $2,085 $2,149Investing activities(1,755) 92 (860)Financing activities(463) (1,971) (1,462)Effect of exchange rate changes (11) 12 (24)Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents$304 $218 $(197)In the fourth quarter of 2017, we adopted a new accounting standard, FASB ASU 2016-18, which requires that the changes in the total cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents be reflected in the statement of cash flows. As a result, we no longer present transfers between cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents in our statement of cash flows. We have reclassified changes in restricted cash from cash flows provided by (used in) investing activities, to the total change in beginning and end-of-year total changes. Our statements of cash flows for 2018, 2017 and 2016 reflect this change.Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital.The $448 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2018 from 2017, is primarily a result of the increase in our net income excluding our net non-cash adjustments, fluctuations in our working capital, less cash paid for income taxes in 2018 than in 2017, and a $136 million contribution that was made to our pension plan in 2017. The non-cash adjustments include our MERS investment gain of $110 million during 2018, as well as our deferred tax benefit of $764 million due to tax reform, our gain on the sale of our Cetip investment of $114 million and our Trayport gain of $110 million during 2017. The $136 million contribution to our pension plan in 2017 allowed us to reach 99% funding of our pension obligation and allowed us to immunize the liability against future market fluctuations. For additional information on our pension plan, refer to Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements.The $64 million decrease in net cash provided by operating activities in 2017 from 2016 is primarily due to the $136 million pension plan contribution in 2017, compared to a $10 million contribution in 2016. Investing Activities Consolidated net cash provided by (used in) investing activities in 2018, 2017 and 2016 primarily relates to cash paid for acquisitions, cash received from divestitures, net cash received from the sale of our investment in Cetip, purchases of investments, proceeds from term deposits, and changes in capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. We paid cash for acquisitions, net of the cash of the companies acquired, of $1.2 billion, $423 million and $425 million, in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily relating to the BondPoint, TMC Bonds and MERS acquisitions during 2018, the ICE NGX, Shorcan Energy, now named CalRock Brokers, Inc., or CalRock, the ICE BofAML indices and TMX Atrium acquisitions during 2017, and the Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis acquisitions during 2016. In 2017, we received $761 million relating to the sales of Trayport, IDMS and NYSE Governance Services and we received net cash proceeds from the sale of our investment in Cetip of $438 million. We made cash investments of $306 million, $327 million and $70 million during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, in Euroclear, MERS and OCC. See “- Recent Developments” above for more details on our 2018 acquisitions, divestitures and investments. We had capital expenditures of $134 million, $220 million and $250 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $146 million, $137 million and $115 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware and software purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements associated with the new and renovated office spaces in Atlanta, New York and London. The software development expenditures primarily relate to the continued development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms, data services and clearing houses.Financing Activities Consolidated net cash used in financing activities in 2018 primarily relates to $1.2 billion in repurchases of common stock, $600 million in repayments of our October 2018 Senior Notes, $555 million in dividend payments to our stockholders, $283 65million in net repayments under our Commercial Paper Program, and $80 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises, partially offset by $2.2 billion in net proceeds from our Senior Notes issued in 2018 (the 2023, 2028 and 2048 Senior Notes). See “- Debt” below.Consolidated net cash used in financing activities in 2017 primarily relates to $984 million in net proceeds from the 2022 Senior Notes and 2027 Senior Notes offerings, $850 million in repayments of the NYSE Notes, $409 million in net repayments under our Commercial Paper Program, $949 million in repurchases of common stock, $476 million in dividend payments to our stockholders, $174 million in acquisitions of non-controlling interest and redeemable non-controlling interest and $88 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises.Consolidated net cash used in financing activities in 2016 primarily relates to $949 million in net repayments under our Commercial Paper Program, $409 million in dividend payments to our stockholders, $54 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises and $50 million in repurchases of common stock.Debt Our total debt, including short-term and long-term debt, consisted of the following: As of December 31, 2018 2017Debt:(in millions)Short-term debt: Commercial Paper$951 $1,2332018 Senior Notes (2.50% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2018) — 600Total short-term debt 951 1,833Long-term debt: 2020 Senior Notes (2.75% senior unsecured notes due December 1, 2020)1,246 1,2442022 Senior Notes (2.35% senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2022)496 4952023 Senior Notes (3.45% senior unsecured notes due September 21, 2023)397 —2023 Senior Notes (4.00% senior unsecured notes due October 15, 2023) 793 7912025 Senior Notes (3.75% senior unsecured notes due December 1, 2025)1,243 1,2422027 Senior Notes (3.10% senior unsecured notes due September 15, 2027)496 4952028 Senior Notes (3.75% senior unsecured notes due September 21, 2028)591 —2048 Senior Notes (4.25% senior unsecured notes due September 21, 2048)1,228 —Total long-term debt6,490 4,267Total debt$7,441 $6,100The following summarizes significant developments and changes associated with our debt:Amended Credit FacilityWe have a $3.4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as primary administrative agent, issuing lender and swing-line lender, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. On August 9, 2018, we extended the final maturity date of the credit facility from August 18, 2022 to August 9, 2023, and made certain other changes, herein referred to as the Amended Credit Facility.The Amended Credit Facility includes an option for us to propose an increase in the aggregate amount available for borrowing by up to $975 million, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions. No amounts were outstanding under the Amended Credit Facility as of December 31, 2018. As of December 31, 2018, of the $3.4 billion that is currently available, $951 million is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program, and $105 million is required to support certain broker-dealer subsidiary commitments. The amount required to backstop the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining $2.3 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program. 66Commercial Paper ProgramWe have a U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program. It is currently backed by the borrowing capacity available under the Amended Credit Facility, as described above. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances does not materially differ from short-term interest rates (such as USD LIBOR), which fluctuate due to market conditions and as a result may impact our interest expense.We repaid a net amount of $283 million of outstanding commercial paper during 2018 using cash flows from operations and cash proceeds received from our 2018 bond issuance. We repaid $409 million of net notes outstanding under the program during 2017 primarily using cash proceeds received from the sales of Cetip and Trayport. These reductions were partially offset by notes we issued under the program during 2017, the proceeds of which were used to fund acquisitions and investments and repurchase our common stock. We used net proceeds from notes issued under the program during 2016 for the acquisitions of Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis and for general corporate purposes. We repaid a portion of the amounts outstanding under the program during 2018, 2017 and 2016 with cash flows from operations. Commercial paper notes of $951 million with original maturities ranging from two to 77 days were outstanding as of December 31, 2018 with a weighted average interest rate of 2.48% per annum, and a weighted average maturity of 12 days. Commercial paper notes of $1.2 billion with original maturities ranging from two to 64 days were outstanding as of December 31, 2017 with a weighted average interest rate of 1.49% per annum, and a weighted average maturity of 18 days.Senior Notes•Newly-Issued Senior Notes: In August 2018, we issued $2.25 billion in new aggregate unsecured fixed-rate senior notes, including $400 million, 3.45% notes due in 2023, or the 2023 Senior Notes, $600 million, 3.75% notes due in 2028, or the 2028 Senior Notes, and $1.25 billion, 4.25% notes due in 2048, or the 2048 Senior Notes, and together with the 2023 Senior Notes and the 2028 Senior Notes, the Newly-Issued Senior Notes. We used the proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including to fund the redemption of the $600 million, 2.50% Senior Notes due October 2018 and to refinance all of our issuances under our Commercial Paper Program that resulted from acquisitions and investments in the last year. See “- Recent Developments” above.•2022 and 2027 Senior Notes: In August 2017, we issued $1.0 billion in aggregate unsecured fixed-rate senior notes, including $500 million, 2.35% notes due September 2022, or the 2022 Senior Notes, and $500 million, 3.10% notes due September 2027, or the 2027 Senior Notes. We used the majority of the proceeds from the offering to fund the redemption in September 2017 of $850 million, 2.00% senior unsecured fixed-rate NYSE Notes prior to the October 2017 maturity date. •2020 and 2025 Senior Notes: In November 2015, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate senior unsecured fixed rate notes, including $1.25 billion, 2.75% notes due November 2020, or the 2020 Senior Notes, and $1.25 billion, 3.75% notes due November 2025, or the 2025 Senior Notes. We used the proceeds from the offering, together with $1.6 billion of borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program, to finance the cash portion of the purchase price of Interactive Data. •October 2023 Senior Notes: In October 2013, we issued $800 million, 4.00% senior unsecured fixed-rate notes due October 2023, or the October 2023 Senior Notes. We used the net proceeds from the October 2023 Senior Notes to finance a portion of the purchase price of the acquisition of NYSE.Committed Repo and Committed FX FacilitiesTo provide a tool to address the liquidity needs of our clearing houses and manage the liquidation of margin and guaranty fund deposits held in the form of cash and high quality sovereign debt, ICE Clear Europe, ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear U.S. have entered into Committed Repurchase Agreement Facilities, or Committed Repo. Additionally, ICE Clear Credit has entered into Committed FX Facilities to support these liquidity needs. As of December 31, 2018 the following facilities were in place:•ICE Clear Europe: $1.2 billion in Committed Repo to finance U.S. dollar, euro and pound sterling deposits.•ICE Clear Credit: $300 million in Committed Repo to finance U.S. dollar and euro deposits, €250 million in Committed Repo to finance euro deposits, and €1.9 billion in Committed FX Facilities to finance euro payment obligations.•ICE Clear US: $250 million in Committed Repo to finance U.S. dollar deposits.67Future Capital Requirements Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our Trading and Clearing and Data and Listings segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases. We currently expect to incur capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between $290 million and $320 million in 2019, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses. In September 2018, our Board of Directors approved an aggregate of $2.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective on January 1, 2019. We expect this authorization to provide us with capacity for buybacks over six quarters and flexibility to act opportunistically. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report, for additional details on our stock repurchase plans. Our Board of Directors has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the board or its Audit Committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined net income payout ratio. During 2018, we paid cash dividends of $0.96 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including quarterly dividends of $0.24 per share, for an aggregate payout of $555 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years. For the first quarter of 2019, we announced a $0.275 per share dividend payable on March 29, 2019 to stockholders of record as of March 15, 2019.As of December 31, 2018, we had $7.4 billion in outstanding debt. We currently also have a $3.4 billion Amended Credit Facility, of which $2.3 billion is available for general corporate purposes as previously described. Other than the facilities discussed above for the ICE Clearing Houses, the Amended Credit Facility and our Commercial Paper Program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties. In the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. However, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. See “-Risk Factors"" and ""- Debt” above.Non-GAAP Measures We use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent GAAP measures or that supplement the information provided by our GAAP measures. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this Annual Report, and believe that these measures, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making period-to-period comparisons of results because the adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.The table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders and adjusted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business 68performance. These measures, including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts), are as follows: Trading and Clearing Segment Data and Listings Segment Consolidated Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses$2,420 $2,128 $2,102 $2,559 $2,510 $2,410 $4,979 $4,638 $4,512Operating expenses911 781 826 1,485 1,478 1,514 2,396 2,259 2,340Less: Interactive Data and NYSE transaction and integration costs and acquisition-related success fees 6 — 1 24 31 45 30 31 46Less: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles73 53 72 214 208 230 287 261 302Less: Accruals relating to investigations and inquiries— 14 — — — — — 14 —Less: Employee severance costs related to Creditex U.K. brokerage operations— — 4 — — — — — 4Less: Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment— — 33 — — — — — 33Less: Impairment on divestiture of NYSE Governance Services— — — — 6 — — 6 —Less: Impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada4 — — — — — 4 — —Less: Employee severance costs related to ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada operations4 — — — — — 4 — —Adjusted operating expenses$824 $714 $716 $1,247 $1,233 $1,239 $2,071 $1,947 $1,955Operating income$1,509 $1,347 $1,276 $1,074 $1,032 $896 $2,583 $2,379 $2,172Adjusted operating income$1,596 $1,414 $1,386 $1,312 $1,277 $1,171 $2,908 $2,691 $2,557Operating margin62% 63% 61% 42% 41% 37% 52% 51% 48%Adjusted operating margin66% 66% 66% 51% 51% 49% 58% 58% 57% Net income attributable to ICE common stockholders $1,988 $2,526 $1,430Add: Interactive Data and NYSE transaction and integration costs and acquisition-related success fees 30 31 46Add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 287 261 302Less: Gain on acquisition of MERS (110) — —Add: Accruals relating to investigations and inquiries — 14 —Add: Employee severance costs related to Creditex U.K. brokerage operations — — 4Add: Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment — — 33Add: Impairment on divestiture of NYSE Governance Services — 6 —Add: Impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada 4 — —Add: Employee severance costs related to ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada operations 4 — —Less: Gain on divestiture of Trayport, net 1 (110) —Less: Cetip investment gain, net — (167) —Less: Income tax effect for the above items (98) (43) (143)Less: Deferred tax adjustments from U.S. tax rate reduction (11) (764) —Add/(Less): Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles (5) 10 (22)Add/(Less): Other tax adjustments (13) — 23Adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders $2,077 $1,764 $1,673 Basic earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders $3.46 $4.29 $2.40Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders $3.43 $4.25 $2.39 Adjusted basic earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders $3.61 $2.99 $2.81Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders $3.59 $2.97 $2.79 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 575 589 595Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 579 594 59969Acquisition-related transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. However, we adjust for the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to Interactive Data and NYSE given the sizes of these acquisitions. The integration of NYSE was completed by June 2016 and the integration of Interactive Data was completed by June 2018. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-GAAP adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results. In addition, we also include the following items as non-GAAP adjustments, as each of these are not considered a part of our core business operations:•2018: the gain recognized on our initial majority investment in MERS in connection with our acquisition of 100% of the remaining MERS interests;•2018: the impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets and employee severance costs related to the closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada; •2017: the net gain on the divestiture of Trayport, and in 2018, a subsequent adjustment to reduce of the gain on the divestiture;•2017: the realized investment gain and the foreign exchange loss and transaction expenses on the sale of our investment in Cetip;•2017: accruals relating to investigations and inquiries; •2017: the NYSE Governance Services net impairment loss on its divestiture; and•2016: the Creditex U.K. voice brokerage severance costs related to its discontinuance and the Creditex customer relationship intangible asset impairment loss. The tax items in non-GAAP adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments or tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance. The following tax-related items are included as non-GAAP adjustments:•The income tax effects relating to all non-GAAP adjustments;•Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles; including the impact of U.S. state tax law changes and apportionment updates, as well as foreign tax law changes which resulted in deferred tax (benefit) expense of ($5 million), $10 million and ($22 million) in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In addition, deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include $34 million of deferred tax benefits due to U.K. corporate income tax rate reductions in 2016;•Deferred tax benefits of $11 million and $764 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, resulting from changes in estimates as a result of the enactment of the TCJA which reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%;•2018: Other tax adjustments including a $17 million tax benefit on the sale of Trayport offset by an audit settlement for a pre-acquisition period in connection with our acquisition of NYSE in 2013; and •2016: Other tax adjustments including a $15 million valuation allowance on Singapore pre-acquisition net operating losses and other deferred tax assets and an $8 million deferred tax adjustment with respect to our OCC equity method investment. For additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and “- Recent Developments,” “- Consolidated Operating Expenses”, “- Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” and “-Consolidated Income Tax Provision” above.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.70Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following presents our contractual obligations (which we intend to fund from existing cash as well as cash flow from operations) and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2018 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 YearsContractual Obligations: Short-term and long-term debt and interest $10,143 $1,192 $2,371 $1,522 $5,058Operating lease obligations 417 64 121 99 133Purchase obligations298 222 70 6 —Total contractual cash obligations $10,858 $1,478 $2,562 $1,627 $5,191Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.We have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments listed above $64.0 billion in cash margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable. Clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. The cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ICE NGX administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. It has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physically-settled contract, each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable. We have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or UTBs. As of December 31, 2018, our cumulative UTBs were $98 million. Interest and penalties related to UTBs were $28 million as of December 31, 2018. We are under examination by various tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. It is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our UTBs. As of December 31, 2018, in connection with our acquisition of NYSE, we have obligations related to our pension and other benefit programs. The date of payment under these obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. See note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs. We have a 40% ownership in OCC. Under the OCC’s capital plan, the OCC stockholders have committed to contribute up to $200 million in equity capital if certain capital thresholds are breached, including up to $80 million to be contributed by NYSE, which has also been excluded from the table above.In 2016, the SEC approved a plan to establish a market-wide consolidated audit trail, or CAT, to improve regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity. In 2018, the first phase of implementation went live and required participants to begin reporting to the CAT, with a phased implementation of the provisions of the CAT through 2019. Funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT is ultimately expected to be provided by both the execution venues and industry members. To date, however, funding has been provided solely by the execution venues in exchange for promissory notes expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the SEC and are collected to fund the CAT. New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “- 71Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and re-evaluate them on a periodic basis. Based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. The values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets, including identified intangible assets. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, trademarks, technology, trading products, data, exchange registrations, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments and estimates may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not. In performing the allocation of the acquisitions' purchase price to assets and liabilities, we consider, among other factors, the intended use of the acquired assets, analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. At the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. We continue to review and assess our estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by GAAP, which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.We allocate goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the business combination. We have identified four reporting units: our Futures reporting unit, our Data and Listings reporting unit, our Cash Equities reporting unit, and our Fixed Income and CDS reporting unit. Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. Goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. The initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. However, if the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. For annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. Otherwise, we can skip the two-step methodology and do not need to perform any further testing. For annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have 72the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount. Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. These estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. The cash flows employed in the discounted cash flow analysis are based on our most recent budgets and business plans and, when applicable, various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period. Future events could cause us to conclude that indicators of impairment exist for goodwill or other intangible assets. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of our business, adverse market conditions, adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations, competition, or the sale or disposition of a reporting unit. Any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.We are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. If an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. Fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., U.K. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, or SAB 118, provided guidance for companies that had not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. As of December 31, 2018, we have completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the TCJA. We reaffirmed our position that we were not subject to transition tax under the TCJA as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we concluded that the $764 million of deferred tax benefit recorded in the 2017 financial statements was a reasonable estimate of the TCJA’s impact on our deferred tax and no further adjustments are necessary. The FASB Staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. We have completed our analysis of the effects of these provisions and have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred.We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.We operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We record accruals for the estimated 73outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. ITEM 7 (A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash, short-term and long-term investments and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term investments were $2.0 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, of which $275 million and $293 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or Canadian dollars. The remaining cash and cash equivalents, and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. A hypothetical decrease in long-term interest rates to zero basis points would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $25 million as of December 31, 2018, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2018, we had $7.4 billion in outstanding debt, of which $6.5 billion relates to our senior notes, which bear interest at fixed interest rates. The remaining amount outstanding of $951 million relates to the Commercial Paper Program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in long-term interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2018 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $10 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. See Item 7 “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Debt” included in this Annual Report. The interest rates on our Commercial Paper Program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. The weighted average interest rate on our Commercial Paper Program increased from 1.49% as of December 31, 2017 to 2.48% as of December 31, 2018. The increase in the Commercial Paper Program weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve in March 2018, June 2018, September 2018, and in December 2018 to increase the federal funds short-term interest rate by an aggregate 100 basis points to 2.50%. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuance will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in short-term interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk As an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling, Canadian dollars or euros, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. Certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. Our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2018 and 2017 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates): 74 Year Ended December 31, 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Pound Sterling Euro Pound Sterling EuroAverage exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the current year period$1.3356 $1.1813 $1.2890 $1.1297Average exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the same period in the prior year$1.2890 $1.1297 $1.3603 $1.1075Average exchange rate increase (decrease)4% 5% (5)% 2%Foreign denominated percentage of: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses9% 5% 10 % 4%Operating expenses11% 2% 12 % 3%Operating income7% 7% 9 % 6%Impact of the currency fluctuations (1) on: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses$16 $10 $(26) $4Operating expenses$9 $2 $(14) $1Operating income$7 $8 $(12) $3(1)Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.We have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, 14%, 15% and 15%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 13%, 14%, and 18%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables occur through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $2 million, $4 million and $1 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The foreign currency transactions losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. A 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2018, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity, would result in no additional foreign currency gain or loss.We entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2018, 2017 and 2016 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. Although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities. We have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. Our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): As of December 31, 2018 Position in pounds sterling Position in Canadian dollars Position in eurosAssets£822 C$2,057 €136 of which goodwill represents638 413 92Liabilities78 1,651 40Net currency position£744 C$406 €96Net currency position, in $USD$950 $298 $110Negative impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates$95 $30 $11As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the portion of our equity attributable to accumulated other comprehensive loss from foreign currency translation was $227 million and $136 million, respectively. In 2018, 2017 and 2016, currency exchange rate differences had a positive/(negative) impact of ($91 million), $209 million and ($300 million), respectively, on our 75consolidated equity. The decrease in 2018 is primarily due to the decrease in the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate to 1.2756 as of December 31, 2018 (from 1.3510 as of December 31, 2017) due to the weakening of the pound sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar. The increase in 2017 is primarily due to the increase in the pound sterling/U.S. dollar exchange rate to 1.3510 as of December 31, 2017 (from 1.2336 as of December 31, 2016) due to the strengthening pound sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar. The future impact on our business relating to the U.K. leaving the EU and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.Credit Risk We are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments, monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests. Clearing House Cash Deposit RisksThe ICE Clearing Houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. Refer to Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ICE Clearing Houses' cash and cash equivalent deposits, which were $64.0 billion as of December 31, 2018. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the ICE Clearing Houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the clearing members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.•Credit Risk: When a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. Credit risk is monitored by using exposure limits depending on ratings assigned by rating agencies as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. Our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. We seek to substantially mitigate credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.•Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. To mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.•Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value. Our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments. For example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. In addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, U.S. Treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (Euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities. •Security Issuer Risk: Security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments. •Investment Counterparty Risk: Investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers. When engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house 76control. Additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. The typical haircut for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount which provides additional excess collateral. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty’s obligation.The ICE Clearing Houses may use third-party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house. Such advisors do not hold clearing member cash or cash equivalent deposits or the underlying investments. Clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians including JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., Citibank N.A., BNY Mellon, BMO Harris N.A. and Euroclear Bank Brussels (for non-U.S. dollar deposits). The ICE Clearing Houses employ (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives. •Cross-Currency Margin Deposit Risk: Each of the ICE Clearing Houses may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in U.S. dollars to secure a Euro margin obligation). The ICE Clearing Houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility. Cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.Impact of Inflation We have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. In the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.77",2023-12-30 20:40:42.492981

The increase in revenues includes $34 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2019 from 2018.•Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $341 million in 2018 from 2017. The increase in revenues includes $26 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 from 2017. •Operating expenses increased $133 million in 2019 from 2018. The increase in operating expenses includes $14 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2019 from 2018. •Operating expenses increased $137 million in 2018 from 2017. The increase in operating expenses includes $11 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2018 from 2017. •In connection with our acquisition of MERS, we recorded a $110 million gain in other income during 2018. In connection with Cetip’s merger with BM&FBOVESPA S.A., now B3, we recognized a $167 million net realized investment gain in other income/(expense), net in 2017. We also recognized a net gain of $110 million in connection with our divestiture of Trayport in other income/(expense), net in 2017.•The 2019 effective tax rate is higher than the 2018 effective tax rate primarily due to the 2018 discrete tax benefits from the acquisition of MERS and the divestiture of Trayport exceeding the net increased tax benefits recorded in 2019 from certain international tax provisions under the U.S. Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA.•Excluding the 2017 deferred tax benefit from the U.S. tax law changes, the 2018 effective tax rate is lower than the 2017 effective tax rate due to the TCJA, which reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, tax benefits from our acquisition of MERS, our divestiture of Trayport and deferred tax benefits from the U.S. tax rate reduction resulting from changes in estimates. Business Environment and Market TrendsOur business environment has been characterized by:•globalization of marketplaces, customers and competitors; •commodity, interest rate and financial markets uncertainty;•growing demand for data to inform customers' risk management and investment decisions;•evolving, increasing and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions;•price volatility increasing customers' demand for risk management services;•increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies;•customers' preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity;•the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements;•rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; and•consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.Recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several non-U.S. regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” included in this Annual Report, Brexit, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or trading activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 34% in 2014 to 51% in 2019. This non-transaction revenue includes data services and listings.We have invested, and continue to invest significant resources, in our proprietary ICE Global Network and cybersecurity protections to minimize the potential impact of a wide-scale cyber interruption, system outages or global regulatory drive to 48move critical infrastructure and/or sensitive financial transactions away from the public Internet. We believe that our current and historic investments in this space position us well competitively to accommodate increased costs of compliance, assurance, or incident response, however, trends in nationalism and data privacy could result in requirements that necessitate increases in staffing or the introduction of local data collection, and such requirements could undermine our synergistic centralized service model. Further, a prolonged and impactful cyber-attack on any of our market participants could drive the industry away from electronification and reduce the market advantages we have realized through automation.Many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: •increasing global regulatory demands; •greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; •greater emphasis on risk management; •market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; •the move to passive investing and indexation; •ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; •increased automation of fixed income and other less automated markets; •the development of new data products; •the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; •new entrants; and •increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, and prudently manage expenses, in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing and markets.Segment Results Our business is conducted through two reportable business segments: •Trading and Clearing, which comprises our transaction-based execution and clearing businesses; and•Data and Listings, which comprises our subscription-based data services and securities listings businesses. While revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of both segments. We use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment. Further, we did not allocate expenses to specific revenue streams within these segments since such an allocation is not reasonably possible. Our two segments do not engage in intersegment transactions. For details on trends in recent prior year periods, refer to our 2018 and 2017 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.49Trading and Clearing SegmentThe following presents selected statements of income data for our Trading and Clearing segment (dollars in millions):50(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.

Rates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and due to product mix. In 2019 and 2018, 19% and 20%, respectively, of our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the 51U.S. dollar, our Trading and Clearing segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were lower by $25 million in 2019 from 2018.Our transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $860 million and $844 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in the rebates is due primarily to increased volumes in products with higher rates per contract, an increase in the number of rebate programs offered and an increase in the number of participants within our energy futures and options programs. •Energy Futures and Options Contracts: Total energy volume decreased 3% and revenues increased 3% in 2019 from 2018.–Total oil volume decreased 2% in 2019 from 2018 primarily driven by lower volumes within Brent, partially offset by strength in our Other Crude and Refined Products complex.–Our global natural gas futures and options volume decreased 6% in 2019 from 2018. The volume decrease was primarily due to lower Henry Hub volumes and was partially offset by increased volumes in our European TTF gas contract. The strength in our European TTF gas volumes was driven by the continued emergence of TTF as the European benchmark for natural gas as natural gas continues to globalize.–Emission futures and options volumes increased 2% in 2019 from 2018 driven by higher carbon prices and supply-demand dynamics impacted by regulatory uncertainty.•Agricultural and Metals Futures and Options Contracts: Total volume in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets increased 4% and revenues were flat in 2019 from 2018. The overall increase in agricultural volumes was primarily driven by price volatility resulting from supply and demand dynamics, including weather concerns and geopolitical events.–Sugar futures and options volumes increased 2% in 2019 from 2018.–Other agricultural and metal futures and options volume increased 5% in 2019 from 2018.•Financial Futures and Options Contracts: Total volume and revenues in our financial futures and options markets decreased 11% and 6%, respectively, in 2019 from 2018. –Interest rate futures and options volume and revenue decreased 13% and 15%, respectively, in 2019 from 2018 driven, in part, by a muted European economic backdrop. Interest rate futures and options revenues were $196 million and $230 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.–Other financial futures and options volume, which includes our MSCI®, FTSE® and NYSE FANG+ equity index products, decreased 1% and revenue increased 10% in 2019 from 2018. Other financial futures and options volume decreased due to lower equity market volatility than in the prior year while revenues increased due to strong volumes in our MSCI® complex. Other financial futures and options revenues were $136 million and $124 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.•Cash Equities and Equity Options: Cash equities handled volume was flat in 2019 from 2018. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $203 million and $220 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Equity options volume decreased 6% in 2019 from 2018 due to lower equity market volatility than in the prior year. Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $95 million and $107 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. •Fixed Income and Credit: Fixed income and credit includes revenues from ICE Mortgage Services, ICE Bonds and CDS execution and clearing. Fixed income transaction revenues in 2019 include an increase of $133 million due to acquisitions made in these businesses in late 2018 and 2019.CDS clearing revenues were $132 million and $139 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The notional value of CDS cleared was $14.7 trillion and $16.4 trillion in 2019 and 2018, respectively. CDS clearing revenues decreased in 2019 from 2018 due to lower market volatility, partially offset by record buy-side participation at our U.S. CDS clearing house, ICE Clear Credit, in terms of number of participants and single name notional cleared. 52•OTC and Other Transactions: OTC and other transactions include revenues from our OTC energy business and other trade confirmation services.Other RevenuesOther revenues primarily include interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, technology development fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. The increase in other revenues in 2019 from 2018 is primarily due to increased interest income earned on certain clearing margin deposits reflecting higher balances and increased interest rates, as well as due to the acquisition of Simplifile.Selected Operating DataThe following charts and tables present trading activity in our futures and options markets by commodity type based on the total number of contracts traded, as well as futures and options rate per contract (in millions, except for percentages and rate per contract amounts): Volume and Rate per Contract53 Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change 2018 2017 ChangeNumber of contracts traded (in millions): Energy futures and options 669 692 (3)% 692 685 1%Agricultural and metals futures and options 111 107 4 % 107 94 15%Financial futures and options 630 710 (11)% 710 647 10%Total 1,410 1,509 (7)% 1,509 1,426 6% Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change 2018 2017 ChangeAverage Daily Volume of contracts traded (in thousands): Energy futures and options 2,655 2,747 (3)% 2,747 2,731 1%Agricultural and metals futures and options 442 427 4 % 427 374 14%Financial futures and options 2,460 2,770 (11)% 2,770 2,536 9%Total 5,557 5,944 (7)% 5,944 5,641 5% Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Rate per contract:2019 2018 Change 2018 2017 ChangeEnergy futures and options$1.48 $1.39 6 % $1.39 $1.33 5%Agricultural and metals futures and options$2.25 $2.34 (4)% $2.34 $2.30 2%Financial futures and options$0.52 $0.49 6 % $0.49 $0.49 —%Open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently “open,” – in other words, contracts that have been traded but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange.

Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges.55Transaction-Based Expenses Our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government’s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals and are subject to change. We, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed to equal the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of payment by us may vary from collections. Section 31 fees were $379 million and $357 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the SEC semi-annually as required. The total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was $138 million as of December 31, 2019.We make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges which are included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. Cash liquidity payments, routing and clearing fees were $966 million and $940 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginThe following chart summarizes our Trading and Clearing segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions).

Through ICE Data Services, we generate revenues from a range of global financial and commodity markets, including pricing and reference data, exchange data, analytics, feeds, index services, desktops and connectivity solutions. Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.In 2019 and 2018, 7% and 8%, respectively, of our Data and Listings segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros (all relating to our data services revenues). As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro during 2019, our data services revenues were lower by $9 million in 2019 than in 2018.Data Services RevenuesOur data services revenues are primarily subscription-based and increased 5% in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers and increases in pricing of our products.•Pricing and Analytics: Our pricing and analytics revenues increased 4% in 2019 from 2018. The increase in revenue was due to strength in our pricing and reference data and index businesses driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers and increases in pricing of our products. This growth was partially offset by $5 million of unfavorable fluctuations in the U.S. dollar as compared to the pound sterling and euro. •Exchange Data and Feeds: Our exchange data and feeds revenues increased 5% in 2019 from 2018. The increase in revenue was largely due to strength in our futures exchange data and to a lesser extent cash equities exchange data. The growth was driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers, a larger share of the NMS Plan revenue and increases in pricing of our products.•Desktops and Connectivity: Our desktop and connectivity revenues increased 5% in 2019 from 2018. The increase in revenue was driven primarily by growth in our connectivity services including the ICE Global Network, coupled with stronger desktop revenues.Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. ASV does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. ASV also does not include certain data services revenue streams that are not subscription-based. Revenue from ASV businesses has historically represented approximately 90% of our data revenues. Thus, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues. As of December 31, 2019, ASV was $2.014 billion, which increased 5.5% compared to the ASV as of December 31, 2018. This does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations or impacts of acquisitions.58Listings RevenuesListings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges– original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. All listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges. In addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.In 2019, NYSE and NYSE American raised the most capital globally with approximately $112 billion raised in IPOs and follow-on offerings from over 300 transactions.Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginThe following chart summarizes our Data and Listings segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions).

Due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro, our consolidated operating expenses were $14 million lower in 2019 than in 2018. See Item 7(A) “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information.Compensation and Benefits Expenses Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and individual employee performance. The performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in our number of employees. The below chart summarizes the significant drivers of our compensation and benefits expense results for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except employee headcount). Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 ChangeEmployee headcount 5,989 5,161 16 %Employee severance and retention costs excluding acquisitions$18 $30 (41)%Stock-based compensation expenses$139 $130 7 %Employee headcount and compensation and benefits expenses increased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due the acquisitions of Simplifile in 2019 and CHX Holdings, Inc., the parent company of the Chicago Stock Exchange, or CHX, TMC Bonds and MERS in 2018 and the 2018 launch of Bakkt. Employee headcount also increased due to new employees in our ICE India office, who had previously been our contractors, during the three months ended December 31, 2019. These new businesses resulted in additional compensation and benefits expense of $57 million in 2019 from 2018. Stock-based compensation expenses in the table above relate to employee stock option and restricted stock awards.Professional Services Expenses Professional services expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in consulting and technology services, temporary labor, and regulatory, accounting and legal proceedings. Professional services expenses decreased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to lower consulting service fees on regulatory, accounting, technology and reference data services. This was partially offset by higher legal fees associated with regulatory matters, litigation matters and consulting work related to strategic initiatives.Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration CostsIn 2019, we incurred $2 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily related to professional services costs from our 2019 acquisition of Simplifile and other strategic opportunities.In 2018, we incurred $34 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily relating to employee terminations and lease terminations in connection with our integrations of Interactive Data, Securities Evaluations and Credit Market Analysis, professional services costs from our 2018 acquisitions, and a $5 million banker success fee in connection with our acquisition of TMC Bonds. The integration of Interactive Data was completed by June 30, 2018.We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods.61Technology and Communication Expenses Technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and telecommunications costs.Technology and communications expense also includes fees paid for access to external market data, licensing and other fee agreement expenses, which may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly. Beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we have reflected amounts owed under certain third-party revenue share arrangements as technology and communication operating expenses rather than as had been previously recorded net within transaction and clearing revenues, which resulted in an increase in technology and communications expense of $37 million in 2019 from 2018. Total technology and communications expenses also increased in 2019 from 2018, due to $16 million in costs related to our acquisitions of CHX, TMC Bonds and MERS in 2018 and Simplifile in 2019, and our launch of Bakkt. The increase in 2019 was offset by additional costs related to data migrations, hardware support upgrades and cybersecurity investments of $17 million in 2018.Rent and Occupancy ExpensesRent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in and around Atlanta, New York and London with smaller offices located throughout the world. See Item 2 “- Properties” above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2019 from 2018, primarily due to $5 million in costs related to our 2018 acquisitions of CHX, TMC Bonds, and MERS, our 2019 acquisition of Simplifile and our launch of Bakkt, and increased travel and entertainment and other general and administrative costs, partially offset by the release of non-income tax reserves. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, aircraft, hardware and networking equipment, software, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life. We recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $311 million and $289 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amortization expense increased in 2019 from 2018, as a result of CHX, TMC Bonds and MERS intangible assets, and the $31 million impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore, partially offset by the 2018 $4 million impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets related to our closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada.We recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $320 million and $293 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The increase in 2019 over 2018 was primarily due to depreciation resulting from increased software development and networking equipment.62Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expense) Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change 2018 2017 ChangeOther income (expense): Interest income$35 $22 55 % $22 $8 174 %Interest expense (285) (244) 17 (244) (187) 31Other income, net 58 159 (63) 159 326 (51)Total other income (expense), net $(192) $(63) 203 % $(63) $147 n/a Net income attributable to non-controlling interest $(27) $(32) (17)% $(32) $(28) 12 %Interest IncomeInterest income increased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to a rise in short-term interest rates on various investments, as well as higher cash and restricted cash balances at ICE Clear Europe related to our guaranty fund contributions and increased regulatory capital.Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased in 2019 from 2018 primarily due to an increase in the principal and coupon of our bond refinancing in August 2018, as well as a rise in short-term interest rates impacting our Commercial Paper Program. See “- Debt” below. Other income, netIn connection with our equity investment in Euroclear, we recognized dividend income of $19 million and $15 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, which is included in other income.In September 2019, we recorded promissory note impairment charges of $16 million on work performed by the original plan processor on the CAT. Due to delays and failures in implementation and functionality by the original plan processor, as well as recently-published proposals by the SEC for an amended timeline and implementation structure, we believe the risk that execution venues are not reimbursed has increased, resulting in this impairment.Our equity method investments include the Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, and prior to purchasing the remaining minority stake in MERS in October 2018, our majority investment in MERS. We recognized $62 million and $46 million in equity income as other income related to these investments during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Prior to October 2018, we owned a majority stake in MERS and treated it as an equity method investment because we did not have the ability to control its operations. On October 3, 2018, we completed the purchase of all remaining interests of MERS and recognized a $110 million gain on our initial investment value as other income.We own a 40% interest in the OCC, which is regulated by the SEC and the CFTC. On February 13, 2019, the SEC disapproved the OCC capital plan that was established in 2015. Following the SEC disapproval, the OCC also announced that it will not be providing a refund to clearing members or declaring a dividend to shareholders for the year ended December 31, 2018, which resulted in higher reported OCC 2018 net income than we had estimated. During 2019, we recognized $62 million of equity earnings as our share of estimated OCC profits, including $19 million related to 2018 earnings which was recognized during 2019. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report for additional details on our OCC investment.In connection with our adoption of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-07, Compensation Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, or ASU 2017-07, we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined benefit plans in the income statement as non-operating income on a full retrospective basis. The combined net periodic expense of these plans was $4 million and $8 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively.We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $5 million and $2 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. This was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains 63and losses are recorded in other income, net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables that occur in non-functional currencies due to the increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. See Item 7A “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information on these items.Non-controlling InterestFor consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as non-controlling interests. As of December 31, 2019, our non-controlling interests include those related to the non-ICE limited partners in our CDS clearing subsidiaries and the redeemable non-controlling interests of the non-ICE partners in Bakkt.During September 2018, we purchased a 3.2% interest in a non-ICE limited partner of our CDS clearing subsidiaries, and the remaining non-ICE limited partners hold a 26.7% ownership interest as of December 31, 2019. Refer to Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report.In December 2018, Bakkt Holdings, LLC, or Bakkt, was capitalized with $183 million in initial funding with ICE as the majority owner, along with a group of other minority investors. We hold a call option over these interests subject to certain terms. Similarly, the non-ICE partners in Bakkt hold a put option to require us to repurchase their interests subject to certain terms. These minority interests are reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in temporary equity within our consolidated balance sheet.Consolidated Income Tax Provision Consolidated income tax expense was $521 million and $500 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate was 21% and 20% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 2019 effective tax rate is higher than the 2018 effective tax rate primarily due to the 2018 discrete tax benefits from the acquisition of MERS and the divestiture of Trayport exceeding the net increased tax benefits recorded in 2019 from certain international tax provisions under the TCJA. On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was signed into law. The TCJA enacted broad changes to the U.S. federal income tax code, including reducing the federal corporation income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The reductions in U.S. corporate income tax rates resulted in deferred tax benefits in the period of enactment. The impact of the deferred tax benefits lowered the 2017 effective tax rate by 30% and resulted in a deferred tax benefit of $764 million.See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report, for additional information on these tax items.64Quarterly Results of Operations The following quarterly unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income data has been prepared on substantially the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations for the quarters presented. The historical results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for any future period. This unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly data should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report. The following table sets forth quarterly consolidated statements of income data (in millions): Three Months Ended, December 31, 2019 September 30, 2019 June 30, 2019 March 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 September 30, 2018 June 30, 2018 March 31, 2018Revenues: Energy futures and options contracts$243 $265 $255 $229 $257 $223 $250 $235Agricultural and metals futures and options contracts57 60 72 62 54 58 74 65Financial futures and options contracts80 91 78 83 92 77 94 91Cash equities and equity options442 401 410 390 462 335 389 438Fixed income and credit96 101 80 87 83 56 45 56OTC and other transactions11 11 12 11 13 11 12 13Total transaction and clearing, net929 929 907 862 961 760 864 898Pricing and analytics274 273 270 266 264 263 262 254Exchange data and feeds176 172 180 176 174 168 164 164Desktops and connectivity109 108 103 104 101 99 100 102Total data services559 553 553 546 539 530 526 520Listings113 114 111 111 112 112 111 109Other revenues66 67 63 64 65 61 55 53Total revenues1,667 1,663 1,634 1,583 1,677 1,463 1,556 1,580Transaction-based expenses369 327 336 313 369 263 310 355Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses1,298 1,336 1,298 1,270 1,308 1,200 1,246 1,225Compensation and benefits274 261 259 248 262 251 241 240Professional services28 35 29 33 40 32 29 30Acquisition-related transaction and integration costs1 — 1 — 1 6 15 12Technology and communication123 126 113 107 112 107 108 105Rent and occupancy16 17 18 17 18 17 16 17Selling, general and administrative45 33 41 42 42 37 39 33Depreciation and amortization189 158 157 158 157 148 143 138Total operating expenses676 630 618 605 632 598 591 575Operating income622 706 680 665 676 602 655 650Other income (expense), net (1)(35) (66) (52) (39) 62 (48) (44) (33)Income tax expense134 103 150 134 119 89 149 143Net income$453 $537 $478 $492 $619 $465 $462 $474Net income attributable to non-controlling interest(5) (8) (6) (8) (8) (7) (7) (10)Net income attributable to Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.$448 $529 $472 $484 $611 $458 $455 $464(1) Other income (expense), net for the three months ended December 31, 2018 includes a $110 million gain in connection with our acquisition of MERS.65Liquidity and Capital Resources Below are charts that reflect our capital allocation. The acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received for divestitures, cash paid for equity investments, cash paid for non-controlling interest and redeemable non-controlling interest, and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, in each year.We have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends and the development of our technology platforms. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt, but we may also need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities in the future. See “- Future Capital Requirements” below. See “- Recent Developments” above for a discussion of the acquisitions that we made during 2019. These acquisitions were funded from borrowing under our Commercial Paper Program along with cash flows from operations.Our Commercial Paper Program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. We had net issuances of $360 million under our Commercial Paper Program during 2019.Upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. To mitigate this risk, we maintain an undrawn back-stop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount which meets or exceeds the amount issued under our Commercial Paper Program at any time. If we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the back-stop revolving facility. However, electing to do so would result in higher interest expense. For a discussion of our Commercial Paper Program and other indebtedness, see “- Debt” below.66Consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $841 million and $724 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We had $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was $459 million. Due to U.S. tax reform, the majority of our foreign earnings since January 1, 2018 have been subject to immediate U.S. income taxation, and consequently, the existing non-U.S. unrestricted cash balance can be distributed to the U.S. in the future with no material additional income tax consequences.Our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. We may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities.Repurchases of our common stock may be made from time to time on the open market, through established trading plans, in privately-negotiated transactions or otherwise, in accordance with all applicable securities laws, rules and regulations. In 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 17.4 million shares and 16.3 million shares, respectively, of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively. In 2019, we repurchased 16.1 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $1.4 billion under our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan and 1.3 million shares at a cost of $100 million on the open market. Shares repurchased are held in treasury stock.From time to time, we enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, as authorized by our Board of Directors, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. The timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. In making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, management considers multiple factors, including overall stock market conditions, our common stock price performance, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our Board of Directors, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.In September 2018, our Board of Directors approved an aggregate of $2.0 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective January 1, 2019. In December 2019, our Board of Directors approved an aggregate of $2.4 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective January 1, 2020. The $2.4 billion replaced the previous amount approved by the Board of Directors. We expect this authorization to provide us with capacity for buybacks over six quarters and flexibility to act opportunistically. We expect funding for any share repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program or our debt facilities.We may discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time. The approval of our Board of Directors for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. In addition, our Board of Directors may increase or decrease the amount of capacity we have for repurchases from time to time.67Cash Flow The following table presents the major components of net changes in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions): Year Ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities$2,659 $2,533 $2,085Investing activities(594) (1,755) 92Financing activities(1,753) (463) (1,971)Effect of exchange rate changes 4 (11) 12Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents$316 $304 $218Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items, including depreciation and amortization and the effects of changes in working capital.The $126 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2019 from 2018, is primarily a result of an increase in net income, excluding certain non-cash adjustments such as the 2018 non-cash gain on MERS and the $31 million impairment loss on the ICE Futures Singapore exchange registration intangible asset in 2019. The remaining increase is due to fluctuations in our working capital and the timing of various payments such as transaction-related expenses and taxes.Investing Activities Consolidated net cash provided by (used in) investing activities in 2019 and 2018 relates to cash paid for acquisitions, purchases of investments, proceeds from term deposits, a return of capital related to our investment in OCC, proceeds from investments related to MERS and changes in capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. We paid cash for acquisitions, net of the cash of the companies acquired, of $352 million and $1.2 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively, primarily relating to the Simplifile acquisition during 2019 and the BondPoint, TMC Bonds and MERS acquisitions during 2018. We made cash investments of $306 million during 2018 related to Euroclear and MERS. In 2019, we had a $60 million return of capital related to our equity method investment in the OCC. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report for additional details on our OCC investment.We had capital expenditures of $153 million and $134 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we had capitalized software development expenditures of $152 million and $146 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware and software purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements associated with the new and renovated office spaces in Atlanta, New York, London and India. The software development expenditures primarily relate to the continued development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms, data services and clearing houses.Financing Activities Consolidated net cash used in financing activities in 2019 primarily relates to $1.5 billion in repurchases of common stock, $360 million in net borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program, $621 million in dividend payments to stockholders and $65 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises.Consolidated net cash used in financing activities in 2018 primarily relates to $1.2 billion in repurchases of common stock, $600 million in repayments of our October 2018 Senior Notes, $555 million in dividend payments to our stockholders, $283 million in net repayments under our Commercial Paper Program, and $80 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises, partially offset by $2.2 billion in net proceeds from our Senior Notes issued in 2018 (the September 2023, 2028 and 2048 Senior Notes). See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.Debt As of December 31, 2019, we had $7.8 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of $6.5 billion of senior notes and $1.3 billion under the U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program. The commercial paper notes had 68original maturities ranging from two to 87 days as of December 31, 2019, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.84% per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 22 days. Commercial paper notes of $951 million with original maturities ranging from two to 77 days were outstanding as of December 31, 2018, with a weighted average interest rate of 2.48% per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 12 days.We currently have a $3.4 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as primary administrative agent, issuing lender and swing-line lender, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. As of December 31, 2019, of the $3.4 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the Credit Facility, $1.3 billion is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program and $160 million is required to support certain broker dealer subsidiary commitments. The amount required to backstop the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining $1.9 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.For additional details of our debt instruments, refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.Future Capital Requirements Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our Trading and Clearing and Data and Listings segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases. We currently expect to incur capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between $290 million and $320 million in 2020, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses. In December 2019, our Board of Directors approved an aggregate of $2.4 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective on January 1, 2020. We expect this authorization to provide us with capacity for buybacks over six quarters and flexibility to act opportunistically. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report, for additional details on our stock repurchase plans. Our Board of Directors has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the board or its Audit Committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined net income payout ratio. During 2019, we paid cash dividends of $1.10 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including quarterly dividends of $0.275 per share, for an aggregate payout of $621 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years. For the first quarter of 2020, we announced a $0.30 per share dividend payable on March 31, 2020 to stockholders of record as of March 17, 2020.Other than the facilities for the ICE Clearing Houses, our Credit Facility and our Commercial Paper Program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties. See Notes 10 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements where discussed further. In the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. However, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. See “-Risk Factors"" and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.Non-GAAP Measures We use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent GAAP measures or that supplement the information provided by our GAAP measures. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business 69that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this Annual Report, and believe that these measures, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making period-to-period comparisons of results because the adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.The table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders and adjusted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. These measures, including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts), are as follows:70 Trading and Clearing Segment Data and Listings Segment Consolidated Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses$2,542 $2,420 $2,128 $2,660 $2,559 $2,510 $5,202 $4,979 $4,638Operating expenses1,033 911 781 1,496 1,485 1,478 2,529 2,396 2,259Less: Interactive Data transaction and integration costs and acquisition-related success fees — 6 — — 24 31 — 30 31Less: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles94 73 53 215 214 208 309 287 261Less: Impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore31 — — — — — 31 — —Less: Accruals relating to investigations and inquiries— — 14 — — — — — 14Less: Impairment on divestiture of NYSE Governance Services— — — — — 6 — — 6Less: Impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada— 4 — — — — — 4 —Less: Employee severance costs related to ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada operations— 4 — — — — — 4 —Adjusted operating expenses$908$824$714$1,281$1,247$1,233$2,189$2,071$1,947Operating income$1,509$1,509$1,347$1,164$1,074$1,032$2,673$2,583$2,379Adjusted operating income$1,634$1,596$1,414$1,379$1,312$1,277$3,013$2,908$2,691Operating margin59%62%63%44%42%41%51%52%51%Adjusted operating margin64%66%66%52%51%51%58%58%58% Net income attributable to ICE common stockholders $1,933 $1,988 $2,526Add: Interactive Data transaction and integration costs and acquisition-related success fees —3031Add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles 309287261Add: Impairment of CAT promissory notes 16 — —Add: Impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore 31 — —Less: Gain on acquisition of MERS — (110) —Add: Accruals relating to investigations and inquiries — — 14Add: Impairment on divestiture of NYSE Governance Services — — 6Add: Impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada — 4 —Add: Employee severance costs related to ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada operations — 4 —Add/(Less): Gain on divestiture of Trayport, net — 1 (110)Less: Cetip investment gain, net — — (167)Less: Income tax effect for the above items (90) (98) (43)Less: Deferred tax adjustments from U.S. tax rate reduction — (11) (764)Add/(Less): Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles (8) (5) 10Add/(Less): Other tax adjustments 3 (13) —Adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders $2,194 $2,077 $1,764 Basic earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders $3.44 $3.46 $4.29Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders $3.42 $3.43 $4.25 Adjusted basic earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders $3.91 $3.61 $2.99Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders $3.88 $3.59 $2.97 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 561 575 589Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 565 579 594Acquisition-related transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. However, we adjust for the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to Interactive Data given the magnitude of the $5.6 billion purchase price of this acquisition. The integration of Interactive Data was completed by June 2018. Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-GAAP adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results. 71We include the 2019 impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore as a non-GAAP adjustment. This impairment is not based on our core business operations, but rather was a result of the estimated fair value of an acquired intangible asset falling below its carrying value. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report. We include the 2019 promissory note impairment charges on work performed by the original plan processor on the CAT as a non-GAAP adjustment. This is included as a non-GAAP adjustment as this is not considered a part of our core business operations. See additional discussion on the CAT, above, in Item 1(A) ""-Risk Factors"" in this Annual Report.In addition, we also include the following items as non-GAAP adjustments, as each of these are not considered a part of our core business operations:•2018: the gain recognized on our initial majority investment in MERS in connection with our acquisition of 100% of the remaining MERS interests;•2018: the impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets and employee severance costs related to the closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada; •2017: the net gain on the divestiture of Trayport, and in 2018, a subsequent adjustment to reduce of the gain on the divestiture;•2017: the realized investment gain and the foreign exchange loss and transaction expenses on the sale of our investment in Cetip;•2017: accruals relating to investigations and inquiries; and•2017: the NYSE Governance Services net impairment loss on its divestiture.The tax items in non-GAAP adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments or tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance. The following tax-related items are included as non-GAAP adjustments:•The income tax effects relating to all non-GAAP adjustments;•Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles, including the impact of U.S. state tax law changes and apportionment updates, as well as foreign tax law changes which resulted in deferred tax (benefit) expense of ($8 million), ($5 million) and $10 million in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively;•Deferred tax benefits of $11 million and $764 million in 2018 and 2017, respectively, resulting from changes in estimates as a result of the enactment of the TCJA which reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; and•Other tax adjustments of $3 million in 2019 for additional audit settlement payments primarily related to pre-acquisition tax matters in conjunction with our acquisition of NYSE in 2013; and other tax adjustments in 2018 including a $17 million tax benefit on the sale of Trayport, partially offset by an audit settlement for a pre-acquisition period in connection with our acquisition of NYSE in 2013.For additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and “- Recent Developments,” “- Consolidated Operating Expenses”, “- Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” and “-Consolidated Income Tax Provision” above.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As described in Notes 3 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, certain clearing house collateral and Bakkt custodial assets are reported off-balance sheet. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. 72Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following presents our contractual obligations (which we intend to fund from existing cash as well as cash flow from operations) and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2019 (in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Less Than 1 Year 1-3 Years 4-5 Years After 5 YearsContractual Obligations: Short-term and long-term debt and interest $10,265 $2,794 $891 $1,522 $5,058Operating lease obligations 376 62 128 86 100Purchase obligations263 187 71 5 —Total contractual cash obligations $10,904 $3,043 $1,090 $1,613 $5,158Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.We have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments listed above $65.0 billion in cash margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable. Clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. The cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ICE NGX administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. It has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physically-settled contract, each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable. We have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or UTBs. As of December 31, 2019, our cumulative UTBs were $103 million, and interest and penalties related to UTBs were $33 million. We are under examination by various tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. It is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our UTBs. As of December 31, 2019, we, through NYSE, have net obligations of $150 million related to our pension and other benefit programs. The date of payment under these net obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs. In addition, the future funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT is ultimately expected to be provided by both the SROs and broker-dealers. To date, however, funding has been provided solely by the SROs, and future funding is expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the SEC and subsequently collected by industry members. See ""- Non-GAAP Measures"" above. New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 73Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and re-evaluate them on a periodic basis. Based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. The values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets, including identified intangible assets. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, trademarks, technology, trading products, data, exchange registrations, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments and estimates may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not. In performing the allocation of the acquisitions' purchase price to assets and liabilities, we consider, among other factors, the intended use of the acquired assets, analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. At the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. We continue to review and assess our estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by GAAP, which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Estimation uncertainty may exist due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of an acquired business in our discounted cash flow models. Significant assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and expense synergies that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate.Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, and we have identified four reporting units: our Futures reporting unit, our Data and Listings reporting unit, our Cash Equities reporting unit, and our Fixed Income and Credit reporting unit. These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. Goodwill impairment testing consists of a two-step methodology. The initial step requires us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value, including goodwill and other intangible assets, of such reporting unit. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, no impairment loss is recognized and the second step, which is a calculation of the impairment, is not performed. However, if the carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recorded equal to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value. For annual goodwill impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, including goodwill and other intangible assets. If we conclude that this is the case, we must perform the two-step methodology described above. Otherwise, no further testing is required. For annual indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment testing, we also have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than its carrying amount. For our goodwill impairment testing, we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach. For our testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches.74Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. These estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. During 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $31 million on the remaining value of exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore as a result of a decrease in fair value determined during our annual impairment testing.We are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. If an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. Fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., U.K. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, or SAB 118, provided guidance for companies that had not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. As of December 31, 2018, we had completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the TCJA. We reaffirmed our position that we were not subject to transition tax under the TCJA as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we concluded that the $764 million of deferred tax benefit recorded in the 2017 financial statements was a reasonable estimate of the TCJA’s impact on our deferred tax and no further adjustments are necessary. The FASB Staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. We have completed our analysis of the effects of these provisions and have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred.We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.We operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. 75We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. ITEM 7 (A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments were $2.2 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of which $282 million and $275 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or Canadian dollars, and the remaining amounts are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in short-term interest rates would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $15 million as of December 31, 2019, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2019, we had $7.8 billion in outstanding debt, of which $6.5 billion relates to our senior notes, which bear interest at fixed interest rates. The remaining amount outstanding of $1.3 billion relates to our Commercial Paper Program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk, and a subsidiary line of credit. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2019 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $13 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. The interest rates on our Commercial Paper Program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. The weighted average interest rate on our Commercial Paper Program decreased from 2.48% as of December 31, 2018 to 1.84% as of December 31, 2019. The decrease in the Commercial Paper Program weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the decisions by the U.S. Federal Reserve to decrease the federal funds short-term interest rate by 25 basis points in each of July, September and October of 2019. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in short-term interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk As an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling, Canadian dollars or euros, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. Certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. Our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2019 and 2018 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates): 76 Year Ended December 31, 2019 Year Ended December 31, 2018 Pound Sterling Euro Pound Sterling EuroAverage exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the current year period$1.2769 $1.1195 $1.3356 $1.1813Average exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the same period in the prior year$1.3356 $1.1813 $1.2890 $1.1297Average exchange rate increase (decrease)(4)% (5)% 4% 5%Foreign denominated percentage of: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses8 % 5 % 9% 5%Operating expenses10 % 2 % 11% 2%Operating income7 % 8 % 7% 7%Impact of the currency fluctuations (1) on: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses$(19) $(15) $16 $10Operating expenses$(11) $(3) $9 $2Operating income$(8) $(12) $7 $8(1)Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.We have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. In 2019 and 2018, 13% and 14%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and 12% and 13%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables occurs through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $5 million and $2 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The foreign currency transaction losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. A 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2019, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity, would result in a foreign currency loss of $2 million.We entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2019 and 2018 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. Although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities. We have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. Our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): As of December 31, 2019 Position in pounds sterling Position in Canadian dollars Position in eurosAssets£805 C$1,583 €151 of which goodwill represents613 408 92Liabilities91 1,178 45Net currency position£714 C$405 €106Net currency position, in $USD$947 $312 $118Negative impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates$95 $31 $12Foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within our balance sheet. See the table below for the portion of equity attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments 77as well as the activity by year included within our statement of other comprehensive income. The impact of the foreign currency exchange rate differences in the table below were primarily driven by fluctuations of the pound sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar which were 1.3260, 1.2756 and 1.3510 as of December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments, monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests. Clearing House Cash Deposit RisksThe ICE Clearing Houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. Refer to Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ICE Clearing Houses' cash and cash equivalent deposits, which were $65.0 billion as of December 31, 2019. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the ICE Clearing Houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the clearing members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated:•Credit Risk: When a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. Credit risk is managed by using exposure limits depending on the credit profile of the counterparty as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. Our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. We seek to substantially mitigate the credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.•Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and at the right time. To mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.•Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value. Our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments. For example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated 78maturities. In addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, U.S. Treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (Euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities. •Security Issuer Risk: Security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments. •Investment Counterparty Risk: Investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers. When engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house control. Additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. The typical haircut for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount which provides additional excess collateral. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty’s obligation.The ICE Clearing Houses may use third-party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house. Such advisors do not hold clearing member cash or cash equivalent deposits or the underlying investments. Clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians including JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., Citibank N.A., BNY Mellon, BMO Harris N.A. and Euroclear Bank Brussels (for non-U.S. dollar deposits). The ICE Clearing Houses employ (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives. •Cross-Currency Margin Deposit Risk: Each of the ICE Clearing Houses may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in U.S. dollars to secure a Euro margin obligation). The ICE Clearing Houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility. Cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.Impact of Inflation We have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. In the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.79",2023-12-30 20:40:28.528521
1571949,ICE,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.",2021,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 6, 2020. 47Overview We are a provider of marketplace infrastructure, data services and technology solutions to a broad range of customers including financial institutions, corporations and government entities. These products, which span major asset classes including futures, equities, fixed income and U.S. residential mortgages, provide our customers with access to mission critical workflow tools that are designed to increase asset class transparency and workflow efficiency. We report our results in three segments: Exchanges, Fixed Income and Data Services, and Mortgage Technology. The majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S. and U.K.•In our Exchanges segment, we operate regulated marketplaces for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities. Much of the revenue reported in the Exchanges segment was previously reported in our Trading & Clearing segment. However, data services revenues and listings revenues, which are now reported in the Exchanges segment, were previously reported in our Data & Listings segment.•In our Fixed Income and Data Services segment, we provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices and execution services as well as global CDS clearing and multi-asset class data delivery solutions. Our CDS Clearing and ICE Bonds transaction revenue was previously reported in our Trading & Clearing segment, while all of our Fixed Income Data & Analytics and Other Data & Network Services revenues were reported in our Data & Listings segment.•In our Mortgage Technology segment, we provide an end-to-end technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to address the inefficiencies that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market. Prior to the re-alignment of our business, ICE Mortgage Technology was reported in our Trading & Clearing segment.Recent Developments COVID-19The coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions globally and has led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease, including travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, and to take actions designed to stabilize markets and promote economic growth. From an operational perspective, our businesses, including our exchanges, clearing houses, listing venues, data services businesses, and mortgage platforms, have remained open and we do not have any plans to close any of our business operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken preventative measures and implemented contingency plans, and currently most of our employees are working remotely. In response to government mandates, we closed all of our office facilities between early March and late April 2020, with only our operationally essential employees working on-site at our facilities for business continuity purposes. As various governments began easing orders requiring office closures in late April, we began a phased re-opening of certain of our office facilities allowing a limited number of operationally non-essential workers to also work on-site. These measures are in compliance, as necessary, with local government directives and social distancing directives. We continue to monitor local government mandates in determining our office re-openings, re-closures and work-related travel.Global health concerns relating to COVID-19 and preventive measures taken to reduce its spread have created significant volatility in financial markets, which has resulted in higher trading volumes for some of our products and increased demand for our services. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business will depend largely on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the distribution, public acceptance and widespread use and effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain the spread of the disease or mitigate its impact. We continue to monitor this dynamic situation, including guidance and regulations issued by U.S. and other governmental authorities. In light of the continually evolving nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate effect of the pandemic on our business, results of operations or financial condition in the future. Acquisition of Ellie MaeOn September 4, 2020, we acquired Ellie Mae for aggregate consideration of $11.4 billion from private equity firm Thoma Bravo. Ellie Mae is a cloud-based technology solution provider for the mortgage finance industry. Through its digital lending platform, Ellie Mae provides technology solutions to participants in the mortgage supply chain, including over 483,000 customers and thousands of partners and investors who participate on its open network. Originators rely on Ellie Mae to securely manage the exchange of data across the mortgage ecosystem to enable the origination of mortgages while adhering to various local, state and federal compliance requirements. Ellie Mae is a part of our ICE Mortgage Technology business and is included in our Mortgage Technology segment. From the acquisition date through December 31, 2020, Ellie Mae revenues of $351 million and operating expenses of $250 million were recorded for the year ended December 31, 2020, which are reflected in our mortgage technology revenues and operating expenses, respectively.The purchase price consisted of $9.5 billion in cash, as adjusted for $335 million of cash and cash equivalents held by Ellie Mae on the date of acquisition, and approximately $1.9 billion, or approximately 18.4 million shares of our common stock, based on our stock price on the acquisition date. ICE funded the cash portion of the purchase price with net proceeds from our offering of new senior notes in August 2020, together with the issuance of commercial paper and borrowings under a new senior unsecured term loan facility.Acquisition of Bridge2 SolutionsOn February 21, 2020, our Bakkt subsidiary acquired Bridge2 Solutions, a leading provider of loyalty solutions for merchants and consumers. Bridge2 Solutions enables some of the world’s leading brands to engage customers and drive loyalty. It powers incentive and employee perk programs for companies across a wide spectrum of industries.Bakkt TransactionAdditionally, on January 11, 2021, Bakkt, our majority-owned indirect subsidiary, entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger, or the Merger Agreement, to combine with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings, or VIH, a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by Victory Park Capital. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, VIH plans to domesticate and become a Delaware corporation (the “Domestication”) and be renamed “Bakkt Holdings, Inc.” (“Bakkt Pubco”) and, following the Domestication, a subsidiary of VIH plans to merge with and into Bakkt (the “Merger”), with Bakkt surviving the Merger. Upon the consummation of the Merger (the “Closing”), Bakkt Pubco plans to be organized in an “Up-C” structure in which substantially all of the assets and the business of Bakkt Pubco will be held by Bakkt and its subsidiaries, and Bakkt Pubco’s only direct assets will consist of its membership interests in Bakkt. Upon the Closing, Bakkt Pubco is expected to have a class of common stock listed on the New York Stock Exchange.Also on January 11, 2021, concurrently with the execution of the Merger Agreement, VIH entered into subscription agreements with certain investors (collectively, the “PIPE Investors”), pursuant to which, and on the terms and subject to the conditions of which, the PIPE Investors have collectively subscribed for additional equity in Bakkt Pubco for an aggregate purchase price equal to $325 million (the “PIPE Investment”). The PIPE Investors include ICE, and we committed to purchase additional equity in Bakkt Pubco that would comprise up to $50 million of the PIPE Investment. The PIPE Investment will be consummated immediately prior to the Closing.As part of the transaction, Bakkt’s existing equity holders and management will roll 100% of their equity into the combined company. Assuming no shareholders of VIH exercise their redemption rights, current Bakkt equity holders, including ICE, will own approximately 78% of the combined company, VIH’s public shareholders will own approximately 8%, VPC will own 2%, and PIPE investors (a group that will also include us) will own approximately 12% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the combined company at closing; ICE is expected to have a 65% economic interest in the combined company at the Closing, which is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2021. The proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval of VIH’s shareholders and certain regulatory approvals. At the Closing, ICE, which is expected to own a majority of the common stock of the Bakkt Pubco immediately following the Merger, will enter into a voting agreement with Bakkt Pubco (the “Voting Agreement”). Pursuant to the Voting Agreement, for so long as we own at least 50% of the total voting power of Bakkt Pubco common stock, we will agree to vote on any matter submitted to a vote or consent of the stockholders of Bakkt Pubco any shares of common stock of Bakkt Pubco owned by us in excess of 30% of the outstanding voting power of Bakkt Pubco, in the same percentages, for and against the relevant matter, as votes are cast by all stockholders of Bakkt Pubco other than ICE. As a consequence of the Voting Agreement and Bakkt Pubco’s other governance arrangements, following the Closing, we expect to reclassify Bakkt Pubco as our equity method investment and Bakkt will therefore cease to be consolidated with our financial statements.Consolidated Financial HighlightsThe following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts): 49Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,20202019Change20192018ChangeRevenues, less transaction-based expenses $6,036 $5,202 16 %$5,202 $4,979 4 %Operating expenses $3,003 $2,529 19 %$2,529 $2,396 6 %Adjusted operating expenses(1)$2,495 $2,189 14 %$2,189 $2,071 6 %Operating income $3,033 $2,673 13 %$2,673 $2,583 3 %Adjusted operating income(1)$3,541 $3,013 18 %$3,013 $2,908 4 %Operating margin 50 %51 %(1 pt)51 %52 %(1 pt)Adjusted operating margin(1)59 %58 %1 pt58 %58 %— Other income (expense), net $(267)$(192)39 %$(192)$(63)203 %Income tax expense (benefit)$658 $521 26 %$521 $500 4 %Effective tax rate 24 %21 %3 pts21 %20 %1 ptNet income attributable to ICE$2,089 $1,933 8 %$1,933 $1,988 (3)%Adjusted net income attributable to ICE(1)$2,500 $2,194 14 %$2,194 $2,077 6 %Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$3.77 $3.42 10 %$3.42 $3.43 — %Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders(1)$4.51 $3.88 16 %$3.88 $3.59 8 %Cash flows from operating activities$2,881 $2,659 8 %$2,659 $2,533 5 %(1) The adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance.

The increase in revenues includes $34 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2019 from 2018. •Operating expenses increased $474 million in 2020 from 2019. The increase in operating expenses includes $2 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2020 from 2019.•Operating expenses increased $133 million in 2019 from 2018. The increase in operating expenses includes $14 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2019 from 2018.•In connection with our acquisition of MERS, we recorded a $110 million gain in other income during 2018.•The effective tax rate in 2020 is higher than the effective tax rate in 2019 primarily due to U.K. tax law changes enacted in July 2020, partially offset by favorable state apportionment changes as a result of our acquisition of Ellie Mae, as well as favorable changes in certain international tax provisions as part of the U.S. Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, in 2019.•The effective tax rate in 2019 was higher than the effective tax rate in 2018 primarily due to the 2018 discrete tax benefits from the acquisition of MERS and the divestiture of Trayport exceeding the net increased tax benefits recorded in 2019 from certain international tax provisions under the TCJA.Business Environment and Market TrendsOur business environment has been characterized by:•globalization of marketplaces, customers and competitors;•growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation; •commodity, interest rate and financial markets uncertainty;•growing demand for data to inform customers' risk management and investment decisions;•evolving, increasing and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions;•price volatility increasing customers' demand for risk management services;•increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies;•customers' preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity;•the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements;•rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; and•consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.Recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several non-U.S. regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” included in this Annual Report, Brexit, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of non-transaction and clearing revenues from 34% in 2014 to 48% in 2020. This non-transaction revenue includes data services, listings and various mortgage technology solutions.Many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: 51•increasing global regulatory demands; •greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; •greater emphasis on risk management; •market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; •the move to passive investing and indexation; •ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; •increased automation of fixed income and other less automated markets; •the development of new data products; •the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; •new entrants; and •increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, and prudently manage expenses, in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, markets and technology solutions.Segment Results We previously operated as two reportable business segments, but effective October 1, 2020, we realigned our businesses as part of a review of, and changes in, our organizational structure following our acquisition of Ellie Mae. As a result, we changed our internal financial reporting and determined that a change in reportable segments had occurred. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change. Our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.As of December 31, 2020, our business is conducted through three reportable business segments, comprised of the following: •Our Exchanges segment includes our trade execution and clearing within our global futures network and NYSE businesses, various data and connectivity services that are directly related to those exchange platforms, administration fees and our NYSE listings business. Trade execution and clearing products include energy, agricultural and metals, financial futures and options, cash equities, equity options, OTC and other; •Our Fixed Income and Data Services segment includes trade execution and clearing within our ICE Bonds and CDS businesses, pricing and reference data, analytics, indices, consolidated feeds and our ICE Global Network businesses; and•Our Mortgage Technology segment includes our MERS, Simplifile and Ellie Mae mortgage services businesses. This segment includes origination technology, network and closing solutions, data and analytics, registrations and other.While revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. We directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. Otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments. Our October 1, 2020 change in business segment presentation triggered a reallocation of our segment operating expenses. Prior periods have been adjusted to reflect this change.For details on trends in recent prior year periods, refer to our 2019 and 2018 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.52Exchanges SegmentThe following presents selected statements of income data for our Exchanges segment (dollars in millions):(1) The adjusted numbers in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Transaction and clearing revenues consist of fees collected from derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing, and are reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below. Rates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and product mix. Our data and connectivity services revenues are recurring subscription fees related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. Our listings revenues are also recurring subscription fees that we earn for the provision of NYSE listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.In both 2020 and 2019, 14% of our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar, our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were higher by $4 million in 2020 from 2019.Our exchange transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $962 million and $855 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in the rebates is due primarily to increased volumes in products with higher rates per contract, an increase in the number of rebate programs offered and an increase in the number of participants within our energy futures and options programs. •Energy Futures and Options: Total energy volume increased 15% and revenues increased 13% in 2020 from 2019.–Total oil volume increased 13% in 2020 from 2019 due to increased risk management activity driven by shifting supply/demand dynamics related to various geopolitical events and the emergence of COVID-19.–Our global natural gas futures and options volume increased 22% in 2020 from 2019. The volume increase in our North American natural gas products was primarily driven by shifting supply/demand dynamics related to lower levels of U.S. shale production and increased demand for natural gas. In addition, the strength in our European TTF gas volumes was driven by the continued emergence of TTF as not only the European benchmark, but also the emerging global benchmark, for natural gas as the commodity continues to globalize.54•Agricultural and Metals Futures and Options: Total volume in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets decreased 3% and revenues decreased 2% in 2020 from 2019. The overall decrease in agricultural volumes was primarily driven by lower commodity price volatility than the prior year.–Sugar futures and options volumes increased 6% in 2020 from 2019, driven by shifting supply/demand dynamics coupled with increased price volatility. –Other agricultural and metal futures and options volume decreased 9% in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to lower cocoa volumes driven by geopolitical uncertainty. •Financial Futures and Options: Total volume decreased 2% and revenues increased 8% in our financial futures and options markets in 2020 from 2019. –Interest rate futures and options volume and revenue decreased 5% and 1% in 2020 from 2019, respectively, due to the impact of quantitative easing measures implemented by major central banks in response to COVID-19. Interest rate futures and options revenues were $193 million and $196 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.–Other financial futures and options volume, which includes our MSCI®, FTSE® and NYSE FANG+ equity index products, increased 12% and revenue increased 20% in 2020 from 2019. Other financial futures and options volume increased due to increased equity market volatility driven by accelerating adoption of MSCI® index futures and options as well as uncertainty related to COVID-19. Other financial futures and options revenues were $164 million and $136 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.•Cash Equities and Equity Options: Cash equities volume increased 42% in 2020 from 2019 due to heightened volatility driven by uncertainty related to COVID-19 and various geopolitical events. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $276 million and $203 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Equity options volume increased 61% in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to higher industry volumes and heightened volatility driven by uncertainty related to COVID-19 and various geopolitical events. Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $101 million and $95 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. •OTC and Other: OTC and other transactions include revenues from our OTC energy business and other trade confirmation services, as well as interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. Our OTC and other transaction revenues increased 27% in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to increased income earned on certain clearing margin deposits reflecting higher balances and increased regulatory fees.•Data and Connectivity Services: Our data and connectivity services revenues increased 5% in 2020 from 2019. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers and increased purchases by existing customers.•Listings Revenues: Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies. Listings revenues decreased 1% in 2020 from 2019, driven by market volatility causing IPO delays as well as de-listings, partially offset by a rebound in IPO activity towards the end of 2020. Listings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges– original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. All listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges. In addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.In 2020, NYSE and NYSE American raised the most capital globally with approximately $185 billion raised in IPOs and follow-on offerings from over 435 transactions, an increase of 65% from $112 billion raised in 2019.55Selected Operating DataThe following charts and tables present trading activity in our futures and options markets by commodity type based on the total number of contracts traded, as well as futures and options rate per contract (in millions, except for percentages and rate per contract amounts):Volume and Rate per ContractYear Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,20202019Change20192018ChangeNumber of contracts traded (in millions):Energy futures and options 773 669 15 %669 692 (3)% Agricultural and metals futures and options 108 111 (3)%111 107 4 %Financial futures and options 619 630 (2)%630 710 (11)%Total 1,500 1,410 6 %1,410 1,509 (7)%Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,20202019Change20192018ChangeAverage Daily Volume of contracts traded (in thousands):Energy futures and options 3,054 2,655 15 %2,655 2,747 (3)% Agricultural and metals futures and options 428 442 (3)%442 427 4 %Financial futures and options 2,409 2,460 (2)%2,460 2,770 (11)%Total 5,891 5,557 6 %5,557 5,944 (7)%Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,Rate per contract:20202019Change20192018ChangeEnergy futures and options$1.45 $1.48 (2)%$1.48 $1.39 6 %Agricultural and metals futures and options$2.27 $2.25 1 %$2.25 $2.34 (4)%Financial futures and options$0.57 $0.52 10 %$0.52 $0.49 6 %56Open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently “open,” – in other words, contracts that have been entered into but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange.

Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges.Transaction-Based Expenses Our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government’s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals and are subject to change. We, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed to equal the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of 58payment by us will vary from collections. Section 31 fees were $622 million and $379 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the SEC semi-annually as required. The total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was $207 million as of December 31, 2020.We make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges which are included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. Cash liquidity payments, routing and clearing fees were $1.6 billion and $966 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginThe following chart summarizes our Exchanges segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions).

In 2020 and 2019, 14% and 13%, respectively, of our Fixed Income and Data Services segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar during 2020, our fixed income and data services revenues were higher by $3 million in 2020 than in 2019.Fixed Income and Data Services RevenuesOur fixed income and data services revenues increased 3% in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to growth in our fixed income data and analytics products, our other data and network services and strong cleared volumes within our CDS clearing business.•Fixed Income Execution: Fixed income execution includes revenues from ICE Bonds. Execution fees are reported net of rebates, which were nominal in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Our fixed income execution revenues decreased 15% in 2020 from 2019. The decrease in revenue was driven by decreased retail activity as a result of low interest rates, particularly municipal and corporate bond activity.•CDS Clearing: CDS clearing revenues decreased 2% in 2020 from 2019. The notional value of CDS cleared was $17.9 trillion and $14.7 trillion in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Despite record clearing activity in 2020 from both dealers and clients driven by heightened market volatility, revenue decreased as a result of lower interest earned on collateral balances held at the clearing house due to lower 2020 Fed Funds rates.•Fixed Income Data and Analytics: Our fixed income data and analytics revenues increased 5% in 2020 from 2019. The increase in revenue was due to strength in our index business and continued growth in our pricing and reference data business driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, increased purchases by existing customers and increases in pricing of our products.•Other Data and Network Services: Our other data and network services revenues increased 5% in 2020 from 2019. The increase in revenues was driven primarily through growth in our ICE Global Network offering, coupled with strength in our consolidated feeds and stronger desktop revenues.Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues, which includes Fixed Income Data and Analytics as well as Other Data and Network Services, subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. ASV does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. However, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues.61As of December 31, 2020, ASV was $1.569 billion, which increased 6.4% compared to the ASV as of December 31, 2019. ASV represents nearly 100% of total data services revenues for this segment. This does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations or impacts of acquisitions.Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginThe following chart summarizes our Fixed Income and Data Services segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions).

Our mortgage technology business enables greater workflow efficiency for customers focused on originating U.S. residential mortgage loans. Mortgage technology revenues increased $456 million or 324% in 2020 from 2019. Revenues from Ellie Mae following our September 2020 acquisition were $351 million and revenues from Simplifile following our June 2019 acquisition were $95 million and $37 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. •Origination technology: Our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage transaction, automating the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information and enabling automated enforcement of rules and business practices designed to help ensure that each completed loan transaction is of high quality and adheres to secondary market standards. Revenue from origination technology is based on recurring SaaS subscription fees, with an additive Success-Based Pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription. •Network and closing solutions: Our network and closing solutions provide customers connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure exchange of information between our customers and a broad ecosystem of third-party service providers, as well as lenders and investors that are critical to consummating the millions of loan transactions that occur on our origination network each year. Our closing network uniquely connects key participants, such as lenders, title and settlement agents and individual county recorders, to digitize the traditionally manual and paper-based closing and recording process. Revenues from network and closing solutions are based largely on the number of applications and closed loans that utilize the various services.•Data and Analytics: Revenues include those related to ICE Mortgage Technology’s AIQ offering, which applies machine learning and artificial intelligence, or AI, to the entire loan origination process, offering customers greater efficiency by streamlining data collection and validation through our automated document recognition and data extraction capabilities. AIQ revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature. In addition, our data offerings include real-time industry and peer benchmarking tools, which provide originators a granular view into the real-time trends of nearly half the U.S. residential mortgage market. We also provide a Data as a Service (DaaS) offering through private data clouds for lenders to access their own data and origination information. Revenues related to our data products are largely subscription-based and recurring in nature.•Registrations and other: Revenues are related to the MERS database, a leading system of record for recording and tracking changes in mortgage servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in loans secured by U.S. residential real estate; these revenues are transaction-based. Other revenues include professional services fees, as well as revenues from ancillary products.The following chart summarizes our Mortgage Technology segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions). See “- Consolidated Operating Expenses” below for a discussion of the significant changes in our operating expenses.64Mortgage Technology Segment:Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,20202019Change20192018ChangeOperating expenses $443 $72 510 %$72 $17 313 %Adjusted operating expenses(1)$231 $56 306 %$56 $14 291 %Operating income $152 $67 124 %$67 $5 1,427 %Adjusted operating income(1)$364 $83 337 %$83 $8 1,024 %Operating margin 25 %48 %(23 pts)48 %20 %28 ptsAdjusted operating margin(1)61 %59 %2 pts59 %34 %25 pts(1) The adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance.

Due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro, our consolidated operating expenses were $2 million higher in 2020 than in 2019. See Item 7(A) “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information.Compensation and Benefits Expenses Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and individual employee performance. The performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in our number of employees. The below chart summarizes the significant drivers of our compensation and benefits expense results for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except employee headcount).Year Ended December 31,20202019ChangeEmployee headcount 8,890 5,989 48 %Stock-based compensation expenses$127 $139 (9)%Employee headcount increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to new employees at Ellie Mae and Bridge2 Solutions. These businesses, as well as additional expenses related to Simplifile and growth of our ICE India office, resulted in additional compensation and benefits expense of $113 million in 2020 from 2019. In addition, compensation and benefits expense increased $31 million in 2020 from 2019 as a result of other increases in employee headcount, 2020 merit pay and our 2020 adjustment of our employee cash bonus and non-cash performance-based restricted shares to above-target levels based on our 2020 financial performance metrics. Further, employee taxes and benefits expenses were higher in 2020 primarily due to increased employee insurance costs, partially offset by decreased employee severance expense in 2020 from 2019. The stock-based compensation expenses in the table above relate to employee stock option and restricted stock awards.Professional Services Expenses Professional services expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in our use of these services in our business. Professional services expenses increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to increased costs associated with regulatory and litigation matters and $13 million in additional consulting expenses related to our acquisitions of Ellie Mae and Bridge2 Solutions.Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration CostsIn 2020, we incurred $105 million in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, primarily related to our acquisitions of Ellie Mae and Bridge2 Solutions. The Bridge2 Solutions acquisition costs include $10 million of expenses resulting from a Bakkt incentive award market condition estimation adjustment that was directly related to the March 2020 capital call to fund the acquisition of Bridge2 Solutions. We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods.67Technology and Communication Expenses Technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and telecommunications costs.Technology and communications expense also includes fees paid for access to external market data, licensing and other fee agreement expenses. Technology and communications expenses may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly. Beginning in the second quarter of 2019, we have reflected amounts owed under certain third-party revenue share arrangements as technology and communication operating expenses rather than as had been previously recorded net within transaction and clearing revenues, which resulted in an increase in technology and communications expense of $14 million in 2020 from 2019. Technology and communications expenses also increased by $21 million in 2020 from 2019, due to increased third-party revenue share fees. In addition, technology and communications expenses increased by $43 million in 2020 from 2019 due to our acquisitions of Ellie Mae and Bridge2 Solutions in 2020 and Simplifile in 2019, partially offset by lower data services costs.Rent and Occupancy ExpensesRent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in and around Atlanta, New York, Pleasanton, London and Hyderabad with smaller offices located throughout the world. Rent and occupancy expenses increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to $6 million related to our acquisitions of Ellie Mae and Bridge2 Solutions, and $5 million combined costs for the early termination of our NYSE Chicago office lease and costs of our ICE India office. See Item 2 “- Properties” above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to a $10 million charitable contribution in support of COVID-19 relief efforts, $8 million in accruals for a regulatory settlement, $6 million in increased costs related to our acquisition of Ellie Mae and increased marketing and bad debt expenses, partially offset by lower travel expenses due to COVID-19. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, aircraft, hardware and networking equipment, software, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life. We recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $388 million and $311 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, 2019 amortization expense included a $31 million impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore. Amortization expense increased in 2020 from 2019, primarily due to $104 million in amortization expenses recorded on the Ellie Mae intangible assets following our acquisition, partially offset by certain Interactive Data intangible assets that became fully amortized in the fourth quarter of 2019.We recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $363 million and $320 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in 2020 over 2019 was primarily due to depreciation resulting from increased software development and networking equipment and due to $8 million in additional expenses related to our September 2020 acquisition of Ellie Mae. In addition, our 2020 depreciation expense included a software impairment charge of $11 million related to a portion of customized software developed at Bakkt that is no longer useful.68Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expense) Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,20202019Change20192018ChangeOther income (expense):Interest income$10 $35 (71)%$35 $22 55 %Interest expense (357)(285)25 (285)(244)17 Other income (expense), net 80 58 38 58 159 (63)Total other income (expense), net $(267)$(192)39 %$(192)$(63)203 %Net income attributable to non-controlling interest $(19)$(27)(27)%$(27)$(32)(17)%Interest IncomeInterest income decreased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to a decrease in short-term interest rates on various investments.Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased in 2020 from 2019 primarily due to the issuance of new senior notes in the May 2020 refinancing and in August 2020 related to the Ellie Mae acquisition. Our fixed rate senior notes outstanding increased by $7.6 billion in 2020 from 2019. In 2020, interest expense included a $14 million extinguishment payment incurred related to the June 2020 early redemption of senior notes with an original maturity of December 1, 2020 and $5 million in pre-acquisition interest expense related to the Ellie Mae transaction. See “- Debt” below. Other income (expense), netWe have an equity method investment in the Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, and we recognized $71 million and $62 million in equity income as other income related to this investment during 2020 and 2019, respectively. We own a 40% interest in the OCC, which is regulated by the SEC and the CFTC. Included within the amount recognized during 2019 is a positive earnings adjustment of $19 million to reflect higher reported OCC 2018 net income than originally estimated, due to the SEC's disapproval of the OCC capital plan that was established in 2015. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report for additional details on our OCC investment.In connection with our equity investment in Euroclear, we recognized dividend income of $19 million in 2019, which is included in other income. As a result of a 2020 European regulation limiting dividend payments, we did not receive a Euroclear dividend in 2020. In addition, in November 2020, we became aware of an observable price change in an orderly transaction of a similar Euroclear investment by a third party. The transaction resulted in a fair value adjustment of our Euroclear investment, and we recorded a gain of $35 million in other income, which includes the impact of foreign currency exchange.We historically held a 9% ownership interest in BIDS, a registered broker-dealer and the operator of the BIDS Alternative Trading System. In December 2020, we sold our investment in BIDS to Cboe and recorded a gain on the sale of $20 million, included in other income.In 2020, we recorded an accrual for potential legal settlements of $30 million.We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $5 million in both 2020 and 2019. This was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables occur in non-functional currencies and there is an increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. See Item 7A “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information on these items.In 2019, we recorded promissory note impairment charges of $16 million on work performed by the original plan processor on the CAT, and in 2020, we recorded an additional $2 million. Due to delays and failures in implementation and functionality by the original plan processor, as well as recently-published proposals by the SEC for an amended timeline 69and implementation structure, we believe the risk that execution venues are not reimbursed has increased, resulting in this impairment.In connection with our adoption of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-07, Compensation Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, or ASU 2017-07, we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined benefit plans in the income statement as non-operating income on a full retrospective basis. The combined net periodic expense of these plans was $6 million and $4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively.Non-controlling InterestFor consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as non-controlling interests. As of December 31, 2020, our non-controlling interests include those related to the non-ICE limited partners' interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries, non-controlling interest in ICE Futures Abu Dhabi and redeemable non-controlling interest of the non-ICE partners in Bakkt.The non-ICE limited partners of our CDS clearing subsidiaries hold a 26.7% ownership interest as of December 31, 2020. During 2020 we received a contribution from a group of minority investors for a non-controlling interest in ICE Futures Abu Dhabi.In December 2018, Bakkt was capitalized with $183 million in initial funding with ICE as the majority owner, along with a group of other minority investors, and in March 2020, an additional $300 million in funding occurred with ICE maintaining its majority ownership. We hold a call option over these interests subject to certain terms. Similarly, the non-ICE partners in Bakkt hold a put option to require us to repurchase their interests subject to certain terms. These minority interests are reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in temporary equity within our consolidated balance sheet and are subject to remeasurement when repurchase is probable. Refer to Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report.Consolidated Income Tax Provision Consolidated income tax expense was $658 million and $521 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate was 24% and 21% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2020 is higher than the effective tax rate for 2019 primarily due to U.K. tax law changes enacted in July 2020, partially offset by favorable state apportionment changes as a result of our acquisition of Ellie Mae, as well as favorable changes in certain international tax provisions as part of the TCJA in 2019.In 2015 and 2016, the U.K. enacted corporate income tax rate reductions from 19% to 17% to be effective prospectively on April 1, 2020 and we recorded associated deferred tax benefits in those years. In July 2020, the U.K. enacted a reinstatement of the U.K. corporate income tax rate back to 19%, effective April 1, 2020. As a result, we revalued our U.K. deferred tax assets and liabilities back to the rate of 19%, and recorded a $65 million deferred tax expense during 2020.On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted and certain income tax related relief was provided under the CARES Act. There was no material impact of the CARES Act on our income tax provision for 2020.See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report, for additional information on these tax items.Quarterly Results of Operations The following quarterly unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income data has been prepared on substantially the same basis as our audited consolidated financial statements and includes all adjustments, consisting only of normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of our consolidated results of operations for the quarters presented. The historical results for any quarter do not necessarily indicate the results expected for any future period. This unaudited condensed consolidated quarterly data should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report.

The acquisition and integration costs in the chart below includes cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received for divestitures, cash paid for equity investments, cash paid for non-controlling interest and redeemable non-controlling interest, and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, in each year.We have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends and the development of our technology platforms. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt, but we 72may also need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities in the future. See “- Future Capital Requirements” below. For a discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic and how the pandemic may impact our business, results of operations or financial condition in the future, including our liquidity and capital resources, see “– Recent Developments"" and “– Risk Factors"" in Part 1, Item 1(A), above.See “- Recent Developments” above for a discussion of the acquisitions that we made during 2020. These acquisitions were funded from borrowing under our Commercial Paper Program and term loan, the net proceeds from the issuance of the August 2020 Notes and cash flows from operations, as well as approximately $1.9 billion, or approximately 18.4 million shares of our common stock, based on our stock price, for the Ellie Mae acquisition.See “- Cash Flow” below for a discussion of our capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.Consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $583 million and $841 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We had $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was $292 million. Due to U.S. tax reform, the majority of our foreign earnings since January 1, 2018 have been subject to immediate U.S. income taxation, and the existing non-U.S. unrestricted cash balance can be distributed to the U.S. in the future with no material additional income tax consequences.Our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. We may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2020, we held $27 million of unrestricted cash that was set aside for legal, regulatory and surveillance operations at NYSE.Cash Flow The following table presents the major components of net changes in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202020192018Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$2,881 $2,659 $2,533 Investing activities(9,830)(594)(1,755)Financing activities6,744 (1,753)(463)Effect of exchange rate changes 8 4 (11)Net (decrease) increase in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents$(197)$316 $304 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, stock based compensation, investment gains and losses and the effects of changes in working capital.The $222 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2020 and 2019 was driven by a $148 million increase in net income and the non-cash impact of deferred taxes of $125 million, partially offset by the timing of NYSE collections on increased billings of $119 million and higher income taxes paid as a result of the U.K. government accelerating its required income tax installment payments in 2020. The remaining change is due to fluctuations in our working capital and the timing of various payments such as transaction-related expenses.Investing Activities Consolidated net cash used in investing activities in 2020 and 2019 relates to cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, a return of capital related to our investment in OCC, proceeds from investments related to MERS and changes in capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs. 73We paid cash for acquisitions, net of the cash of the companies acquired, of $9.4 billion and $352 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, primarily relating to the Ellie Mae acquisition in 2020 and the Simplifile acquisition in 2019.In 2019, we had a $60 million return of capital related to our equity method investment in the OCC and $41 million proceeds from investments related to MERS. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report for additional details on these investments.We had capital expenditures of $207 million and $153 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and we had capitalized software development costs of $203 million and $152 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware and software purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements. The software development expenditures primarily relate to the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services, mortgage services and clearing houses.Financing Activities Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily relates to $9.6 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of the May 2020 Notes and the August 2020 Notes, borrowings under a term loan facility and $1.1 billion in net issuances under our Commercial Paper Program. Cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by repayments of our $1.25 billion December 2020 Senior Notes, and the early payoff of the term loan mentioned above, $1.2 billion in repurchases of common stock, $669 million in dividend payments to our stockholders and $74 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises.Consolidated net cash used in financing activities in 2019 primarily relates to $1.5 billion in repurchases of common stock, $360 million in net borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program, $621 million in dividend payments to stockholders and $65 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises.See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.Debt As of December 31, 2020, we had $16.5 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of $12.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes, $1.2 billion of floating rate senior notes, $2.4 billion under our U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program and $6 million under a line of credit at our ICE India subsidiary. The commercial paper notes had original maturities ranging from four to 266 days as of December 31, 2020, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.40% per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 82 days. Commercial paper notes of $1.3 billion with original maturities ranging from two to 87 days were outstanding as of December 31, 2019, with a weighted average interest rate of 1.84% per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 22 days. Our current fixed rate debt principal of $13.1 billion has a weighted average maturity of 16 years and a weighted average cost of 3.0% per annum. We have a $3.7 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as primary administrative agent, issuing lender and swing-line lender, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. As of December 31, 2020, of the $3.7 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the Credit Facility, $2.4 billion is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program and $171 million is required to support certain broker-dealer and other subsidiary commitments. The amount required to backstop the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining $1.1 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, acting as a back-stop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.On August 21, 2020, we entered into a $750 million 18-month senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility with a maturity date of February 21, 2022. We borrowed in full under the facility on September 3, 2020 and the proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Ellie Mae acquisition. We had the option to prepay the facility in whole or in part at any time, and paid off the full balance of the loan on December 16, 2020. Interest on borrowings under this term loan facility were based on the principal amount outstanding at LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which was equal to 1.125%.On August 20, 2020, we issued $6.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, comprised of $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due in 2023, $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0.70% senior notes due in 2023, $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.85% senior notes due in 2032, $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.65% senior notes due in 2040, and $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.00% 74senior notes due in 2060. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Ellie Mae acquisition.On May 26, 2020, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, comprised of $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.10% senior notes due in 2030 and $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.00% senior notes due in 2050. We used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including to fund the redemption of our $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.75% senior notes due in December 2020 and to pay down a portion of our commercial paper outstanding.Our Commercial Paper Program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. We had net issuances of $1.1 billion under our Commercial Paper Program during 2020.Upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. To mitigate this risk, we maintain an undrawn back-stop bank revolving credit facility for an aggregate amount which meets or exceeds the amount issued under our Commercial Paper Program at any time. If we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the back-stop revolving facility. However, electing to do so would result in higher interest expense.For additional details of our debt instruments, refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.Capital ReturnIn December 2019, our Board approved an aggregate of $2.4 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective January 1, 2020. The $2.4 billion replaced the previous amount approved by the Board.During 2020, we repurchased 13.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $1.2 billion, including 10.4 million shares at a cost of $948 million under our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan and 3.2 million shares at a cost of $299 million on the open market. In 2019, we repurchased 17.4 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $1.5 billion, including 16.1 million shares at a cost of $1.4 billion under our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan and 1.3 million shares at a cost of $100 million on the open market. Shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. We discontinued stock repurchases and terminated our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan in August 2020 in connection with our Ellie Mae acquisition. The remaining balance of Board approved funds for future repurchase is $1.2 billion. The approval of our Board for the share repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. In addition, our Board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time.From time to time, we enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, as authorized by our Board, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. The timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. In making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, management considers multiple factors, including overall stock market conditions, our common stock price performance, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our Board, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.During 2020, we paid cash dividends of $1.20 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including quarterly dividends of $0.30 per share, for an aggregate payout of $669 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years. Future Capital Requirements Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases. We currently expect to incur capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between $400 million and 75$430 million in 2021, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses. In December 2019, our Board approved an aggregate of $2.4 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective on January 1, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we had $1.2 billion authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details on our stock repurchase program. Our Board has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the Board or the Audit Committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined net income payout ratio. For the first quarter of 2021, we announced a $0.33 per share dividend payable on March 31, 2021 to stockholders of record as of March 17, 2021.Other than the facilities for the ICE Clearing Houses, our Credit Facility and our Commercial Paper Program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties. See Notes 10 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. In the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. However, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. See “-Risk Factors"" and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.Non-GAAP Measures We use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent GAAP measures or that supplement the information provided by our GAAP measures. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this Annual Report, and believe that these measures, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making period-to-period comparisons of results because the adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.The table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders and adjusted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. These measures, including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts), are as follows:76Exchanges SegmentFixed Income and Data Services SegmentMortgage Technology SegmentConsolidatedYear Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,202020192018202020192018202020192018202020192018Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses$3,631 $3,307 $3,276 $1,810 $1,756 $1,681 $595 $139 $22 $6,036 $5,202 $4,979 Operating expenses1,242 1,140 1,114 1,318 1,317 1,265 443 72 17 3,003 2,529 2,396 Less: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles74 68 71 191 225 213 123 16 3 388 309 287 Less: Transaction and integration costs and acquisition-related success fees 12 — — — — 30 89 — — 101 — 30 Less: Impairment of developed software11 — — — — — — — — 11 — — Less: Impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore— 31 — — — — — — — — 31 — Less: Accruals relating to a regulatory settlement— — — 8 — — — — — 8 — — Less: Impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada— — 4 — — — — — — — — 4 Less: Employee severance costs related to ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada operations— — 4 — — — — — — — — 4 Adjusted operating expenses$1,145 $1,041 $1,035 $1,119 $1,092 $1,022 $231 $56 $14 $2,495 $2,189 $2,071 Operating income$2,389 $2,167 $2,162 $492 $439 $416 $152 $67 $5 $3,033 $2,673 $2,583 Adjusted operating income$2,486 $2,266 $2,241 $691 $664 $659 $364 $83 $8 $3,541 $3,013 $2,908 Operating margin66 %66 %66 %27 %25 %25 %25 %48 %20 %50 %51 %52 %Adjusted operating margin68 %69 %68 %38 %38 %39 %61 %59 %34 %59 %58 %58 %Net income attributable to ICE common stockholders$2,089 $1,933 $1,988 Add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles388 309 287 Add: Transaction and integration costs and acquisition-related success fees 101 — 30 Less: Gain on equity investments(55)— — Add: Extinguishment of 2020 Senior Notes14 — — Add: Pre-acquisition interest expense on debt issued for Ellie Mae acquisition5 — — Add: Impairment of developed software11 — — Add: Impairment of CAT promissory notes2 16 — Add: Impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore— 31 — Less: Gain on acquisition of MERS — — (110)Add: Accrual for potential legal settlements30 — — Add: Accruals relating to a regulatory settlement8 — — Add: Impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada— — 4 Add: Employee severance costs related to ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada operations— — 4 Add: Adjustment to gain on divestiture of Trayport, net— — 1 Less: Income tax effect for the above items (129)(90)(98)Less: Deferred tax adjustments from U.S. tax rate reduction— — (11)Add/(Less): Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles36 (8)(5)Add/(Less): Other tax adjustments— 3 (13)Adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders$2,500 $2,194 $2,077 Basic earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$3.79 $3.44 $3.46 Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$3.77 $3.42 $3.43 Adjusted basic earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$4.53 $3.91 $3.61 Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$4.51 $3.88 $3.59 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding552 561 575 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding555 565 579 Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-GAAP adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results. Acquisition-related transaction costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. However, we adjust for the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to acquisitions such as Ellie Mae and Interactive Data given the 77magnitude of the $11.4 billion and $5.6 billion purchase prices, respectively, of these acquisitions. We also adjust for the acquisition-related transaction costs related to the expected merger between Bakkt and VIH due to the significance of the transaction. The integration of Interactive Data was completed by June 2018. In 2020, we also included a $10 million adjustment for Bridge2 Solutions acquisition costs resulting from a Bakkt incentive award market condition estimation adjustment as an acquisition-related success fee. This adjustment was directly related to the March 2020 capital call to fund the acquisition of Bridge2 Solutions and we believe is therefore appropriate since we exclude costs directly related to financing a transaction.The extinguishment payment on the 2020 Senior Notes is included as a non-GAAP adjustment as it relates to the June 2020 early redemption of senior notes with an original maturity of December 1, 2020 as a result of our new senior notes offering in May 2020. These costs include both a make-whole redemption payment and duplicative interest and are not considered part of our normal operations. We also adjust for pre-acquisition interest expense on the August 2020 debt issued to fund a portion of the purchase price of our Ellie Mae acquisition as we do not consider this to be reflective of our normal operations.We include the 2019 impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore as a non-GAAP adjustment. This impairment is not based on our core business operations, but rather was a result of the estimated fair value of an acquired intangible asset falling below its carrying value. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report. We include the 2020 and 2019 promissory note impairment charges on work performed by the original plan processor on the CAT as non-GAAP adjustments. These are included as non-GAAP adjustments as these are not considered a part of our core business operations. See additional discussion on the CAT, above, in Item 1(A) ""-Risk Factors"" in this Annual Report.In addition, we also include the following items as non-GAAP adjustments, as each of these are not considered a part of our core business operations:•2020: Impairment of software developed at our Bakkt subsidiary since it relates to the build-out of a fundamental software design vs. a recurring upgrade;•2020: accrual for potential legal settlements;•2020: accruals relating to a regulatory settlement;•2020: the $35 million gain on the fair value adjustment of our Euroclear equity investment and the $20 million gain on the sale of our BIDS equity investment; •2018: the gain recognized on our initial majority investment in MERS in connection with our acquisition of 100% of the remaining MERS interests;•2018: the impairment loss on exchange registration intangible assets and employee severance costs related to the closure of ICE Futures Canada and ICE Clear Canada; and •2018: a subsequent adjustment to reduce the gain on the divestiture of Trayport.The tax items in non-GAAP adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments or tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance. The following tax-related items are included as non-GAAP adjustments:•Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles, including the impact of U.K. and U.S. state tax law changes and apportionment updates, as well as foreign tax law changes which resulted in deferred tax expense/(benefit) of $36 million, ($8 million) and ($5 million) in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively;•Deferred tax benefits of $11 million in 2018 resulting from changes in estimates as a result of the enactment of the TCJA which reduced the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%; and•Other tax adjustments of $3 million in 2019 for audit settlement payments primarily related to pre-acquisition tax matters in connection with our acquisition of NYSE in 2013; and other tax adjustments in 2018 including a $17 million tax benefit on the sale of Trayport, partially offset by an audit settlement for a pre-acquisition period in connection with our acquisition of NYSE in 2013.For additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and “- Recent Developments,” “- Consolidated Operating Expenses”, “- Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” and “-Consolidated Income Tax Provision” above.78Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As described in Notes 3 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, certain clearing house collateral and Bakkt custodial assets are reported off-balance sheet. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following presents our contractual obligations (which we intend to fund from existing cash as well as cash flow from operations) and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2020 (in millions): Payments Due by PeriodTotalLess Than 1 Year1-3 Years4-5 YearsAfter 5 YearsContractual Obligations:Short-term and long-term debt and interest $23,084 $2,799 $4,696 $1,866 $13,723 Operating lease obligations 426 79 152 112 83 Purchase obligations244 152 88 4 — Total contractual cash obligations $23,754 $3,030 $4,936 $1,982 $13,806 Purchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.We have excluded from the contractual obligations and commercial commitments listed above $84.1 billion in cash margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable. Clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. The cash deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ICE NGX administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. It has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physically-settled contract, each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds and delivery contracts payable. We have also excluded unrecognized tax benefits, or UTBs. As of December 31, 2020, our cumulative UTBs were $188 million, and interest and penalties related to UTBs were $39 million. We are under examination by various tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. It is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our UTBs. As of December 31, 2020, we, through NYSE, have net obligations of $130 million related to our pension and other benefit programs. The date of payment under these net obligations cannot be determined and have been excluded from the table above. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs. In addition, the future funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT is ultimately expected to be provided by both the SROs and broker-dealers. To date, however, funding has been provided solely by the SROs, and future funding is expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the SEC and subsequently collected by industry members. See ""- Non-GAAP Measures"" above. New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.79Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and re-evaluate them on a periodic basis. Based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. The values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets, including identified intangible assets. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, trademarks, technology, trading products, data, exchange registrations, backlog, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments and estimates may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not. In performing the allocation of the acquisitions' purchase price to assets and liabilities, we consider, among other factors, the intended use of the acquired assets, analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. At the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. We continue to review and assess our estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by GAAP, which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Estimation uncertainty may exist due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of an acquired business in our discounted cash flow models. Significant assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and expense synergies that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate.Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, and we have identified four reporting units, which have been updated in 2020 to reflect our new segment presentation. Our reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the NYSE, Other Exchanges, Fixed Income and Data Services, and Mortgage Technology reporting units. These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. In accordance with our adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, or ASU-2017, for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-80lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the fair value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference. Alternatively, we may choose to bypass the qualitative option and perform quantitative testing to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value. For our goodwill impairment testing, we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach. For our testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches.Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. These estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. During 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $31 million on the remaining value of exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore as a result of a decrease in fair value determined during our annual impairment testing. We did not record any impairments in 2020 as a result of our goodwill or indefinite-lived impairment testing.We are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. If an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. Fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., U.K. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118, or SAB 118, provided guidance for companies that had not completed their accounting for the income tax effects of the TCJA in the period of enactment, allowing for a measurement period of up to one year after the enactment date to finalize the recording of the related tax impacts. As of December 31, 2018, we had completed our accounting for the tax effects of the enactment of the TCJA. We reaffirmed our position that we were not subject to transition tax under the TCJA as of December 31, 2017. In addition, we concluded that the $764 million of deferred tax benefit recorded in the 2017 financial statements was a reasonable estimate of the TCJA’s impact on our deferred tax and no further adjustments are necessary. The FASB Staff also provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. We have completed our analysis of the effects of these provisions and have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred.We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.We operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing 81and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. ITEM 7 (A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments were $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $245 million and $282 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or Canadian dollars, and the remaining amounts are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. A hypothetical 50% decrease in short-term interest rates would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $5 million as of December 31, 2020, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2020, we had $16.5 billion in outstanding debt, of which $12.9 billion relates to our fixed rate senior notes. The remaining amount outstanding of $3.6 billion relates to $2.4 billion outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program and $1.2 billion of floating rate senior notes, each of which bear interest at fluctuating rates, and $6 million under a line of credit at our ICE India subsidiary. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates relating to the amounts of floating rate debt outstanding as of December 31, 2020 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $36 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. The interest rates on our Commercial Paper Program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. The weighted average interest rate on our Commercial Paper Program decreased from 1.84% as of December 31, 2019 to 0.40% as of December 31, 2020. The decrease in the Commercial Paper Program weighted average interest rate was primarily due to the decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to decrease the federal funds short-term interest rate by 150 basis points in March 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19 on financial markets, which impacted the liquidity and pricing volatility for all commercial paper issuances. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in short-term interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk As an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling, Canadian dollars or euros, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. Certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. Our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2020 and 2019 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates): 82 Year Ended December 31, 2020Year Ended December 31, 2019 Pound Sterling EuroPound Sterling EuroAverage exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the current year$1.2832 $1.1412 $1.2769 $1.1195 Average exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the prior year$1.2769 $1.1195 $1.3356 $1.1813 Average exchange rate increase (decrease)— %2 %(4)%(5)%Foreign denominated percentage of: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses7 % 6 %8 %5 %Operating expenses9 % 2 %10 %2 %Operating income6 %9 %7 %8 %Impact of the currency fluctuations (1) on: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses$1 $6 $(19)$(15)Operating expenses$1 $1 $(11)$(3)Operating income$— $5 $(8)$(12)(1) Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.We have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. In both 2020 and 2019, 13% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and in 2020 and 2019, 11% and 12%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables occurs through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $5 million in both 2020 and 2019 inclusive of the impact of foreign currency hedging transactions. The foreign currency transaction gains/(losses) were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. A 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity, would result in a foreign currency loss of $15 million.We entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2020 and 2019 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. Although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities. We have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. Our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): As of December 31, 2020 Position in pounds sterlingPosition in Canadian dollarsPosition in eurosAssets£761 C$1,359 €147 of which goodwill represents589 403 92 Liabilities86 960 46 Net currency position£675 C$399 €101 Net currency position, in $USD$922 $313 $123 Negative impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates$92 $31 $12 Foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) within our balance sheet. See the table below for the portion of equity attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments as well as the activity by year included within our statement of other comprehensive income. The impact of 83the foreign currency exchange rate differences in the table below were primarily driven by fluctuations of the pound sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar which were 1.3665, 1.3260 and 1.2756 as of December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments, monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests. Clearing House Cash Deposit RisksThe ICE Clearing Houses hold material amounts of clearing member cash and cash equivalent deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. Refer to Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ICE Clearing Houses' cash and cash equivalent deposits, which were $84.1 billion as of December 31, 2020. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the ICE Clearing Houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the clearing members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated:•Credit Risk: When a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. Credit risk is managed by using exposure limits depending on the credit profile of the counterparty as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. Our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. We seek to substantially mitigate the credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.•Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and at the right time. To mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.•Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value. Our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments. For example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest 84cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. In addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, U.S. Treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (Euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities. •Security Issuer Risk: Security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments. •Investment Counterparty Risk: Investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers. When engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house control. Additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. The typical haircut for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount which provides additional excess collateral. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty’s obligation.The ICE Clearing Houses may use third-party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house. Such advisors do not hold clearing member cash or cash equivalent deposits or the underlying investments. Clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians including JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A., Citibank N.A., BNY Mellon, BMO Harris N.A. and Euroclear Bank Brussels (for non-U.S. dollar deposits). The ICE Clearing Houses employ (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives. •Cross-Currency Margin Deposit Risk: Each of the ICE Clearing Houses may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in U.S. dollars to secure a Euro margin obligation). The ICE Clearing Houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility. Cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.Impact of Inflation We have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. In the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.85",2023-12-30 20:40:17.244752
1571949,ICE,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.",2022,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 4, 2021. Overview We are a provider of market infrastructure, data services and technology solutions to a broad range of customers including financial institutions, corporations and government entities. These products, which span major asset classes including futures, equities, fixed income and U.S. residential mortgages, provide our customers with access to mission critical tools that are designed to increase asset class transparency and workflow efficiency. We report our results in three segments: Exchanges, Fixed Income and Data Services, and Mortgage Technology. The majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S. and U.K.•In our Exchanges segment, we operate regulated marketplaces for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities.•In our Fixed Income and Data Services segment, we provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services as well as global CDS clearing and multi-asset class data delivery solutions.•In our Mortgage Technology segment, we provide an end-to-end technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to address the inefficiencies that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market.Recent Developments Bakkt TransactionOn October 15, 2021, Bakkt Holdings, LLC, or Bakkt, completed its merger with VPC Impact Acquisition Holdings, or VIH, a special purpose acquisition company sponsored by Victory Park Capital, or VPC. Bakkt is an integrated platform that enables customers and consumers to transact in digital assets.The business combination between Bakkt and VIH resulted in enterprise value of approximately $2.1 billion, including approximately $479 million of cash on the combined company’s balance sheet, reflecting a contribution of up to $123 million of cash held in VIH’s trust account, and a $325 million concurrent private investment in public equity, or PIPE, of Class A common stock of the combined company and $31 million of cash held in Bakkt accounts. The PIPE was priced at $10.00 per share and included a $47 million commitment from us. The newly combined company has been renamed Bakkt Holdings, Inc. and is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE.As part of the transaction, Bakkt’s existing equity holders and management rolled 100% of their equity into the combined company, and are subject to a six-month lockup period. Certain shareholders of VIH exercised their redemption rights, and at closing, Bakkt equity holders, including ICE, owned approximately 81% of the combined company, VIH’s public shareholders owned approximately 5%, VPC owned 2%, and PIPE investors (a group that also includes us) owned approximately 12% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the combined company.Following completion of the business combination, we initially held a 68% economic interest and a minority voting interest in the combined company. Prior to the closing, Bakkt revenues and operating expenses were reported within our consolidated revenues and operating expenses. Following the closing, as a consequence of holding a minority voting interest in the combined company, during the fourth quarter of 2021 we deconsolidated Bakkt and treat it as an equity method investment within our financial statements. We recorded a gain on the transaction of $1.4 billion during the fourth quarter of 2021, which is included in other non-operating income within our consolidated income statement. For the three 43months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded estimated equity losses of ($92 million) related to our investment in Bakkt.COVID-19Since March 2020, the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions globally and has led governmental authorities to take unprecedented measures to mitigate the spread of the disease, including travel bans, border closings, business closures, quarantines and shelter-in-place orders, and to take actions designed to stabilize markets and promote economic growth. From an operational perspective, our businesses, including our exchanges, clearing houses, listing venues, data services businesses, and mortgage platforms, have remained open and we do not have any plans to close any of our business operations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken preventative measures and implemented contingency plans, and many of our employees are continuing to work remotely. We believe that our global office closures and phased re-opening measures were and continue to be in compliance, as necessary, with local government directives and social distancing directives. We continue to monitor local government mandates in determining our office re-openings, re-closures and work-related travel.Global health concerns relating to COVID-19 and preventive measures taken to reduce its spread have created significant volatility in financial markets, which has resulted in higher trading volumes for some of our products and increased demand for our services. The extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and severity of the outbreak, the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 over the long term and against new and emerging variants thereof, and the actions taken to contain the spread of the disease or mitigate its impact. We continue to monitor this dynamic situation, including guidance and regulations issued by U.S. and other governmental authorities. In light of the continually evolving nature of the COVID-19 outbreak, we are not able at this time to estimate the ultimate effect of the pandemic on our business, results of operations or financial condition in the future.Consolidated Financial HighlightsThe following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts): 44Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,20212020Change20202019ChangeRevenues, less transaction-based expenses $7,146 $6,036 18 %$6,036 $5,202 16 %Operating expenses $3,697 $3,003 23 %$3,003 $2,529 19 %Adjusted operating expenses(1)$2,977 $2,495 19 %$2,495 $2,189 14 %Operating income $3,449 $3,033 14 %$3,033 $2,673 13 %Adjusted operating income(1)$4,169 $3,541 18 %$3,541 $3,013 18 %Operating margin 48 %50 %(2 pts)50 %51 %(1 pt)Adjusted operating margin(1)58 %59 %(1 pt)59 %58 %1 ptOther income (expense), net $2,249 $(267)n/a$(267)$(192)39 %Income tax expense$1,629 $658 148 %$658 $521 26 %Effective tax rate 29 %24 %5 pts24 %21 %3 ptsNet income attributable to ICE$4,058 $2,089 94 %$2,089 $1,933 8 %Adjusted net income attributable to ICE(1)$2,910 $2,449 19 %$2,449 $2,142 14 %Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$7.18 $3.77 90 %$3.77 $3.42 10 %Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders(1)$5.15 $4.41 17 %$4.41 $3.79 16 %Cash flows from operating activities$3,123 $2,881 8 %$2,881 $2,659 8 %*Percentage changes in the table above deemed ""n/a"" are not meaningful.(1) The adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance.

See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below. 45•Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.1 billion in 2021 from 2020. The increase in revenues includes $44 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2021 from 2020.•Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $834 million in 2020 from 2019. The increase in revenues includes $7 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2020 from 2019. •Operating expenses increased $694 million in 2021 from 2020. The increase in operating expenses includes $22 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2021 from 2020.•Operating expenses increased $474 million in 2020 from 2019. The increase in operating expenses includes $2 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2020 from 2019.•Other income (expense), net, in 2021 primarily includes our gain on the Bakkt transaction of $1.4 billion, our gain on the sale of our Coinbase Global, Inc., or Coinbase, investment of $1.2 billion, equity earnings in OCC of $51 million, estimated equity losses in our investment in Bakkt during the post-merger period of $92 million, dividend income from Euroclear plc, or Euroclear, of $60 million, a fair value adjustment gain on our Euroclear investment of $34 million and interest expense of $423 million.•Other income (expense), net, in 2020 primarily includes interest expense of $357 million, equity earnings in OCC of $71 million, an accrual for potential legal settlements of $30 million, a fair value adjustment gain on our Euroclear investment of $35 million, and gain on the sale of our BIDS Trading, LP, or BIDS, investment of $20 million.•The effective tax rate in 2021 is higher than the effective tax rate in 2020 primarily due to the deferred income tax impacts resulting from the U.K. tax law changes as well as the Bakkt transaction. In June 2021, the U.K. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023.•The effective tax rate in 2020 was higher than the effective tax rate in 2019 primarily due to U.K. tax law changes enacted in July 2020, partially offset by favorable state apportionment changes as a result of our acquisition of Ellie Mae, as well as favorable changes in certain international tax provisions as part of the U.S. Federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, in 2019.Business Environment and Market TrendsOur business environment has been characterized by:•globalization of marketplaces, customers and competitors;•growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation; •commodity, interest rate and financial markets uncertainty;•growing demand for data to inform customers' risk management and investment decisions;•evolving, increasing and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions;•price volatility increasing customers' demand for risk management services;•increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies;•customers' preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity;•the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements;•rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; and•consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.Recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several non-U.S. regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will 46have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” included in this Annual Report, Brexit, the implementation of MiFID II and other regulations may result in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of recurring revenues from 34% in 2014 to 49% in 2021. These recurring revenues include data services, listings and various mortgage technology solutions.Many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: •increasing global regulatory demands; •greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; •greater emphasis on risk management; •market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; •the move to passive investing and indexation; •ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; •increased automation of fixed income, mortgage and other less automated markets; •the development of new data products; •the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; •new entrants; and •increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, and prudently manage expenses, in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, markets and technology solutions.Segment ResultsOur business is conducted through three reportable business segments, comprised of the following: •Our Exchanges segment includes our trade execution and clearing within our global futures network and NYSE businesses, various data and connectivity services that are directly related to those exchange platforms, administration fees and our NYSE listings business. Trade execution and clearing products include energy, agricultural and metals, financial futures and options, cash equities, equity options, OTC and other; •Our Fixed Income and Data Services segment includes pricing and reference data, analytics, indices, trade execution and clearing within our ICE Bonds and CDS businesses, consolidated feeds and our ICE Global Network businesses; and•Our Mortgage Technology segment includes origination technology, closing solutions, data and analytics and other mortgage technology businesses. While revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. We directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. Otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments. Our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, origination technology revenues include those related to our ICE Mortgage Technology network (previously reported in closing solutions revenues) and closing solutions revenues now include registration revenues related to MERSCORP Holdings, Inc., or MERS, (previously reported in other revenues). We believe these changes more accurately reflect how we operate the business. Prior-year periods have been adjusted to reflect these changes.For details on trends in recent prior-year periods, refer to our 2020 and 2019 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.47Exchanges SegmentThe following presents selected statements of income data for our Exchanges segment (dollars in millions):(1) The adjusted figures in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these adjusted numbers are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Transaction and clearing revenues consist of fees collected from derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing, and are reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below. Rates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions. Because transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis, revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and product mix. Our data and connectivity services revenues are recurring subscription fees related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. Our listings revenues are also recurring subscription fees that we earn for the provision of NYSE listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.In 2021 and 2020, 17% and 14%, respectively, of our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar, our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were higher by $30 million in 2021 from 2020.Our exchange transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $1.0 billion and $962 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The increase in rebates is primarily due to the launch of new products, including ICE Murban crude oil futures and the Sterling Overnight Index Average, or SONIA. •Energy Futures and Options: Total energy volume increased 1% and revenues increased 10% in 2021 from 2020.–Total oil volume increased 3% in 2021 from 2020 driven by price volatility related to oil supply and demand dynamics and macroeconomic uncertainty in late 2021.–Our global natural gas futures and options volume decreased 4% in 2021 from 2020 as 2020 benefited from elevated volatility related to COVID-19, partially offset by 2021 continued growth in our TTF and Asian JKM gas complexes driven by the globalization of gas, coupled with heightened price volatility in 2021 related to natural gas supply and demand dynamics in the U.K. and Europe.49–Our environmentals and other futures and options volume increased 18% to record levels in 2021 from 2020 due to an increase in the price of carbon and continued demand for market-based mechanisms to price climate risk and help enable greenhouse gas reduction goals.•Agricultural and Metals Futures and Options: Total volume in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets decreased 10% and revenues decreased 7% in 2021 from 2020. The overall decrease in agricultural volumes was due to 2020 benefiting from elevated volatility related to COVID-19 and a sharp decline in oil prices, partially offset by elevated volatility in late 2021 as a result of weather-related supply and demand dynamics impacting our Coffee and Cotton markets as well as geopolitical events impacting our Cocoa markets.–Sugar futures and options volumes decreased 21% in 2021 from 2020. –Other agricultural and metal futures and options volumes were flat in 2021 as compared to 2020. •Financial Futures and Options: Total volume increased 2% and revenues increased 10% in our financial futures and options markets in 2021 from 2020. –Interest rate futures and options volume and revenue increased 6% and 23% in 2021 from 2020, respectively, driven by interest rate volatility from increased speculation of central bank activity due to post-pandemic global economic re-opening and inflation concerns. Interest rate futures and options revenues were $237 million and $193 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.–Other financial futures and options volume, which includes our MSCI®, FTSE® and NYSE FANG+ equity index products, decreased 12% and revenue decreased 4% in 2021 from 2020. Other financial futures and options volume decreased as 2020 benefited from elevated volatility across global equity markets driven by the emergence of COVID-19. Other financial futures and options revenues were $157 million and $164 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.•Cash Equities and Equity Options: Cash equities volume decreased 6% in 2021 from 2020 as 2020 benefited from elevated volatility across global equity markets driven by the emergence of COVID-19. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $246 million and $276 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Equity options volume increased 40% in 2021 from 2020 driven by increased participation and higher market share. Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $109 million and $101 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. •OTC and Other: OTC and other transactions include revenues from our OTC energy business and other trade confirmation services, as well as interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. Our OTC and other revenues increased 10% in 2021 from 2020. Following the October 2021 Bakkt transaction, Bakkt revenues are no longer included within our OTC and other revenues. •Data and Connectivity Services: Our data and connectivity services revenues increased 6% in 2021 from 2020. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers and increased purchases by existing customers.•Listings Revenues: Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies. Listings revenues increased 7% in 2021 from 2020, driven by equity capital markets activity, including an increase in demand for special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, listings.Listings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges– original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. All listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.In addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.50In a record year for new issuance, NYSE raised $221 billion in IPOs and follow-on offerings from over 594 transactions, an increase of 20% from $185 billion raised in 2020.Selected Operating DataThe following charts and tables present trading activity in our futures and options markets by commodity type based on the total number of contracts traded, as well as futures and options rate per contract (in millions, except for percentages and rate per contract amounts):Volume and Rate per ContractYear Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,20212020Change20202019ChangeNumber of contracts traded (in millions):Energy futures and options 782 773 1 %773 669 15 % Agricultural and metals futures and options 98 108 (10)%108 111 (3)%Financial futures and options 634 619 2 %619 630 (2)%Total 1,514 1,500 1 %1,500 1,410 6 %Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,20212020Change20202019ChangeAverage Daily Volume of contracts traded (in thousands):Energy futures and options 3,103 3,054 2 %3,054 2,655 15 % Agricultural and metals futures and options 388 428 (9)%428 442 (3)%Financial futures and options 2,475 2,409 3 %2,409 2,460 (2)%Total 5,966 5,891 1 %5,891 5,557 6 %Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,Rate per contract:20212020Change20202019ChangeEnergy futures and options$1.58 $1.45 9 %$1.45 $1.48 (2)%Agricultural and metals futures and options$2.34 $2.27 3 %$2.27 $2.25 1 %Financial futures and options$0.61 $0.57 7 %$0.57 $0.52 10 %51Open interest is the aggregate number of contracts (long or short) that clearing members hold either for their own account or on behalf of their clients. Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently “open,” – in other words, contracts that have been entered into but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange.

Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges.Transaction-Based Expenses Our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government’s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals and are subject to change. We, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed to equal the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of 53payment by us will vary from collections. Section 31 fees were $248 million and $622 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in Section 31 fees was primarily related to a decline in rates, which were revised in February of both years. The fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the SEC semi-annually as required. The total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was $57 million as of December 31, 2021.We make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges which are included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. Cash liquidity payments, routing and clearing fees were $1.8 billion and $1.6 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginThe following chart summarizes our Exchanges segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions).

In both 2021 and 2020, 14% of our Fixed Income and Data Services segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar during 2021, our Fixed Income and Data Services revenues were higher by $14 million in 2021 than in 2020.Fixed Income and Data Services RevenuesOur Fixed Income and Data Services revenues increased 4% in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to growth in our fixed income data and analytics products and our other data and network services.•Fixed Income Execution: Fixed income execution includes revenues from ICE Bonds. Execution fees are reported net of rebates, which were nominal in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Our fixed income execution revenues decreased 25% in 2021 from 2020. The decrease in revenue was due to 2020 benefiting from price volatility related to COVID-19, as well as decreased retail activity, particularly in municipal and corporate bonds, as a result of low interest rates.•CDS Clearing: CDS clearing revenues decreased 8% in 2021 from 2020. The notional value of CDS cleared was $17.0 trillion and $17.9 trillion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Elevated volatility in 2020 related to COVID-19 benefited 2020 revenues, with volatility and cleared volumes generally returning to more normal levels late in 2021.•Fixed Income Data and Analytics: Our fixed income data and analytics revenues increased 6% in 2021 from 2020. The increase in revenue was due to strength in our index business and continued growth in our pricing and reference data business driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, and increased purchases by existing customers.•Other Data and Network Services: Our other data and network services revenues increased 8% in 2021 from 2020. The increase in revenues was driven primarily by growth in our ICE Global Network offering, coupled with strength in our consolidated feeds and desktop revenues.Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues, which includes Fixed Income Data and Analytics as well as Other Data and Network Services, subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. ASV does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. However, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a precise growth forecast of the next 12 months of data services revenues.As of December 31, 2021, ASV was $1.646 billion, which increased 4.9% compared to the ASV as of December 31, 2020. ASV represents nearly 100% of total data services revenues for this segment. This does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations.56Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginThe following chart summarizes our Fixed Income and Data Services segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions).

Our mortgage technology business enables greater workflow efficiency for customers focused on originating U.S. residential mortgage loans. Mortgage technology revenues increased $812 million or 137% in 2021 from 2020. Revenues from Ellie Mae following our September 2020 acquisition were $351 million in 2020. •Origination technology: Our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage transaction, automating the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information and enabling automated enforcement of rules and business practices designed to help ensure that each completed loan transaction is of high quality and adheres to secondary market standards. These revenues are based on recurring Software as a Service, or SaaS, subscription fees, with an additive transaction-based or Success-Based Pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription.In addition, the ICE Mortgage Technology network provides originators connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure exchange of information between our customers and a broad ecosystem of third-party service providers, as well as lenders and investors that are critical to consummating the millions of loan transactions that occur on our origination network each year. Revenue from the ICE Mortgage Technology network is largely transaction-based.•Closing solutions: Our closing solutions uniquely connect key participants, such as lenders, title and settlement agents and individual county recorders, to digitize the traditionally manual and paper-based closing and recording process. Our closing solutions also include revenues from the MERS database, a leading system for recording and tracking changes in mortgage servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in loans secured by U.S. residential real estate. Closing solutions revenues increased in 2021 from 2020 as a result of an increase in residential home sales, market share gains and increased demand and adoption of digital solutions. Revenues from closing solutions are largely transaction-based.•Data and Analytics: Revenues include those related to ICE Mortgage Technology’s Automation, Intelligence, Quality, or AIQ, offering, which applies machine learning and artificial intelligence, or AI, to the entire loan origination process, offering customers greater efficiency by streamlining data collection and validation through our automated document recognition and data extraction capabilities. AIQ revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature. In addition, our data offerings include real-time industry and peer benchmarking tools, which provide originators a granular view into the real-time trends of nearly half the U.S. residential mortgage market. We also provide a Data as a Service, or DaaS, offering through private data clouds for lenders to access their own data and origination information. Revenues related to our data products are largely subscription-based and recurring in nature.•Other: Other revenues include professional services fees, as well as revenues from ancillary products. Other revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature.The following chart summarizes our Mortgage Technology segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions).

Due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro, our consolidated operating expenses were $22 million higher in 2021 than in 2020. See Item 7(A) “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information.Compensation and Benefits Expenses Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and individual employee performance. The performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in our number of employees. The below chart summarizes the significant drivers of our compensation and benefits expense results for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except employee headcount).Year Ended December 31,20212020ChangeEmployee headcount 8,858 8,890 — %Stock-based compensation expenses$155 $127 22 %Employee headcount decreased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to the deconsolidation of Bakkt, which was partially offset by increased hiring in 2021. Ellie Mae compensation and benefits expense was $174 million higher in 2021 than in 2020 due to our September 2020 acquisition. Bakkt compensation and benefits expense was $16 million higher in 2021 than in 2020 due to increases in employee headcount prior to deconsolidating Bakkt. In addition, compensation and benefits expense increased $67 million in 2021 from 2020 due to merit pay increases, above target performance-based compensation and higher employee insurance costs than in 2020 due to the impact of COVID-19. The stock-based compensation expenses in the table above relate to employee stock option and restricted stock awards.Professional Services Expenses Professional services expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in our use of these services in our business. 62Professional services expenses increased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to an increase of $26 million from Ellie Mae which was partially offset by lower legal expenses for 2021.Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration CostsIn 2021, we incurred $59 million in acquisition-related transaction costs related to the deconsolidation of Bakkt, which included $31 million non-cash compensation related to a market condition event triggered on the Bakkt equity incentive awards in connection with the merger of Bakkt and VIH. Additionally, we incurred $39 million in integration costs related to Ellie Mae.We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods.Technology and Communication Expenses Technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and telecommunications costs.Technology and communications expense also includes fees paid for access to external market data, licensing and other fee agreement expenses. Technology and communications expenses may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly. Technology and communications expenses increased by $117 million in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of Ellie Mae expenses, which were $87 million higher in 2021 than in 2020. In addition, technology and communications expenses increased by $24 million in 2021 from 2020 due to increased license fees and data acquisition costs.Rent and Occupancy ExpensesRent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in the U.S., U.K., and India, with smaller offices located throughout the world.Rent and occupancy expenses includes the expenses of Ellie Mae, which increased $6 million in 2021 from 2020. These expenses were partially offset by a reduction in other occupancy expenses in 2021 and the early termination of our NYSE Chicago office lease in 2020. See Item 2 “- Properties” above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2021 from 2020, primarily due to the inclusion of $13 million of Ellie Mae expenses and $12 million of Bakkt expenses related to the launch of Bakkt's digital wallet, Bakkt App. In addition, marketing expenses increased $19 million in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to a higher number of NYSE initial public offerings, or IPOs, which were partially offset by a charitable contribution in support of COVID-19 relief efforts of $10 million and an $8 million regulatory settlement accrual in 2020.Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, aircraft, hardware and networking equipment, software, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of 63businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life.We recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $622 million and $388 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2021 over 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the amortization of Ellie Mae intangible assets of $246 million. We recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $387 million and $363 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2021 over 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the depreciation of Ellie Mae fixed assets of $31 million, partially offset by a software impairment charge of $11 million in 2020 related to a portion of customized software developed at Bakkt that was no longer useful.64Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expense) Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income (expenses) (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,20212020Change20202019ChangeOther income (expense):Interest income$1 $10 (93)%$10 $35 (71)%Interest expense (423)(357)19 (357)(285)25 Other income, net 2,671 80 n/a80 58 38 Total other income (expense), net $2,249 $(267)n/a$(267)$(192)39 %Net income attributable to non-controlling interest $(11)$(19)(44)%$(19)$(27)(27)%Interest IncomeInterest income decreased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to a decrease in short-term interest rates on various investments.Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased in 2021 from 2020 primarily due to the issuance of senior notes in May 2020 to refinance existing debt, the issuance of senior notes in August 2020 related to the Ellie Mae acquisition, and $4 million in accelerated unamortized costs related to the early redemption in September 2021 of the floating rate notes due June 2023, partially offset by a $14 million extinguishment payment we incurred related to the June 2020 early redemption of senior notes with an original maturity of December 1, 2020, or the December 2020 Senior Notes, and $5 million pre-acquisition interest expense on debt issued for Ellie Mae acquisition. See “- Debt” below.Other income (expense), netDuring 2021, Bakkt completed its merger with VIH, which resulted in an initial 68% economic interest, and we recorded a gain of $1.4 billion as other income upon our deconsolidation of Bakkt. Following the merger, we show our economic interest share of estimated Bakkt profits/(losses) as equity earnings, which are also included in other income (expense), net. We recorded other expense of ($92 million) related to our Bakkt investment for the post-merger period during 2021.During 2021, Coinbase completed an IPO and we sold our investment in Coinbase for $1.2 billion, and recorded a gain of $1.2 billion as other income.During 2021, we recorded a gain of $7 million related to the settlement of an acquisition-related indemnification claim from a prior acquisition as other income. In addition, we accrued approximately $16 million related to a legal settlement. In 2020, we recorded an accrual for potential legal settlements of $30 million as other income.We own a 40% interest in the Options Clearing Corporation, or OCC, which we treat as an equity method investment. OCC is regulated by the SEC and the CFTC. We recognized $51 million and $71 million of equity earnings as our share of OCC's estimated profits during 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is included in other income. Refer to Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report for additional details on our OCC investment.In connection with our equity investment in Euroclear, we recognized dividend income of $60 million in 2021 and $19 million in 2019, included in other income. As a result of a 2020 European regulation limiting dividend payments, we did not receive a Euroclear dividend in 2020, but we received two dividend payments during 2021. In addition, in both September 2021 and in November 2020 we became aware of observable price changes in orderly transactions of similar Euroclear investments by third parties. The transactions resulted in fair value adjustments of our Euroclear investment, and we recorded gains of $34 million and $35 million in other income in 2021 and 2020, respectively, including the impacts of foreign currency exchange.We historically held a 9% ownership interest in BIDS, a registered broker-dealer and the operator of the BIDS Alternative Trading System. In December 2020, we sold our investment in BIDS to Cboe and recorded a gain on the sale of $20 million, included in other income.65We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $13 million and $5 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. This was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income (expense), net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables occur in non-functional currencies and there is an increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. See Item 7A “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information on these items.In connection with our adoption of Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-07, Compensation Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, or ASU 2017-07, we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined benefit plans in the income statement as non-operating income on a full retrospective basis. The combined net periodic expense of these plans was $3 million and $6 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.Non-controlling InterestFor consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as non-controlling interests. As of December 31, 2021, our non-controlling interests include those related to the non-ICE limited partners' interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries and non-controlling interest in ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. Prior to completion of the Bakkt transaction on October 15, 2021, our non-controlling interest also included the redeemable non-controlling interest of the non-ICE partners in Bakkt, as discussed further below.The non-ICE limited partners of our CDS clearing subsidiaries hold a 26.7% ownership interest as of December 31, 2021. In addition, during 2020 we received a contribution from a group of minority investors for a non-controlling interest in ICE Futures Abu Dhabi.As of December 31, 2020, minority interests related to Bakkt were reflected as redeemable non-controlling interests in temporary equity within our consolidated balance sheet. On October 15, 2021, Bakkt completed its merger with VIH and as of December 31, 2021, we no longer hold redeemable non-controlling interest related to Bakkt. Refer to Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report.Consolidated Income Tax Provision Consolidated income tax expense was $1.6 billion and $658 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate. The consolidated income tax expense for 2021 was elevated due to the tax expense associated with the gains resulting from our Coinbase and Bakkt transactions. Our effective tax rate was 29% and 24% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2021 is higher than the effective tax rate for 2020 primarily due to the deferred income tax impacts from the U.K. tax law changes as well as the Bakkt transaction. In June 2021, the U.K. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023.On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted and certain income tax related relief was provided under the CARES Act. On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act, or ARPA, was signed into law. The ARPA enacted certain provisions that are relevant to corporate income tax. On November 15, 2021, the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act was signed into law. These provisions did not have a material impact on our income tax provision for 2021 or 2020.See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report, for additional information on these tax items.66Liquidity and Capital Resources Below are charts that reflect our outstanding debt and capital allocation. The acquisition and integration costs in the chart below include cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received for divestitures, cash paid for equity and equity method investments, cash paid for non-controlling interest and redeemable non-controlling interest, and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, in each year.We have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends and the development of our technology platforms. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt, but we 67may also need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities in the future. See “- Future Capital Requirements” below.See “- Cash Flow” below for a discussion of our capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.Consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $607 million and $583 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We had $1.4 billion in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020. We had $145.9 billion and $81.6 billion of cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.As of December 31, 2021, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was $400 million. Due to U.S. tax reform, the majority of our foreign earnings since January 1, 2018 have been subject to immediate U.S. income taxation, and the existing non-U.S. unrestricted cash balance can be distributed to the U.S. in the future with no material additional income tax consequences.Our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. We may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2021, we held $13 million of unrestricted cash that was set aside for legal, regulatory and surveillance operations at NYSE.Cash Flow The following table presents the major components of net changes in cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202120202019Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$3,123 $2,881 $2,659 Investing activities(786)(10,361)(1,740)Financing activities62,026 26,000 (424)Effect of exchange rate changes (6)8 4 Net increase in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds$64,357 $18,528 $499 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, stock based compensation and the effects of changes in working capital.The $242 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2021 from 2020 was driven by an increase of accounts receivable collections of $144 million, primarily due to a prior period COVID-19-related decision to allow customers to defer payment of their 2020 listings invoices. In addition, operating cash increased due to a $2.0 billion increase in net income, adjusted for depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, the gain from the sale of our Coinbase investment, net of taxes, of $892 million, and the gain from the deconsolidation of Bakkt, of $1.4 billion. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in Section 31 fee collections of $219 million, primarily due to lower rates, which were revised in February of each year. The remaining change is due to fluctuations in our working capital and the timing of various payments such as transaction-related expenses and taxes payable on the sale of our Coinbase investment.Investing Activities Consolidated net cash used in investing activities in 2021 primarily relates to $5.1 billion purchases of invested margin deposits, $179 million of capitalized expenditures, $273 million of software development costs, $117 million for the purchase of an equity method investment and $66 million cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by $3.7 billion of proceeds from the sale of invested margin deposits and $1.2 billion in proceeds from the sale of our Coinbase investment. Consolidated net cash used in investing activities in 2020 relates to $9.4 billion cash paid for acquisitions, primarily Ellie Mae, net of cash acquired, $3.4 billion purchases of invested margin deposits, $207 million of capitalized expenditures and $203 million of software development costs, partially offset by $2.8 billion proceeds from the sale of invested margin deposits.68The capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware and software purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements. The software development expenditures primarily relate to the development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms, data services, mortgage services and clearing houses.Financing Activities Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 primarily relates to an increase in our cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty fund balances of $65.7 billion, partially offset by $1.2 billion in repayments of debt facilities, $1.4 billion in net repayments under our Commercial Paper Program, $250 million in repurchases of common stock, $747 million in dividend payments to our stockholders and $70 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises.Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities in 2020 primarily relates to an increase in our cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty fund balances of $19.3 billion, $9.6 billion in net proceeds from the issuance of the May 2020 Notes and the August 2020 Notes, borrowings under a term loan facility and $1.1 billion in net issuances under our Commercial Paper Program. Cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by repayments of our $1.25 billion December 2020 Senior Notes, and the early payoff of the term loan mentioned above, $1.2 billion in repurchases of common stock, $669 million in dividend payments to stockholders and $74 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises.We have adjusted our historical presentation of opening and ending amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statements of cash flows to include cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds. Changes in these balances are reflected as cash provided by/(used in) financing activities.See Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.Debt As of December 31, 2021, we had $13.9 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of $12.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes, $1.0 billion under our U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program and $10 million under credit lines at our ICE India subsidiaries. Our fixed rate senior notes of $12.9 billion have a weighted average maturity of 15 years and a weighted average cost of 2.9% per annum. The commercial paper notes had original maturities ranging from three to 73 days as of December 31, 2021, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.33% per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 26 days. As of December 31, 2020, we had $16.5 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of $12.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes, $1.2 billion of floating rate senior notes, $2.4 billion under the Commercial Paper Program and $6 million under credit lines at our ICE India subsidiaries. Our fixed rate senior notes of $12.9 billion had a weighted average maturity of 16 years and a weighted average cost of 3.0% per annum. The commercial paper notes had original maturities ranging from four to 266 days as of December 31, 2020, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.40% per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 82 days.In September 2021, we used the proceeds from commercial paper issuances and cash on hand to fund the redemption of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due in June 2023, or the Floating Rate Notes. We delivered a notice of redemption of the Floating Rate Notes to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, under the indenture governing the Floating Rate Notes, which was delivered to the holders of the Floating Rate Notes on September 17, 2021, and they were subsequently redeemed on September 27, 2021. In connection with this redemption, we recorded $4 million in accelerated unamortized deferred loan costs, which are included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income for 2021.We have a $3.8 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as primary administrative agent, issuing lender and swing-line lender, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. As of December 31, 2021, of the $3.8 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the Credit Facility, $1.0 billion is required to back-stop the amount outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program and $171 million is required to support certain broker-dealer and other subsidiary commitments. The amount required to backstop the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining $2.6 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, acting as a backstop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program. On October 15, 2021, we agreed with the lenders to extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility to October 15, 2026, among other items.69On August 21, 2020, we entered into a $750 million 18-month senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility with a maturity date of February 21, 2022. We borrowed in full under the facility on September 3, 2020 and the proceeds were used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Ellie Mae acquisition. We had the option to prepay the facility in whole or in part at any time and paid off the full balance of the loan on December 16, 2020. Interest on borrowings under this term loan facility were based on the principal amount outstanding at LIBOR plus an applicable margin, which was equal to 1.125%.On August 20, 2020, we issued $6.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, comprised of $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of floating rate senior notes due in 2023, $1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 0.70% senior notes due in 2023, $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 1.85% senior notes due in 2032, $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.65% senior notes due in 2040, and $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.00% senior notes due in 2060. We used the net proceeds from the offering to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Ellie Mae acquisition.On May 26, 2020, we issued $2.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, comprised of $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.10% senior notes due in 2030 and $1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.00% senior notes due in 2050. We used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including to fund the redemption of our $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.75% senior notes due in December 2020 and to pay down a portion of our commercial paper outstanding.Our Commercial Paper Program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. We had net repayments of $1.4 billion under our Commercial Paper Program during 2021. We used $1.2 billion of proceeds received from the sale of our Coinbase investment to pay down the balance under our Commercial Paper Program.Upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. To mitigate this risk, we maintain the Credit Facility for an aggregate amount which meets or exceeds the amount issued under our Commercial Paper Program at any time. If we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the backstop revolving facility. However, electing to do so would result in higher interest expense.For additional details of our debt instruments, refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.Capital ReturnIn December 2019, our Board approved an aggregate of $2.4 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective January 1, 2020.During 2021, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $250 million on the open market. During 2020, we repurchased 13.6 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $1.2 billion, including 10.4 million shares at a cost of $948 million under our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan and 3.2 million shares at a cost of $299 million on the open market. Shares repurchased are held in treasury stock. We discontinued stock repurchases and terminated our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan in August 2020 in connection with our Ellie Mae acquisition and in November 2021, we resumed repurchases. The remaining balance of Board approved funds for future repurchases as of December 31, 2021 was $903 million. In December 2021, our Board approved an aggregate of $3.15 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective January 1, 2022. The $3.15 billion replaces the previous amount approved by the Board. In December 2021 we entered into a new Rule 10b5-1 trading plan that will become effective in February 2022. We may discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time. The approval of our Board for the stock repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. In addition, our Board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time.From time to time, we enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, as authorized by our Board, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. We expect funding for any stock repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program or our debt facilities. The timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. In making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, management considers multiple factors, including overall stock market conditions, our common stock price performance, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our Board, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash 70flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.During 2021, we paid cash dividends of $1.32 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including quarterly dividends of $0.33 per share, for an aggregate payout of $747 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years. Future Capital Requirements Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases. We currently expect to incur capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between $490 million and $520 million in 2022, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses.As of December 31, 2021, we had $903 million authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details on our stock repurchase program.Our Board has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the Board or the Audit Committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined net income payout ratio. For the first quarter of 2022, we announced a $0.38 per share dividend payable on March 31, 2022 to stockholders of record as of March 17, 2022.Other than the facilities for the ICE Clearing Houses, our Credit Facility and our Commercial Paper Program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties. See Notes 10 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. In the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. However, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. See “-Risk Factors"" and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.Non-GAAP Measures We use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent GAAP measures or that supplement the information provided by our GAAP measures. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this Annual Report, and believe that these measures, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making period-to-period comparisons of results because the adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.The table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders and adjusted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core 71business performance. These measures, including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts), are as follows:Exchanges SegmentFixed Income and Data Services SegmentMortgage Technology SegmentConsolidatedYear Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,202120202019202120202019202120202019202120202019Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses$3,856 $3,631 $3,307 $1,883 $1,810 $1,756 $1,407 $595 $139 $7,146 $6,036 $5,202 Operating expenses1,333 1,242 1,140 1,354 1,318 1,317 1,010 443 72 3,697 3,003 2,529 Less: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles73 74 68 180 191 225 369 123 16 622 388 309 Less: Transaction and integration costs and acquisition-related success fees 59 12 — — — — 39 89 — 98 101 — Less: Impairment of developed software— 11 — — — — — — — — 11 — Less: Impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore— — 31 — — — — — — — — 31 Less: Accrual relating to a regulatory settlement— — — — 8 — — — — — 8 — Adjusted operating expenses$1,201 $1,145 $1,041 $1,174 $1,119 $1,092 $602 $231 $56 $2,977 $2,495 $2,189 Operating income$2,523 $2,389 $2,167 $529 $492 $439 $397 $152 $67 $3,449 $3,033 $2,673 Adjusted operating income$2,655 $2,486 $2,266 $709 $691 $664 $805 $364 $83 $4,169 $3,541 $3,013 Operating margin65 %66 %66 %28 %27 %25 %28 %25 %48 %48 %50 %51 %Adjusted operating margin69 %68 %69 %38 %38 %38 %57 %61 %59 %58 %59 %58 %Net income attributable to ICE common stockholders$4,058 $2,089 $1,933 Add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles622 388 309 Add: Transaction and integration costs and acquisition-related success fees 98 101 — Less: Gain on value of Euroclear equity investment(34)(35)— Less: Gain on sale of Coinbase equity investment(1,227)— — Less: Gain on deconsolidation of Bakkt (1,419)— — Less: Gain on sale of BIDS equity investment— (20)— Less: Gain related to the settlement of an acquisition-related indemnification claim(7)— — Add: Accelerated unamortized costs related to the early payoff of the June 2023 floating rate senior notes4 — — Add: Extinguishment of December 2020 Senior Notes— 14 — Add: Pre-acquisition interest expense on debt issued for Ellie Mae acquisition— 5 — Add: Impairment of developed software— 11 — Add: Impairment of CAT promissory notes— 2 16 Add: Impairment of exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore— — 31 Add: Accrual relating to legal settlement16 30 — Add: Accrual relating to regulatory settlement— 8 — Add/(Less): Net losses/(income) from unconsolidated investees42 (71)(62)Add/(Less): Income tax effect for the above items 574 (109)(80)Add/(Less): Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles183 36 (8)Add: Other tax adjustments— — 3 Adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders$2,910 $2,449 $2,142 Basic earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$7.22 $3.79 $3.44 Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$7.18 $3.77 $3.42 Adjusted basic earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$5.17 $4.44 $3.82 Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$5.15 $4.41 $3.79 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding562 552 561 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding565 555 565 Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-GAAP adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results. Transaction and integration costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. However, we adjust for the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to acquisitions such as Ellie Mae given the magnitude of the $11.4 billion 72purchase price of the acquisition. We also adjust for the acquisition-related transaction costs related to the merger of Bakkt and VIH due to the significance of the transaction. In 2020, we also included a $10 million adjustment for Bridge2 Solutions acquisition costs resulting from a Bakkt incentive award market condition estimation adjustment as an acquisition-related success fee. This adjustment was directly related to the March 2020 capital call to fund the acquisition of Bridge2 Solutions and we believe is therefore appropriate since we exclude costs directly related to the success of a transaction.In 2021, we recorded a $1.2 billion gain on the sale of our Coinbase equity investment and a $1.4 billion gain on the deconsolidation of Bakkt. We do not consider these items to be part of our core business operations.Effective January 1, 2021, we exclude net income from our unconsolidated equity method investees for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures and have retroactively restated the prior-year periods for comparability purposes. For 2021, this adjustment includes our share of net income from OCC, BondLink, and Bakkt (from the period of the Bakkt merger on October 15, 2021 through December 31, 2021). This is consistent with how we treat changes in the fair value of our equity investments. We believe these adjustments provide greater clarity of our performance given that equity investments are non-cash and not a part of our core operations.In addition, we also include the following items as non-GAAP adjustments, as each of these are not considered a part of our core business operations:•2021: The $34 million gain on the fair value adjustment of our Euroclear equity investment;•2021: The $7 million gain related to the settlement of an acquisition-related indemnification claim;•2021: Accrual of $16 million relating to a legal settlement;•2021: The acceleration of unamortized costs of $4 million related to the September 2021 early redemption of our Floating Rate Notes;•2020: The $11 million impairment of software developed at Bakkt when it was our subsidiary since it relates to the build-out of a fundamental software design vs. a recurring upgrade;•2020: Accrual of $30 million relating to a legal settlement;•2020: Accrual of $8 million relating to a regulatory settlement;•2020: The $35 million gain on the fair value adjustment of our Euroclear equity investment; •2020: The extinguishment payment of $14 million related to the June 2020 early redemption of the December 2020 Senior Notes which had an original maturity of December 1, 2020, as a result of our new senior notes offering in May 2020. This included both a make-whole redemption payment and duplicative interest;•2020: The $20 million gain on the sale of our BIDS equity investment;•2020: Pre-acquisition interest expense of $5 million on the August 2020 debt issued to fund a portion of the purchase price of our Ellie Mae acquisition;•2020: Promissory note impairment charges of $2 million on work performed by the original plan processor on the CAT as non-GAAP adjustments (this was in addition to the 2019 accrual of $16 million for the same item). See additional discussion on the CAT in Item 1(A) ""-Risk Factors"" in this Annual Report;•2019: Impairment of exchange registration intangible assets of $31 million at ICE Futures Singapore. This non-cash impairment was a result of the estimated fair value of an acquired intangible asset falling below its carrying value. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.The tax items in non-GAAP adjustments are either the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments or tax items as described below that are not in the normal course of business and are not indicative of our core business performance. The following tax-related items are included as non-GAAP adjustments:•Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles, including the impact of U.K. and U.S. state tax law changes and apportionment updates, as well as other foreign tax law changes which resulted in deferred tax expense/(benefit) of $183 million, $36 million and ($8 million) in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The deferred tax adjustments in 2021 relate primarily to the U.K. tax law changes enacted in June 2021, which increased the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023. The deferred tax adjustments in 2020 were due to the tax law changes enacted in July 2020, which increased the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% effective April 1, 2020, as well as impacts of U.S. state apportionment charges.•Other tax adjustments of $3 million in 2019 for audit settlement payments primarily related to pre-acquisition tax matters in connection with our acquisition of NYSE in 2013.For additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and “- Recent Developments,” “- Consolidated Operating Expenses”, “- Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” and “-Consolidated Income Tax Provision” above.73Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As described in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, certain clearing house collateral is reported off-balance sheet. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments We intend to fund our contractual obligations and commercial commitments from existing cash and cash flow from operations. As of December 31, 2021, our primary cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.As of December 31, 2021, we had $13.9 billion in outstanding debt, including $1.5 billion of short-term debt. Our outstanding debt consists of $12.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes, $1.0 billion under our U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program and $10 million under credit lines at our ICE India subsidiaries.Our operating leases primarily relate to our leased office space and data center facilities, and as of December 31, 2021, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $350 million, with $82 million payable within one-year.We have other purchase obligations to purchase various goods and services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding.In addition, we have $150.4 billion in cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin. Clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. The cash and cash equivalent deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ICE NGX administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. It has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physically-settled contract, each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin.We also have unrecognized tax benefits, or UTBs. As of December 31, 2021, our cumulative UTBs were $229 million, and accrued interest and penalties related to UTBs were $49 million. We are under examination by various tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. It is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our UTBs. As of December 31, 2021, we, through NYSE, have net obligations of $103 million related to our pension and other benefit programs. The date of payment under these net obligations cannot be determined. See Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs. In addition, the future funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT is ultimately expected to be provided by both the SROs and broker-dealers. To date, however, funding has been provided solely by the SROs, and future funding is expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the SEC and subsequently collected by industry members. See ""- Non-GAAP Measures"" above.New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. 74Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and re-evaluate them on a periodic basis. Based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. The values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets, including identified intangible assets. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, trademarks, technology, trading products, data, exchange registrations, backlog, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments and estimates may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not. In performing the allocation of the acquisitions' purchase price to assets and liabilities, we consider, among other factors, the intended use of the acquired assets, analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. At the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. We continue to review and assess our estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by GAAP, which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Estimation uncertainty may exist due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of an acquired business in our discounted cash flow models. Significant assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and expense synergies that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate.Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, and we have identified four reporting units, which were updated in 2020 to reflect our new segment presentation. Our reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the NYSE, Other Exchanges, Fixed Income and Data Services, and Mortgage Technology reporting units. These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, or ASU-2017, for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the fair value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference. Alternatively, we may choose to bypass the qualitative option and perform quantitative testing to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value. For our goodwill impairment testing, we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach. For our testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches.75Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. These estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the determination of fair value and/or impairment. During 2019, we recorded an impairment charge of $31 million on the remaining value of exchange registration intangible assets on ICE Futures Singapore as a result of a decrease in fair value determined during our annual impairment testing. We did not record any impairments in 2021 or 2020 as a result of our goodwill or indefinite-lived impairment testing.We are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. If an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. Fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis. Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., U.K. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.The FASB Staff has provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. We have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred.We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.We operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. 76ITEM 7 (A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents were $2.0 billion for both periods, of which $276 million and $245 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or Canadian dollars, and the remaining amounts are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. A hypothetical 50% decrease in short-term interest rates would have an immaterial impact on our annual pre-tax earnings as of December 31, 2021, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2021, we had $13.9 billion in outstanding debt, of which $12.9 billion relates to our fixed rate senior notes. The remaining amount outstanding of $1.0 billion relates to $1.0 billion outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program, which bears interest at fluctuating rates, and $10 million under lines of credit at our India subsidiaries. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates relating to the amounts under our Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2021 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $10 million, assuming no change in the volume or composition of our outstanding indebtedness and no hedging activity. See Part II, Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Debt,"" and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. The interest rates on our Commercial Paper Program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. The weighted average interest rate on our Commercial Paper Program decreased from 0.40% as of December 31, 2020 to 0.33% as of December 31, 2021. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in short-term interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk As an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling, Canadian dollars or euros, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. Certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. Our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2021 and 2020 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates): 77 Year Ended December 31, 2021Year Ended December 31, 2020 Pound Sterling EuroPound Sterling EuroAverage exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the current year$1.3762 $1.1835 $1.2832 $1.1412 Average exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the prior year$1.2832 $1.1412 $1.2769 $1.1195 Average exchange rate increase (decrease)7 %4 %— %2 %Foreign denominated percentage of: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses7 %6 %7 %6 %Operating expenses8 %2 %9 %2 %Operating income6 %11 %6 %9 %Impact of the currency fluctuations (1) on: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses$31 $13 $1 $6 Operating expenses$19 $3 $1 $1 Operating income$12 $10 $— $5 (1) Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.We have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. In both 2021 and 2020, 13% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and in 2021 and 2020, 10% and 11%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.Foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables occurs through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $13 million and $5 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively inclusive of the impact of foreign currency hedging transactions. The foreign currency transaction losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. A 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2021, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity, would result in a foreign currency loss of $15 million.We entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2021 and 2020 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. Although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities. We have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. Our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): As of December 31, 2021 Position in pounds sterlingPosition in Canadian dollarsPosition in eurosAssets£722 C$2,245 €220 of which goodwill represents566 398 92 Liabilities78 1,826 48 Net currency position£644 C$419 €172 Net currency position, in $USD$871 $331 $195 Negative impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates$87 $33 $20 Foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) within our balance sheet. See the table below for the portion of equity attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments as well as the activity by year included within our statement of other comprehensive income. The impact of 78the foreign currency exchange rate differences in the table below were primarily driven by fluctuations of the pound sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar which were 1.3524, 1.3665 and 1.3260 as of December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments, monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests. Clearing House Cash Deposit RisksThe ICE Clearing Houses hold material amounts of clearing member margin deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. Refer to Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ICE Clearing Houses' cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts receivable and unsettled variation margin which were $150.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the ICE Clearing Houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the clearing members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated:•Credit Risk: When a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. Credit risk is managed by using exposure limits depending on the credit profile of the counterparty as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. Our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. We seek to substantially mitigate the credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.•Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and at the right time. To mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.•Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value. Our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term 79investments. For example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. In addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, U.S. Treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (Euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities. •Security Issuer Risk: Security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments. •Investment Counterparty Risk: Investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers. When engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house control. Additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. The typical haircut for high quality sovereign debt is 2% of the reverse repurchase amount which provides additional excess collateral. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty’s obligation.The ICE Clearing Houses may use third-party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house. Such advisors do not hold clearing member cash or cash equivalent deposits or the underlying investments. Clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians. The ICE Clearing Houses employ (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.•Cross-Currency Margin Deposit Risk: Each of the ICE Clearing Houses may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in U.S. dollars to secure a Euro margin obligation). The ICE Clearing Houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility. Cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.Impact of InflationWe have not been adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. In the event of inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.80",2023-12-30 20:40:12.977481
1571949,ICE,"Intercontinental Exchange, Inc.",2023,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K, which was filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on February 3, 2022. Overview We are a provider of market infrastructure, data services and technology solutions to a broad range of customers including financial institutions, corporations and government entities. These products, which span major asset classes including futures, equities, fixed income and U.S. residential mortgages, provide our customers with access to mission critical tools that are designed to increase asset class transparency and workflow efficiency. The majority of our identifiable assets are located in the U.S. and U.K. We report our results in the following three segments:•Exchanges: We operate regulated marketplaces for the listing, trading and clearing of a broad array of derivatives contracts and financial securities.•Fixed Income and Data Services: We provide fixed income pricing, reference data, indices, analytics and execution services as well as global CDS clearing and multi-asset class data delivery solutions.•Mortgage Technology: We provide a technology platform that offers customers comprehensive, digital workflow tools that aim to address the inefficiencies that exist in the U.S. residential mortgage market, from application through closing and the secondary market.Recent Developments Pending Acquisition of Black Knight, Inc.On May 4, 2022, we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Black Knight, Inc., or Black Knight, a software, data and analytics company that serves the housing finance continuum, including real estate data, mortgage lending and servicing, as well as the secondary markets. Pursuant to that certain Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 4, 2022, among ICE, Sand Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE, or Sub, and Black Knight, which we refer to as the “merger agreement,” Sub will merge with and into Black Knight, which we refer to as the “merger,” with Black Knight surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ICE. As of May 4, 2022, the transaction was valued at approximately $13.1 billion, or $85 per share of Black Knight common stock, with cash comprising 80% of the value of the aggregate transaction consideration and shares of our common stock comprising 20% of the value of the 44aggregate transaction consideration at that time. The aggregate cash component of the transaction consideration is fixed at $10.5 billion, and the value of the aggregate stock component of the transaction consideration will fluctuate with the market price of our common stock and will be determined based on the average of the volume weighted averages of the trading prices of our common stock on each of the ten consecutive trading days ending three trading days prior to the closing of the merger. This transaction builds on our position as a provider of electronic workflow solutions for the rapidly evolving U.S. residential mortgage industry.Black Knight provides a comprehensive and integrated ecosystem of software, data and analytics solutions serving the real estate and housing finance markets. We believe the Black Knight ecosystem adds value for clients of all sizes across the mortgage and real estate lifecycles by helping organizations lower costs, increase efficiencies, grow their businesses, and reduce risk.On August 19, 2022, our preliminary proxy statement/prospectus on Form S-4 was declared effective by the SEC, and on September 21, 2022, Black Knight stockholders approved the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2023 following the receipt of regulatory approvals and the satisfaction of customary closing conditions.Global Market Conditions Our results of operations are affected by global economic conditions, including macroeconomic conditions and geopolitical events or conflicts. During 2022, macroeconomic conditions, including rising interest rates, recent spikes in inflation rates and market volatility, along with geopolitical concerns, including the war in Ukraine and the sanctions and other measures that have been and continue to be imposed in response to the war, created uncertainty and volatility in the global economy and resulted in a dynamic operating environment. Our business has been impacted positively and negatively by these global economic conditions. For instance, due to market volatility and rising interest rates, we have seen increased trading across a number of our products, such as interest rate and equity futures, credit default swaps and bonds. Conversely, increases in mortgage interest rates in 2022 have resulted in reduced consumer and investor demand for mortgages and adversely impacted the transaction-based revenues in our Mortgage Technology segment.We have suspended all services in Russia except for limited offerings to non-sanctioned entities. From an operational perspective, our businesses, including our exchanges, clearing houses, listings venues, data services businesses and mortgage platforms, have not suffered a material negative impact as a result of these events in Ukraine and the surrounding region. We expect the macro environment to remain dynamic in the near-term, and we continue to monitor macroeconomic conditions, including interest rates and inflation rates, as well as the uncertainty surrounding the extent and duration of the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and the impact that any of the foregoing may have on the global economy and on our business.Tax Policy ChangesIn July and August 2022, the CHIPS and Science Act, or CHIPS, and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, were signed into law. The IRA introduced a 15% corporate alternative minimum tax, or CAMT, on adjusted financial statement income for corporations with profits in excess of $1 billion, effective for tax years after December 31, 2022. While further guidance on the implementation of the CAMT is expected, we do not expect it will have a material impact to our 2023 effective tax rate. We also do not expect that CHIPS will have a material impact. The IRA also includes a stock buyback excise tax of 1% on share repurchases, which will apply to net stock buybacks after December 31, 2022. We do not expect this to have a material impact once share repurchases are resumed.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD/G20, has proposed the introduction of a global minimum tax rate at 15%. Consultations are ongoing and while we expect increased tax compliance requirements, we do not expect a material impact to our effective tax rate given our current tax profile.45Consolidated Financial HighlightsThe following summarizes our results and significant changes in our consolidated financial performance for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except per share amounts): 46Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,20222021Change20212020ChangeRevenues, less transaction-based expenses $7,292 $7,146 2 %$7,146 $6,036 18 % Recurring revenues(1)$3,721 $3,509 6 %$3,509 $2,923 20 % Transaction revenues, net(1)$3,571 $3,637 (2)%$3,637 $3,113 17 %Operating expenses $3,654 $3,697 (1)%$3,697 $3,003 23 %Adjusted operating expenses(2)$2,953 $2,977 (1)%$2,977 $2,495 19 %Operating income $3,638 $3,449 5 %$3,449 $3,033 14 %Adjusted operating income(2)$4,339 $4,169 4 %$4,169 $3,541 18 %Operating margin 50 %48 %2 pts48 %50 %(2 pts)Adjusted operating margin(2)59 %58 %1 pt58 %59 %(1 pt)Other income/(expense), net $(1,830)$2,249 n/a$2,249 $(267)n/aIncome tax expense$310 $1,629 (81)%$1,629 $658 148 %Effective tax rate 17 %29 %(12 pts)29 %24 %5 ptsNet income attributable to ICE$1,446 $4,058 (64)%$4,058 $2,089 94 %Adjusted net income attributable to ICE(2)$2,974 $2,863 4 %$2,863 $2,449 17 %Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$2.58 $7.18 (64)%$7.18 $3.77 90 %Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders(2)$5.30 $5.06 5 %$5.06 $4.41 15 %Cash flows from operating activities$3,554 $3,123 14 %$3,123 $2,881 8 %*Percentage changes in the table above deemed ""n/a"" are not meaningful.(1) We define recurring revenues as the portion of our revenues that are generally predictable, stable, and can be expected to occur at regular intervals in the future with a relatively high degree of certainty and visibility. We define transaction revenues as those associated with a more specific point-in-time service, such as trade execution.(2) The adjusted figures exclude items that are not reflective of our ongoing core operations and business performance. Adjusted net income attributable to ICE and adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders are presented net of taxes. These adjusted figures are not calculated in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, or GAAP. See “- Non-GAAP Financial Measures” below.•Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $146 million in 2022 from 2021. The increase in revenues includes $115 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2022 from 2021.•Revenues, less transaction-based expenses, increased $1.1 billion in 2021 from 2020. The increase in revenues includes $44 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2021 from 2020. •Operating expenses decreased $43 million in 2022 from 2021. The decrease in operating expenses includes $38 million in favorable foreign exchange effects arising from the stronger U.S. dollar in 2022 from 2021.•Operating expenses increased $694 million in 2021 from 2020. The increase in operating expenses includes $22 million in unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from the weaker U.S. dollar in 2021 from 2020.•Other income/(expense), net, in 2022 primarily includes our share of estimated equity method investment losses and an impairment charge on our investment in Bakkt to its fair value, of $1.4 billion, a net gain on the sale of our Euroclear plc, or Euroclear, stake of $41 million, interest income of $108 million and interest expense of $616 million.•Other income/(expense), net, in 2021 primarily includes our gain on the Bakkt transaction of $1.4 billion, our gain on the sale of our Coinbase Global, Inc., or Coinbase, investment of $1.2 billion, equity earnings in OCC of $51 million, estimated equity losses in our investment in Bakkt during the post-merger period of $92 million, dividend income from Euroclear plc, or Euroclear, of $60 million, a fair value adjustment gain on our Euroclear investment of $34 million and interest expense of $423 million.•The effective tax rate in 2022 was lower than the effective tax rate in 2021 primarily due to the deferred income tax benefit from the impairment to our equity method investment in Bakkt in the current year, and the deferred income tax expense from the U.K. tax law changes in the prior year.47•The effective tax rate in 2021 was higher than the effective tax rate in 2020 primarily due to the deferred income tax impacts resulting from the U.K. tax law changes. In 2021, the U.K. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023. In 2020, the UK enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 17% to 19% effective April 1, 2020.Business Environment and Market TrendsOur business environment has been characterized by:•globalization of marketplaces, customers and competitors;•growing customer demand for workflow efficiency and automation; •commodity, interest rate, inflation rate and financial markets volatility and uncertainty;•growing demand for data to inform customers' risk management and investment decisions;•evolving, increasing and disparate regulation across multiple jurisdictions;•price volatility increasing customers' demand for risk management services;•increasing focus on capital and cost efficiencies;•customers' preference to manage risk in markets demonstrating the greatest depth of liquidity and product diversity;•the evolution of existing products and new product innovation to serve emerging customer needs and changing industry agreements;•rising demand for speed, data, data capacity and connectivity by market participants, necessitating increased investment in technology; and•consolidation and increasing competition among global markets for trading, clearing and listings.Recent changes with regard to global financial reform have emphasized the importance of transparent markets, centralized clearing and access to data, all of which are important aspects of our product offering. However, some of the proposed rules have yet to be implemented and some rules that have already been partially implemented are being reconsidered. In addition, some of the global regulations have not been fully harmonized and several non-U.S. regulations are inconsistent with U.S. rules. As the evolution continues, legislative and regulatory actions may change the way we conduct our business and may create uncertainty for market participants, which could affect trading volumes or demand for market data. As a result, it is difficult to predict all of the effects that the legislation and its implementing regulations will have on us. As discussed more fully in Item 1 “- Business - Regulation” included in this Annual Report, Brexit, MiFID II and other regulations have resulted in operational, regulatory and/or business risk.We have diversified our business so that we are not dependent on volatility or transaction activity in any one asset class. In addition, we have increased our portion of recurring revenues from 34% in 2014 to 51% in 2022. These recurring revenues include data services, listings and various mortgage technology solutions.Many of the data products we sell and services we provide are required for our clients’ business operations regardless of market volatility or shifts in business profitability levels. We anticipate that there will continue to be growth in the financial information services sector driven by a number of global trends, including the following: •increasing global regulatory demands; •greater use of fair value accounting standards and reliance on independent valuations; •greater emphasis on risk management; •market fragmentation driven by regulatory changes; •the move to passive investing and indexation; •ongoing growth in the size and diversity of financial markets; •increased automation of fixed income, mortgage and other less automated markets; •the development of new data products; •the demand for greater data capacity and connectivity; •new entrants; and •increasing demand for outsourced services by financial institutions.We continue to focus on our strategy to grow each of our revenue streams, and prudently manage expenses, in order to mitigate these uncertainties and to build on our growth opportunities by leveraging our proprietary data, clearing, markets and technology solutions.48Segment ResultsOur business is conducted through three reportable business segments: Exchanges, Fixed Income and Data Services and Mortgage Technology. Segments are discussed more in detail in ""Item 1- Business"". While revenues are recorded specifically in the segment in which they are earned or to which they relate, a significant portion of our operating expenses are not solely related to a specific segment because the expenses serve functions that are necessary for the operation of more than one segment. We directly allocate expenses when reasonably possible to do so. Otherwise, we use a pro-rata revenue approach as the allocation method for the expenses that do not relate solely to one segment and serve functions that are necessary for the operation of all segments. Our segments do not engage in intersegment transactions.For details on trends in recent prior-year periods, refer to our 2021 and 2020 Annual Reports on Form 10-K.Exchanges SegmentThe following presents selected statements of income data for our Exchanges segment (dollars in millions):49(1) The adjusted figures in the charts above are calculated by excluding items that are not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. As a result, these adjusted figures are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Transaction and clearing revenues consist of fees collected from derivatives, cash equities and equity options trading and derivatives clearing, and are reported on a net basis, except for the NYSE transaction-based expenses discussed below. Rates per-contract, or RPC, are driven by the number of contracts or securities traded and the fees charged per contract, net of certain rebates. Our per-contract transaction and clearing revenues will depend upon many factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, transaction and clearing volume, product mix, pricing, applicable revenue sharing and market making agreements, and new product introductions.50Transaction and clearing revenues are generally assessed on a per-contract basis and revenues and profitability fluctuate with changes in contract volume and product mix. We consider data and connectivity services revenues and listings revenues to be recurring revenues. Our data and connectivity services revenues are recurring subscription fees related to the various data and connectivity services that we provide which are directly attributable to our exchange venues. Our listings revenues are also recurring subscription fees that we earn for the provision of NYSE listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies.In 2022 and 2021, 18% and 17%, respectively, of our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were billed in pounds sterling or euros. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar, our Exchanges segment revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were lower by $87 million in 2022 from 2021.Our exchange transaction and clearing revenues are presented net of rebates. We recorded rebates of $869 million and $1.0 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. We offer rebates in certain of our markets primarily to support market liquidity and trading volume by providing qualified participants in those markets a discount to the applicable commission rate. Such rebates are calculated based on volumes traded. The decrease in rebates is primarily due to lower volumes as compared to the prior year and the migration of Sterling futures rebates into the Sterling Overnight Index Average, or SONIA, and a change in the pricing and structure of SONIA products.•Energy Futures and Options: Total energy volume decreased 4% and revenues decreased 6% in 2022 from 2021.–Total oil futures and options volume decreased 12% in 2022 from 2021 driven, in part, by lower Gasoil volumes which are impacted by the uncertainty around Russian sanctions and the conflict in Ukraine.–Our global natural gas futures and options volume increased 16% in 2022 from 2021 as 2022 benefited from elevated price volatility related to geopolitical events, including the conflict in Ukraine.–Our environmentals and other futures and options volume decreased 12% in 2022 from 2021 with growth in U.S. environmental volumes offset by lower EU environmental volumes.•Agricultural and Metals Futures and Options: Total volume in our agricultural and metals futures and options markets increased 5% and revenues increased 3% in 2022 from 2021. The overall increase in agricultural volumes was due to 2022 benefiting from elevated price volatility and price inflation driving an increased need to manage risk across our commodity markets.–Sugar futures and options volumes increased 5% in 2022 from 2021. –Other agricultural and metal futures and options volumes increased 4% in 2022 from 2021. •Financial Futures and Options: Total volume increased 2% and revenues increased 21% in our financial futures and options markets in 2022 from 2021. Adjusting for the transition of the LIBOR-based Sterling contract to the alternative rate-based SONIA contract, which is half the notional size of the Sterling contract, total volume in our financial futures and options markets increased 19% in 2022. 2022 benefited from elevated volatility across global markets driven by geopolitical events, central bank activity and inflationary concerns.–Interest rate futures and options volume decreased 1% and revenue increased 23%, respectively, in 2022 from 2021. Adjusting for the transition of the LIBOR-based Sterling contract to the alternative rate-based SONIA contract, which is half the notional size of the Sterling contract, interest rate volumes increased 20% in 2022 from 2021 driven by interest rate volatility and increased speculation of central bank activity due to inflation concerns. Interest rate futures and options revenues were $292 million and $237 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.–Other financial futures and options volume, which includes our MSCI®, FTSE® and NYSE FANG+ equity index products, increased 15% and revenue increased 16% in 2022 from 2021. 2022 benefited from elevated volatility across global equity markets driven by geopolitical events, central bank activity and inflationary concerns. Other financial futures and options revenues were $183 million and $157 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.•Cash Equities and Equity Options: Cash equities volume increased 4% in 2022 from 2021 due to higher market volumes driven by elevated volatility related to inflationary, recessionary and geopolitical concerns. Cash equities revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $275 million and $246 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. Equity options volume increased 6% in 2022 from 2021 driven by increased participation and higher market share. 51Equity options revenues, net of transaction-based expenses, were $103 million and $109 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.•OTC and Other: OTC and other transactions include revenues from our OTC energy business and other trade confirmation services, as well as interest income on certain clearing margin deposits, regulatory penalties and fines, fees for use of our facilities, regulatory fees charged to member organizations of our U.S. securities exchanges, designated market maker service fees, exchange membership fees and agricultural grading and certification fees. Our OTC and other revenues increased 31% in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to an increase in interest income on clearing margin deposits. Following the October 2021 Bakkt transaction, Bakkt revenues are no longer included within our OTC and other revenues.•Data and Connectivity Services: Our data and connectivity services revenues increased 5% in 2022 from 2021. The increase in revenue was driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers and increased purchases by existing customers.•Listings Revenues: Through NYSE, NYSE American and NYSE Arca, we generate listings revenue related to the provision of listings services for public companies and ETFs, and related corporate actions for listed companies. Listings revenues increased 7% in 2022 from 2021, driven by the full impact of strong equity capital markets activity in 2021.Listings revenues in our securities markets arise from fees applicable to companies listed on our cash equities exchanges– original listing fees and annual listing fees. Original listing fees consist of two components: initial listing fees and fees related to corporate actions. Initial listing fees, subject to a minimum and maximum amount, are based on the number of shares that a company initially lists. All listings fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time. Revenue related to the investor relations performance obligation is recognized ratably over the period these services are provided, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.In addition, we earn corporate actions-related listing fees in connection with actions involving the issuance of new shares, such as stock splits, rights issues and sales of additional securities, as well as mergers and acquisitions. Listings fees related to other corporate actions are considered contract modifications of our listing contracts and are recognized ratably over time as customers continue to list on our exchanges.In 2022, NYSE listed over $345 billion in total market value from IPOs, including three of the top five operating company IPOs defined by offering proceeds raised, follow-on offerings and over 30 transfers from competing exchanges, an increase of 56% from $221 billion raised in 2021.Selected Operating DataManagement considers volume metrics when making financial and operating decisions, and believes volumes are useful for management and investors in understanding the performance of our exchanges business.

Open interest refers to the total number of contracts that are currently “open,” – in other words, contracts that have been entered into but not yet liquidated by either an offsetting trade, exercise, expiration or assignment. Open interest is also a measure of the future activity remaining to be closed out in terms of the number of contracts that members and their clients continue to hold in the particular contract and by the number of contracts held for each contract month listed by the exchange.

Matched volume represents the total number of shares of equity securities, ETFs and crossing session activity executed on our exchanges.Transaction-Based Expenses Our equities and equity options markets pay fees to the SEC pursuant to Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31 fees are recorded on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. These Section 31 fees are assessed to recover the government’s costs of supervising and regulating the securities markets and professionals and are subject to change. We, in turn, collect corresponding activity assessment fees from member organizations clearing or settling trades on the equities and options exchanges, and recognize these amounts in our transaction and clearing revenues when invoiced. The activity assessment fees are designed to equal the Section 31 fees. As a result, activity assessment fees and the corresponding Section 31 fees do not have an impact on our net income, although the timing of payment by us will vary from collections. Section 31 fees were $499 million and $248 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in Section 31 fees was primarily due to an increase in rates. The fees we collect are included in cash at the time of receipt and we remit the amounts to the SEC semi-annually as required. The total amount is included in accrued liabilities and was $223 million as of December 31, 2022.We make liquidity payments to cash and options trading customers, as well as routing charges made to other exchanges which are included in transaction-based expenses. We incur routing charges when we do not have the best bid or offer in the market for a security that a customer is trying to buy or sell on one of our securities exchanges. In that case, we route the customer’s order to the external market center that displays the best bid or offer. The external market center charges us a fee per share (denominated in tenths of a cent per share) for routing to its system. We record routing charges on a gross basis as a component of transaction and clearing fee revenue. Cash liquidity payments, routing and clearing fees were $1.8 billion in both 2022 and 2021.Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginThe following chart summarizes our Exchanges segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions).

In 2022 and 2021, 11% and 14%, respectively, of our Fixed Income and Data Services segment revenues were billed in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly. Due to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro compared to the U.S. dollar during 2022, our Fixed Income and Data Services revenues were lower by $28 million in 2022 than in 2021.Fixed Income and Data Services RevenuesOur Fixed Income and Data Services revenues increased 11% in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to strength in our fixed income execution and CDS clearing businesses due to elevated volatility across global markets driven by geopolitical events, central bank activity and inflationary concerns.•Fixed Income Execution: Fixed income execution includes revenues from ICE Bonds. Execution fees are reported net of rebates, which were nominal in 2022 and 2021. Our fixed income execution revenues increased 96% in 2022 from 2021 due to elevated volatility across global markets driven by geopolitical events, central bank activity and inflationary concerns.•CDS Clearing: CDS clearing revenues increased 59% in 2022 from 2021. The notional value of CDS cleared was $23.8 trillion and $17.0 trillion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increases in the notional value of CDS cleared were primarily driven by heightened volatility related to geopolitical events and inflationary concerns.•Fixed Income Data and Analytics: Our fixed income data and analytics revenues increased 1% in 2022 from 2021. The increase in revenues was due to strength in our index business during the first half of 2022 and continued growth in our pricing and reference data business driven by the strong retention rate of existing customers, the addition of new customers, and increased purchases by existing customers. This was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange effects arising from fluctuations of the U.S. dollar as compared to 2021.•Other Data and Network Services: Our other data and network services revenues increased 6% in 2022 from 2021. The increase in revenues was driven primarily by growth in our ICE Global Network offering, coupled with increased demand and strong retention in our consolidated feeds business, and strength in our derivatives analytics and desktop revenues.Annual Subscription Value, or ASV, represents, at a point in time, the data services revenues, which includes Fixed Income Data and Analytics as well as other data and network services, subscribed for the succeeding 12 months. ASV does not include new sales, contract terminations or price changes that may occur during that 12-month period. However, while it is an indicative forward-looking metric, it does not provide a precise growth forecast of the next 12 months of data 57services revenues. Management considers ASV metrics when making financial and operating decisions, and believes ASV is useful for management and investors in understanding our data services business performance.As of December 31, 2022, ASV was $1.682 billion, which increased 2.2% compared to the ASV as of December 31, 2021. ASV represents nearly 100% of total data services revenues for this segment. This does not adjust for year-over-year foreign exchange fluctuations.Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating MarginThe following chart summarizes our Fixed Income and Data Services segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions).

Each revenue classification above contains a mix of recurring and transaction revenues, based on the various service offerings described in more detail below.Mortgage Technology RevenuesOur mortgage technology revenues are derived from our comprehensive U.S. residential mortgage platform. Our mortgage technology business is intended to enable greater workflow efficiency for customers focused on originating U.S. residential mortgage loans. Mortgage technology revenues decreased $278 million or 20% in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to lower mortgage origination volumes driven by rising interest rates.•Origination technology: Our origination technology revenues decreased 22% in 2022 from 2021 due to lower transaction-based revenues as mortgage origination volumes declined during 2022. Our origination technology acts as a system of record for the mortgage transaction, automating the gathering, reviewing, and verifying of mortgage-related information and enabling automated enforcement of rules and business practices designed to help ensure that each completed loan transaction is of high quality and adheres to secondary market standards. These revenues are based on recurring Software as a Service, or SaaS, subscription fees, with an additive transaction-based or success-based pricing fee as lenders exceed the number of loans closed that are included with their monthly base subscription.In addition, the ICE Mortgage Technology network provides originators connectivity to the mortgage supply chain and facilitates the secure exchange of information between our customers and a broad ecosystem of third-party service providers, as well as lenders and investors that are critical to consummating the millions of loan transactions that occur on our origination network each year. Revenue from the ICE Mortgage Technology network is largely transaction-based.•Closing solutions: Our closing solutions revenues decreased 26% in 2022 from 2021 due to lower mortgage origination volumes. Our closing solutions connect key participants, such as lenders, title and settlement agents and individual county recorders, to digitize the closing and recording process. Closing solutions also include revenues from our MERSCORP Holdings, Inc., or MERS database, which provides a system of record for recording and tracking changes and servicing rights and beneficial ownership interests in loans secured by U.S. residential real estate. Revenues from closing solutions are largely transaction-based and are based on the volume of loans closed.•Data and Analytics: Our Data and Analytics revenues increased 24% in 2022 from 2021 due to the addition of new customers in our Automation, Intelligence, Quality, or AIQ, and data businesses. Revenues include those related to ICE Mortgage Technology’s AIQ offering, which applies machine learning to the entire loan origination process, offering customers greater efficiency by streamlining data collection and validation through our automated document recognition and data extraction capabilities. AIQ revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature. In addition, our data offerings include real-time industry and peer benchmarking tools, which provide originators a granular view into the real-time trends of the U.S. residential mortgage market. We also provide a Data as a Service, or DaaS, offering through private data clouds for lenders to access their own data and origination information. Revenues related to our data products are largely subscription-based and recurring in nature.60•Other: Other revenues decreased 3% in 2022 from 2021 due to lower professional services and non-mortgage consumer engagement revenue. Other revenues include professional services fees, as well as revenues from ancillary products. Other revenues can be both recurring and transaction-based in nature.Operating Expenses, Operating Income and Operating Margin The following chart summarizes our Mortgage Technology segment's operating expenses, operating income and operating margin (dollars in millions).

Due to fluctuations in the U.S. dollar compared to the pound sterling and euro, our consolidated operating expenses were $38 million lower in 2022 than in 2021. See Item 7(A) “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk - Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” below for additional information.Compensation and Benefits Expenses Compensation and benefits expense is our most significant operating expense and includes non-capitalized employee wages, bonuses, non-cash or stock compensation, certain severance costs, benefits and employer taxes. The bonus component of our compensation and benefits expense is based on both our financial performance and individual employee performance. The performance-based restricted stock compensation expense is also based on our financial performance. Therefore, our compensation and benefits expense will vary year-to-year based on our financial performance and fluctuations in our number of employees. The below chart summarizes the significant drivers of our compensation and benefits expense results for the periods presented (dollars in millions, except employee headcount).Year Ended December 31,20222021ChangeEmployee headcount 8,911 8,858 1 %Stock-based compensation expenses$149 $155 (4)%Employee headcount increased in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to recent acquisitions and a shift to move certain costs in-house, primarily in India.Compensation and benefits expense decreased $55 million in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to $54 million in expenses related to Bakkt prior to deconsolidation in 2021. Compensation expense includes higher costs from increased headcount, annual merit increases and other related costs, offset by lower bonus expense in 2022 due to lower target performance as compared to the above-target performance in 2021. Stock-based compensation expenses decreased in 2022 due to the deconsolidation of Bakkt and lower target performance in 2022 as compared to the above-target performance in 2021.Professional Services Expenses Professional services expense includes fees for consulting services received on strategic and technology initiatives, temporary labor, as well as regulatory, legal and accounting fees, and may fluctuate as a result of changes in our use of these services in our business. Professional services expenses decreased $28 million in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to lower regulatory and litigation expenses, lower consulting expenses related to bringing certain mortgage technology-related costs in-house, and $13 million in expenses recorded at Bakkt in 2021 prior to deconsolidation.Acquisition-Related Transaction and Integration CostsIn 2022, we incurred $93 million in acquisition-related transaction costs primarily due legal and consulting expenses related to our pending acquisition of Black Knight and our integration of Ellie Mae.We expect to continue to explore and pursue various potential acquisitions and other strategic opportunities to strengthen our competitive position and support our growth. As a result, we may incur acquisition-related transaction costs in future periods.63Technology and Communication Expenses Technology support services consist of costs for running our wholly-owned data centers, hosting costs paid to third-party data centers, and maintenance of our computer hardware and software required to support our technology and cybersecurity. These costs are driven by system capacity, functionality and redundancy requirements. Communication expenses consist of costs for network connections for our electronic platforms and telecommunications costs.Technology and communications expense also includes fees paid for access to external market data, licensing and other fee agreement expenses. Technology and communications expenses may be impacted by growth in electronic contract volume, our capacity requirements, changes in the number of telecommunications hubs and connections with customers to access our electronic platforms directly. Technology and communications expenses increased by $17 million in 2022 from 2021, primarily due to increased hardware and software support costs, increased hosting costs and increased data services costs, partially offset by $11 million in expenses in 2021 related to Bakkt prior to deconsolidation.Rent and Occupancy ExpensesRent and occupancy expense relates to leased and owned property and includes rent, maintenance, real estate taxes, utilities and other related costs. We have significant operations located in the U.S., U.K., and India, with smaller offices located throughout the world.Rent and occupancy expenses included decreased rent expense in 2022 from 2021 due to office closures, and expenses in 2021 related to Bakkt prior to deconsolidation. These costs were partially offset by higher costs related to utilities, repairs and maintenance as more employees returned to the office. See Item 2 “- Properties” above for additional information regarding our leased and owned property.Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include marketing, advertising, public relations, insurance, bank service charges, dues and subscriptions, travel and entertainment, non-income taxes and other general and administrative costs.Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2022 from 2021, primarily due to increased marketing expenses related to additional branding efforts and increased travel and entertainment expenses compared to suppressed travel demand in 2021 as a result of COVID-19. These were partially offset by $19 million in expenses related to Bakkt in 2021 prior to deconsolidation.Depreciation and Amortization Expenses Depreciation and amortization expense results from depreciation of long-lived assets such as buildings, leasehold improvements, aircraft, hardware and networking equipment, software, furniture, fixtures and equipment over their estimated useful lives. This expense includes amortization of intangible assets obtained in our acquisitions of businesses, as well as on various licensing agreements, over their estimated useful lives. Intangible assets subject to amortization consist primarily of customer relationships, trading products with finite lives and technology. This expense also includes amortization of internally-developed and purchased software over its estimated useful life.We recorded amortization expenses on intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisitions, as well as on other intangible assets, of $610 million and $622 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.We recorded depreciation expenses on our fixed assets of $421 million and $387 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in 2022 over 2021 was primarily due to an increase in internally developed software assets at ICE Mortgage Technology.64Consolidated Non-Operating Income/(Expense) Income and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating. The following tables present our non-operating income/(expenses) (dollars in millions): Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,20222021Change20212020ChangeOther income/(expense):Interest income$108 $1 n/a$1 $10 (93)%Interest expense (616)(423)46 (423)(357)19 Other income/(expense), net (1,322)2,671 n/a2,671 80 n/aTotal other income/(expense), net $(1,830)$2,249 n/a$2,249 $(267)n/aNet income attributable to non-controlling interest $(52)$(11)383 %$(11)$(19)(44)%Interest IncomeInterest income increased in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to an increase in short-term interest rates combined with larger investment balances. Interest income in 2022 includes $76 million in interest income recognized in connection with the short-term investments related to the $5.0 billion of SMR Notes (as defined in ""Liquidity and Capital Resources— Debt"") for the Black Knight acquisition and the remainder primarily relates to interest on the restricted cash balances held within our regulated entities.Interest ExpenseInterest expense increased in 2022 from 2021 primarily due to $135 million in interest expense in 2022 related to the Black Knight acquisition-related-debt, $30 million in costs associated with our May 2022 debt refinancing as well as higher bond coupons associated with the re-financing of our existing debt. See “— Debt” below.Other income/(expense), netOur equity method investments include OCC and Bakkt, among others. We recognized ($1.3 billion) and ($42 million) during 2022 and 2021, respectively, of our share of estimated equity method investment losses, net, and impairment charges, which are included in other income/(expense). In 2022, after recording our share of Bakkt's equity method losses, which included Bakkt's impairment charge, we recorded an impairment charge on our investment in Bakkt to its fair value as other expense. This was based on what we consider to be an other-than-temporary decline in fair value as a result of several factors, including consideration of the impairment charge recorded by Bakkt (see Notes 3 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements). The estimated losses and impairment during 2022 and 2021 are primarily related to our investment in Bakkt. These are partially offset by the estimated profits related to our investment in OCC. Both 2022 and 2021 include adjustments to reflect the difference between reported prior period actual results from our original estimates.During 2021, Bakkt completed its merger with VIH, as a result of which we retained an approximate 68% economic interest in Bakkt, and we recorded a gain of $1.4 billion as other income upon our deconsolidation of Bakkt. Following the merger, we show our economic interest share of estimated Bakkt profits/(losses) as equity earnings, which are also included in other income (expense), net. We recorded other expense of ($92 million) related to our Bakkt investment for the post-merger period during 2021.During 2021, Coinbase completed an IPO and we sold our investment in Coinbase for $1.2 billion, and recorded a gain of $1.2 billion as other income.During 2022, we recorded a $9 million accrual for legal settlements as other expense. During 2021, we recorded a gain of $7 million related to the settlement of an acquisition-related indemnification claim from a prior acquisition as other income. In addition, we accrued approximately $16 million related to a legal settlement.We completed the sale of our Euroclear stake on May 20, 2022. The carrying value of our investment was $700 million at the time of the sale. We recorded a net gain of $41 million on the sale, which is included in other income during 2022. We did not receive a Euroclear dividend during the 2022 prior to the sale of our investment.65We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $9 million and $13 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively. This was primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income/(expense), net, when the settlement of foreign currency assets, liabilities and payables occur in non-functional currencies and there is an increase or decrease in the period-end foreign currency exchange rates between periods. See Item 7A “- Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk -Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for more information on these items.In connection with Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-07, Compensation Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost, or ASU 2017-07, we are recognizing the other components of net benefit cost of our defined benefit plans in the income statement as non-operating income on a full retrospective basis. The combined net periodic expense of these plans was $2 million and $3 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively.Non-controlling InterestFor consolidated subsidiaries in which our ownership is less than 100%, and for which we have control over the assets, liabilities and management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interests are shown as non-controlling interests. As of December 31, 2022, our non-controlling interests include those related to the non-ICE limited partners' interest in our CDS clearing subsidiaries and non-controlling interest in ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. During 2021 we received a contribution from a group of minority investors for a non-controlling interest in ICE Futures Abu Dhabi. Prior to completion of the Bakkt transaction on October 15, 2021, our non-controlling interest also included the redeemable non-controlling interest of the non-ICE partners in Bakkt. On October 15, 2021, Bakkt completed its merger with VIH and as of December 31, 2021, we no longer held redeemable non-controlling interest related to Bakkt. Refer to Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this Annual Report.Consolidated Income Tax Provision Consolidated income tax expense was $310 million and $1.6 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The change in consolidated income tax expense between years is primarily due to the tax impact of changes in our pre-tax income and the changes in our effective tax rate. The consolidated income tax expense for 2021 was elevated due to the tax expense associated with the gains resulting from our Coinbase and Bakkt transactions. Our effective tax rate was 17% and 29% in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2022 is lower than the effective tax rate for 2021 primarily due to the deferred income tax benefit from the impairment to our equity method investment in Bakkt in 2022 and deferred income tax expenses from the U.K. tax law changes in 2021. In 2021, the U.K. enacted a corporate income tax rate increase from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023.See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included in this Annual Report, for additional information on these tax items.66Liquidity and Capital Resources Below are charts that reflect our outstanding debt and capital allocation. The acquisition and integration costs in the chart below include cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash received for divestitures, cash paid for equity and equity method investments, cash paid for non-controlling interest and redeemable non-controlling interest, and acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, in each year.We have financed our operations, growth and cash needs primarily through income from operations and borrowings under our various debt facilities. Our principal capital requirements have been to fund capital expenditures, working capital, strategic acquisitions and investments, stock repurchases, dividends and the development of our technology platforms. We believe that our cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to repay our outstanding debt, but we 67may also need to incur additional debt or issue additional equity securities in the future. See “- Future Capital Requirements” below.See “- Cash Flow” below for a discussion of our capital expenditures and capitalized software development costs.Consolidated cash and cash equivalents were $1.8 billion and $607 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We had $6.6 billion and $1.4 billion in short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, the increase of which is related to the restricted $5.0 billion of SMR Notes intended to be used to finance the Black Knight acquisition. We had $142.0 billion and $145.9 billion of cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.As of December 31, 2022, the amount of unrestricted cash held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries was $502 million. Due to U.S. tax reform, the majority of our foreign earnings since January 1, 2018 have been subject to immediate U.S. income taxation, and the existing non-U.S. unrestricted cash balance can be distributed to the U.S. in the future with no material additional income tax consequences.Our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are managed as a global treasury portfolio of non-speculative financial instruments that are readily convertible into cash, such as overnight deposits, term deposits, money market funds, mutual funds for treasury investments, short duration fixed income investments and other money market instruments, thus ensuring high liquidity of financial assets. We may invest a portion of our cash in excess of short-term operating needs in investment-grade marketable debt securities, including government or government-sponsored agencies and corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2022, we held $1 million of unrestricted cash that was set aside for legal, regulatory and surveillance operations at NYSE.Cash Flow The following table presents the major components of net changes in cash and cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents (in millions):Year Ended December 31,202220212020Net cash provided by (used in):Operating activities$3,554 $3,123 $2,881 Investing activities677 (786)(10,361)Financing activities(1,841)62,026 26,000 Effect of exchange rate changes (23)(6)8 Net increase in cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, and cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds$2,367 $64,357 $18,528 Operating ActivitiesNet cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain items, including depreciation and amortization, deferred taxes, stock-based compensation and the effects of changes in working capital. The $431 million increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2022 from 2021 was driven by a $220 million increase in net income, adjusted for certain noncash operating activities. In 2022, these adjustments also include the gain on the sale of our Euroclear investment and the net losses and impairment of our unconsolidated investees. During 2021, these adjustments also included the gains on the sale of our Coinbase investment and our deconsolidation of Bakkt. Net income increased in 2022 from 2021 due to higher revenues of $146 million, driven by our Exchanges and Fixed Income and Data Services segments, as well as lower expenses, primarily due to the deconsolidation of Bakkt.The remaining $211 million increase is due to changes in our working capital and the timing of various payments and receipts. These changes include higher Section 31 fees payable of $316 million due to the rate changes determined by the SEC, offset primarily by timing of various payments and receipts, including higher interest receivable/payable on the cash and collateral held at our clearinghouses.Investing Activities Consolidated net cash provided by investing activities in 2022 primarily relates to $7.5 billion of proceeds from the sale of invested margin deposits and $741 million in proceeds from the sale of our Euroclear investment, partially offset by $6.9 billion purchases of invested margin deposits, $225 million of capitalized expenditures, $257 million of software development costs, $73 million for purchases of equity and equity method investments and $59 million cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired.68Consolidated net cash used in investing activities in 2021 relates to $5.1 billion purchases of invested margin deposits, $179 million of capitalized expenditures, $273 million of capitalized software development costs, $117 million for the purchase of an equity method investment and $66 million cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, partially offset by $3.7 billion of proceeds from the sale of invested margin deposits and $1.2 billion in proceeds from the sale of our Coinbase investment.The capital expenditures primarily relate to hardware and software purchases to continue the development and expansion of our electronic platforms, data services and clearing houses and leasehold improvements. The software development expenditures primarily relate to the development and expansion of our electronic trading platforms, data services, mortgage services and clearing houses.Financing Activities Consolidated net cash used in financing activities in 2022 primarily relates to a $4.5 billion change in our cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty fund balances, $2.7 billion in repayments of debt, $1.0 billion in net repayments under our Commercial Paper Program, $632 million in repurchases of common stock, $853 million in dividend payments to our stockholders and $73 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises, partially offset by $7.9 billion in net proceeds from our debt offerings. Consolidated net cash provided by financing activities in 2021 primarily relates to an increase in our cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty fund balances of $65.7 billion, partially offset by $1.2 billion in repayments of debt, $1.4 billion in net repayments under our Commercial Paper Program, $250 million in repurchases of common stock, $747 million in dividend payments to stockholders and $70 million in cash payments related to treasury shares received for restricted stock tax payments and stock options exercises.DebtAs of December 31, 2022, we had $18.1 billion in outstanding debt, all of which relates to our senior notes. We also have $4 million outstanding under credit lines at our ICE India subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2022, our senior notes of $18.1 billion had a weighted average maturity of 16 years and a weighted average cost of 3.6% per annum. We did not have any commercial paper notes outstanding as of December 31, 2022.As of December 31, 2021, we had $13.9 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of $12.9 billion of senior notes, $1.0 billion under our U.S. dollar commercial paper program, or the Commercial Paper Program, and $10 million under credit lines at our ICE India subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, our senior notes of $12.9 billion had a weighted average maturity of 15 years and a weighted average cost of 2.9% per annum. The commercial paper notes had original maturities ranging from three to 73 days as of December 31, 2021, with a weighted average interest rate of 0.33% per annum, and a weighted average remaining maturity of 26 days.In September 2021, we used the proceeds from commercial paper issuances and cash on hand to fund the redemption of $1.25 billion aggregate principal amount of senior floating rate notes due in June 2023, or the Floating Rate Notes. We delivered a notice of redemption of the Floating Rate Notes to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, under the indenture governing the Floating Rate Notes, which was delivered to the holders of the Floating Rate Notes on September 17, 2021, and they were subsequently redeemed on September 27, 2021. In connection with this redemption, we recorded $4 million in accelerated unamortized deferred loan costs, which are included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income for 2021.We have a $3.9 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facility, or the Credit Facility, pursuant to a credit agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as primary administrative agent, issuing lender and swing-line lender, Bank of America, N.A., as syndication agent, backup administrative agent and swing-line lender, and the lenders party thereto. On October 15, 2021, we agreed with the lenders to extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility to October 15, 2026, among other items. On May 25, 2022, we agreed with the lenders to extend the maturity date of the Credit Facility from October 15, 2026, to May 25, 2027, among other items. As of December 31, 2022, of the $3.9 billion that is currently available for borrowing under the Credit Facility, $171 million was required to support certain broker-dealer and other subsidiary commitments. We did not have any notes outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program, as of December 31, 2022. Therefore, there was not a required amount to backstop the Commercial Paper Program. Amounts required to backstop notes outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program will fluctuate as we increase or decrease our commercial paper borrowings. The remaining $3.7 billion is available for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, acting as a backstop to future increases in the amounts outstanding under the Commercial Paper Program.On May 23, 2022, we issued $8.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of new senior notes, comprised of the following:•$1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 3.65% senior notes due in 2025, or the 2025 Notes;69•$1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.00% senior notes due in 2027, or the 2027 Notes;•$1.25 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.35% senior notes due in 2029, or the 2029 Notes;•$1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.60% senior notes due in 2033, or the 2033 Notes;•$1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.95% senior notes due in 2052, or the 2052 Notes; and•$1.0 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.20% senior notes due in 2062, or the 2062 Notes, collectively, the Notes.We intend to use the net proceeds of $4.9 billion from the offering of the 2025 Notes, the 2027 Notes, the 2029 Notes and the 2062 Notes, or collectively, the SMR Notes, together with the issuance of commercial paper and/or borrowings under the Credit Facility, cash on hand or other immediately available funds and borrowings under the Term Loan, discussed below, to finance the cash portion of the purchase price for Black Knight. The SMR Notes are subject to a special mandatory redemption feature pursuant to which we will be required to redeem all of the outstanding SMR Notes at a redemption price equal to 101% of the aggregate principal amount of the SMR Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, in the event that the Black Knight acquisition is not consummated on or prior to May 4, 2023 subject to two automatic extensions of three months each, to August 4, 2023 and to November 4, 2023, respectively, if clearance under the HSR Act (or a restraint under U.S. antitrust laws) remains outstanding and all other conditions to closing are satisfied (or in the case of conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, are capable of being satisfied if the closing were to occur on such date) at each extension date, or if the Black Knight merger agreement is terminated at any time prior to such date. ICE would then need to secure new financing to close the transaction. There can be no assurance that the new financing could be secured and if it is secured, the terms of the new financing may be more expensive to ICE when compared to the existing financing terms for the $5.0 billion of outstanding notes. The $4.9 billion of net proceeds from the SMR Notes are separately invested and recorded as short-term restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.We used the $3.0 billion of net proceeds from the offering of the 2033 Notes and the 2052 Notes to redeem $2.7 billion aggregate principal amount of four series of senior notes that would have matured in 2022 and 2023. The balance of the net proceeds was used for general corporate purposes, which included paying down a portion of the amounts outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program. We recorded $30 million in costs associated with the extinguishment and re-financing of our existing debt in connection with our May 2022 debt refinancing. These costs are included in interest expense in our consolidated statements of income for 2022. For additional information regarding this transaction, refer to Note 3 to our consolidated unaudited financial statements, included in this Annual Report.On May 4, 2022, we entered into a 364-day senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount not to exceed $14.0 billion, or the Bridge Facility. The commitments that the Company obtained for the Bridge Facility were permanently reduced from $14.0 billion and there were no amounts outstanding as of December 31, 2022 as a result of (i) the amendment and extension of the Credit Facility, (ii) the issuance by the Company of certain senior unsecured notes on May 23, 2022, (iii) Euroclear divestment proceeds, (iv) the generation of cash internally by the Company, and (v) the effectiveness of our term loan facility.On May 25, 2022, we entered into a $2.4 billion two-year senior unsecured delayed draw term loan facility, or the Term Loan. Draws under the Term Loan bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at either (a) Term SOFR plus an applicable margin plus a credit spread adjustment of 10 basis points or (b) a ""base rate"" plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin ranges from 0.625% to 1.125% for Term SOFR loans and from 0.000% to 0.125% for base rate loans, in each case, based on a ratings-based pricing grid. The proceeds from borrowings under the Term Loan will be used to fund a portion of the purchase price for the Black Knight acquisition. We have the option to prepay outstanding amounts under the Term Loan in whole or in part at any time. No amounts were outstanding under the Term Loan as of December 31, 2022.Our Commercial Paper Program enables us to borrow efficiently at reasonable short-term interest rates and provides us with the flexibility to de-lever using our strong annual cash flows from operating activities whenever our leverage becomes elevated as a result of investment or acquisition activities. We had net repayments of $1.0 billion under our Commercial Paper Program during 2022, and did not have any notes outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program as of December 31, 2022.Upon maturity of our commercial paper and to the extent old issuances are not repaid by cash on hand, we are exposed to the rollover risk of not being able to issue new commercial paper. To mitigate this risk, we maintain the Credit Facility for an aggregate amount which meets or exceeds the amount issued under our Commercial Paper Program at any time. If we were not able to issue new commercial paper, we have the option of drawing on the backstop revolving facility. However, electing to do so would result in higher interest expense.70For additional details of our debt instruments, refer to Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.Capital ReturnIn December 2021, our Board approved an aggregate of $3.15 billion for future repurchases of our common stock with no fixed expiration date that became effective January 1, 2022. The $3.15 billion replaced the previous amount approved by the Board. The approval of our Board for stock repurchases does not obligate us to acquire any particular amount of our common stock. In addition, our Board may increase or decrease the amount available for repurchases from time to time.During 2022, we repurchased 5.0 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $632 million, including 4.6 million shares at a cost of $582 million under our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan and 0.4 million shares at a cost of $50 million on the open market. During 2021, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of our outstanding common stock at a cost of $250 million on the open market. Open market repurchases are only made during an open trading period and all shares repurchased are held in treasury stock.We discontinued stock repurchases and terminated our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan in August 2020 in connection with our Ellie Mae acquisition and in November 2021, we resumed repurchases. In December 2021, we entered into a new Rule 10b5-1 trading plan that became effective in February 2022. In connection with our pending acquisition of Black Knight, on May 4, 2022, we terminated our Rule 10b5-1 trading plan and suspended share repurchases. The remaining balance of Board approved funds for future repurchases as of December 31, 2022 was $2.5 billion.From time to time, we enter into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, as authorized by our Board, to govern some or all of the repurchases of our shares of common stock. We may discontinue stock repurchases at any time and may amend or terminate a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan at any time, subject to applicable rules. We expect funding for any stock repurchases to come from our operating cash flow or borrowings under our Commercial Paper Program or our debt facilities. The timing and extent of future repurchases that are not made pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 trading plan will be at our discretion and will depend upon many conditions. In making a determination regarding any stock repurchases, management considers multiple factors, including overall stock market conditions, our common stock price performance, the remaining amount authorized for repurchases by our Board, the potential impact of a stock repurchase program on our corporate debt ratings, our expected free cash flow and working capital needs, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives, and other potential uses of our cash and capital resources.During 2022, we paid cash dividends of $1.52 per share of our common stock in the aggregate, including quarterly dividends of $0.38 per share, for an aggregate payout of $853 million, which includes the payment of dividend equivalents on unvested employee restricted stock units. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report, for details on the amounts of our quarterly dividend payouts for the last three years. Future Capital Requirements Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including the rate of growth across our segments, strategic plans and acquisitions, available sources for financing activities, required and discretionary technology and clearing initiatives, regulatory requirements, the timing and introduction of new products and enhancements to existing products, the geographic mix of our business and potential stock repurchases. We currently expect to incur capital expenditures (including operational and real estate capital expenditures) and to incur software development costs that are eligible for capitalization ranging in the aggregate between $450 million and $500 million in 2023, which we believe will support the enhancement of our technology, business integration and the continued growth of our businesses.As of December 31, 2022, we had $2.5 billion authorized for future repurchases of our common stock. Refer to Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional details on our stock repurchase program.Our Board has adopted a quarterly dividend policy providing that dividends will be approved quarterly by the Board or the Audit Committee taking into account factors such as our evolving business model, prevailing business conditions, our current and future planned strategic growth initiatives and our financial results and capital requirements, without a predetermined net income payout ratio. On February 2, 2023, we announced a $0.42 per share dividend for the first quarter of 2023 payable on March 31, 2023 to stockholders of record as of March 17, 2023.Other than the facilities for the ICE Clearing Houses, our Credit Facility and our Commercial Paper Program are currently the only significant agreements or arrangements that we have for liquidity and capital resources with third parties. See 71Notes 10 and 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. In the event of any strategic acquisitions, mergers or investments, or if we are required to raise capital for any reason or desire to return capital to our stockholders, we may incur additional debt, issue additional equity to raise necessary funds, repurchase additional shares of our common stock or pay a dividend. However, we cannot provide assurance that such financing or transactions will be available or successful, or that the terms of such financing or transactions will be favorable to us. See “-Risk Factors"" and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements, included in this Annual Report.Non-GAAP Measures We use certain financial measures internally to evaluate our performance and make financial and operational decisions that are presented in a manner that adjusts from their equivalent GAAP measures or that supplement the information provided by our GAAP measures. We use these adjusted results because we believe they more clearly highlight trends in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our core operating performance. We use these measures in communicating certain aspects of our results and performance, including in this Annual Report, and believe that these measures, when viewed in conjunction with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, can provide investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting our financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for making period-to-period comparisons of results because the adjustments to GAAP are not reflective of our core business performance. These financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. We encourage investors to review the GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report, including our consolidated financial statements, to aid in their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons.The table below outlines our adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are non-GAAP measures that are calculated by making adjustments for items we view as not reflective of our cash operations and core business performance. These measures, including the adjustments and their related income tax effect and other tax adjustments (in millions, except for percentages and per share amounts), are as follows:72Exchanges SegmentFixed Income and Data Services SegmentMortgage Technology SegmentConsolidatedYear Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,Year Ended December 31,Operating income adjustments:202220212020202220212020202220212020202220212020Total revenues, less transaction-based expenses$4,071 $3,856 $3,631 $2,092 $1,883 $1,810 $1,129 $1,407 $595 $7,292 $7,146 $6,036 Operating expenses1,209 1,333 1,242 1,373 1,354 1,318 1,072 1,010 443 3,654 3,697 3,003 Less: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles67 73 74 180 180 191 363 369 123 610 622 388 Less: Transaction and integration costs and acquisition-related success fees — 59 12 — — — 91 39 89 91 98 101 Less: Impairment of developed software— — 11 — — — — — — — — 11 Less: Accrual relating to a regulatory settlement— — — — — 8 — — — — — 8 Adjusted operating expenses$1,142 $1,201 $1,145 $1,193 $1,174 $1,119 $618 $602 $231 $2,953 $2,977 $2,495 Operating income$2,862 $2,523 $2,389 $719 $529 $492 $57 $397 $152 $3,638 $3,449 $3,033 Adjusted operating income$2,929 $2,655 $2,486 $899 $709 $691 $511 $805 $364 $4,339 $4,169 $3,541 Operating margin70 %65 %66 %34 %28 %27 %5 %28 %25 %50 %48 %50 %Adjusted operating margin72 %69 %68 %43 %38 %38 %45 %57 %61 %59 %58 %59 %Non-operating income adjustments:Net income attributable to ICE common stockholders$1,446 $4,058 $2,089 Add: Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles610 622 388 Add: Transaction and integration costs and acquisition-related success fees 91 98 101 Less: Gain on sale and fair value adjustment of equity investments and dividends received, net(41)(1,321)(55)Less: Gain on deconsolidation of Bakkt— (1,419)— Add/(Less): Net losses/(income) from and impairment of unconsolidated investees1,340 42 (71)Add: Net interest expense on pre-acquisition-related debt and debt extinguishment89 4 19 Add: Other9 9 51 Add/(Less): Net income tax effect for the above items and deferred tax adjustments (579)587 (109)Add: Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles9 183 36 Adjusted net income attributable to ICE common stockholders$2,974 $2,863 $2,449 Diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$2.58 $7.18 $3.77 Adjusted diluted earnings per share attributable to ICE common stockholders$5.30 $5.06 $4.41 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding561 565 555 Amortization of acquisition-related intangibles are included in non-GAAP adjustments as excluding these non-cash expenses provides greater clarity regarding our financial strength and stability of cash operating results. Transaction and integration costs are included as part of our core business expenses, except for those that are directly related to the announcement, closing, financing or termination of a transaction. However, we adjust for the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs relating to acquisitions such as Ellie Mae given the magnitude of the $11.4 billion purchase price of the acquisition. We also adjust for the acquisition-related transaction costs related to the merger of Bakkt and VIH, and for our pending acquisition of Black Knight, due to the significance of these transactions.We adjust for gains and losses on investment transactions and changes in the fair value of our investments. Our investments are not considered to be a part of our core business operations and the impacts of changes in our investments are often non-cash in nature. The following non-GAAP adjustments are reported in the table above related to investments:•During 2022, we excluded the $41 million gain on the sale of our Euroclear investment; •During 2021 and 2020, we excluded $34 million and $35 million, respectively, of fair value gains on our Euroclear equity investment and during 2021, we excluded Euroclear dividends received of $60 million;•In 2021, we excluded the $1.4 billion gain on the deconsolidation of Bakkt and the $1.2 billion gain on the sale of our Coinbase equity investment; and•In 2020, we excluded the $20 million gain on the sale of our BIDS equity investment.73Similarly, and as included in the table above, we adjust for our share of net income/(losses) and impairment charges related to our equity method investments, which primarily include OCC and Bakkt. Our share of 2021 net losses from unconsolidated investees includes the period from the Bakkt merger on October 15, 2021 through December 31, 2021. During 2022, after recording our share of Bakkt's equity method losses, which included Bakkt's impairment charge, we recorded an impairment in our investment in Bakkt to its fair value as other expense. In 2022, the total Bakkt net losses and impairment was $1.4 billion and our share of OCC net income was $15 million. In 2021, our share of Bakkt losses was $92 million and our share of OCC income was $51 million. We believe these adjustments provide greater clarity of our performance given that equity method investments are non-cash and not a part of our core operations.We adjust for certain items related to our debt. Certain debt activities, such as the early termination of notes, pre-acquisition interest and expense and accelerated amortization of debt costs are not considered to be a part of our core business operations and the impacts of changes in our investments are often non-cash in nature. The following non-GAAP adjustments are reported in the table above related to our debt:•In 2022, we adjusted for costs of $30 million associated with the May and June 2022 extinguishment of four series of senior notes that would have matured in 2022 and 2023 using proceeds from our May 2022 issuance of new senior notes. •In 2022, we excluded $135 million of interest expense on pre-acquisition-related debt from our May 2022 debt refinancing related to the pending Black Knight acquisition. This adjustment was net of $76 million of interest income earnings on investments from the pre-acquisition debt proceeds.•In 2021, we adjusted for the acceleration of unamortized costs of $4 million related to the September 2021 early redemption of our Floating Rate Notes.•In 2020, we adjusted for the extinguishment payment of $14 million related to the June 2020 early redemption of the December 2020 Senior Notes which included both a make-whole redemption payment and duplicative interest, and adjusted for pre-acquisition interest expense of $5 million on the August 2020 debt issued to fund a portion of the purchase price of our Ellie Mae acquisition.Other adjustments not considered to be a part of our core business operations include:•Accruals related to legal and regulatory settlements, including settlements related to an acquisition-related indemnification claim;•A 2020 impairment of software developed at Bakkt when it was our subsidiary, since it related to the build-out of a fundamental software design rather than a recurring upgrade; and•A 2020 promissory note impairment charge on work performed by the original plan processor on the CAT as non-GAAP adjustments. See additional discussion on the CAT in Item 1(A) ""-Risk Factors"" in this Annual Report.Non-GAAP tax adjustments include the tax impacts of the pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments and deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles. Deferred tax adjustments on acquisition-related intangibles include the impact of U.K. and U.S. state tax law changes and apportionment updates, as well as other foreign tax law changes which resulted in deferred tax expense of $9 million, $183 million and $36 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to the following:•Deferred tax adjustments in 2022 related primarily to U.S. state apportionment changes. •Deferred tax adjustments in 2021 related primarily to the U.K. tax law changes enacted in June 2021, which increased the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% effective April 1, 2023. •The deferred tax adjustments in 2020 were due to the tax law changes enacted in July 2020, which increased the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% effective April 1, 2020, as well as impacts of U.S. state apportionment charges.For additional information on these items, refer to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report and “- Recent Developments,” “- Consolidated Operating Expenses”, “- Consolidated Non-Operating Income (Expenses)” and “-Consolidated Income Tax Provision” above.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As described in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, certain clearing house collateral is reported off-balance sheet. We do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities.74Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments We intend to fund our contractual obligations and commercial commitments from existing cash and cash flow from operations. As of December 31, 2022, our primary cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.As of December 31, 2022, we had $18.1 billion in outstanding debt, including $4 million of short-term debt. Our outstanding debt consists of $18.1 billion of fixed rate senior notes and $4 million under credit lines at our ICE India subsidiaries.Our operating leases primarily relate to our leased office space and data center facilities, and as of December 31, 2022, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $342 million, with $73 million payable within one-year.We have other purchase obligations to purchase various goods and services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding.In addition, we have $147.4 billion in cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin. Clearing members of our clearing houses are required to deposit original margin and variation margin and to make deposits to a guaranty fund. The cash and cash equivalent deposits made to these margin accounts and to the guaranty fund are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as current assets with corresponding current liabilities to the clearing members that deposited them. ICE NGX administers the physical delivery of energy trading contracts. It has an equal and offsetting claim to and from its respective participants on opposite sides of the physically-settled contract, each of which is reflected as a delivery contract receivable with an offsetting delivery contract payable. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information on our clearing houses and the margin deposits, guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts payable and unsettled variation margin.We also have unrecognized tax benefits, or UTBs. As of December 31, 2022, our cumulative UTBs were $247 million, and accrued interest and penalties related to UTBs were $61 million. We are under examination by various tax authorities. We are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the periods of cash settlement because it is not possible to reasonably predict the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, that might be assessed by a tax authority or the timing of an assessment or payment. It is also not possible to reasonably predict whether or not the applicable statutes of limitations might expire without us being examined by any particular tax authority. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our UTBs. As of December 31, 2022, we, through NYSE, have net obligations of $102 million related to our pension and other benefit programs. The date of payment under these net obligations cannot be determined. See Note 17 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our pension and other benefit programs. In addition, the future funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT is ultimately expected to be provided by both the SROs and broker-dealers. To date, however, funding has been provided solely by the SROs, and future funding is expected to be repaid if industry member fees are approved by the SEC and subsequently collected by industry members.New and Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for information on the new and recently adopted accounting pronouncements that are applicable to us.Critical Accounting Policies We have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout “- Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 75We base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when we make these estimates and judgments and re-evaluate them on a periodic basis. Based on these factors, we make estimates and judgments about, among other things, the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from market prices or other independent sources and about the recognition and characterization of our revenues and expenses. The values and results based on these estimates and judgments could differ significantly under different assumptions or conditions and could change materially in the future. We believe that the following critical accounting policies, among others, affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and could materially increase or decrease our reported results, assets and liabilities. Goodwill and Other Identifiable Intangible Assets Assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an acquired company over the fair value of its identifiable net assets, including identified intangible assets. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, trademarks, technology, trading products, data, exchange registrations, backlog, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. Our determination of the fair value of the intangible assets and whether or not these assets may be impaired following their acquisition requires us to apply significant judgments and make significant estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows. If we change our strategy or if market conditions shift, our judgments and estimates may change, which may result in adjustments to recorded asset balances. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives whereas goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not. In performing the allocation of the acquisitions' purchase price to assets and liabilities, we consider, among other factors, the intended use of the acquired assets, analysis of past financial performance and estimates of future performance of the acquired business. At the acquisition date, a preliminary allocation of the purchase price is recorded based upon a preliminary valuation performed with the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist. We continue to review and assess our estimates, assumptions and valuation methodologies during the measurement period provided by GAAP, which ends as soon as we receive the information about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date or we learn that more information is not obtainable, which usually does not exceed one year from the date of acquisition. Accordingly, these estimates and assumptions are subject to change, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Estimation uncertainty may exist due to the sensitivity of the respective fair value to underlying assumptions about the future performance of an acquired business in our discounted cash flow models. Significant assumptions typically include revenue growth rates and expense synergies that form the basis of the forecasted results and the discount rate.Our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually in our fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the value may be impaired. We test our goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, and we have identified four reporting units. Our reporting units identified for our goodwill testing are the NYSE, Other Exchanges, Fixed Income and Data Services, and Mortgage Technology reporting units. These impairment evaluations are performed by comparing the carrying value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangibles to its estimated fair value. In accordance with ASU 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, or ASU-2017, for both goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment testing, we have the option to first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. If the fair value of the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recognized in earnings in an amount equal to the difference. Alternatively, we may choose to bypass the qualitative option and perform quantitative testing to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value. For our goodwill impairment testing, we have elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and apply the quantitative approach. For our testing of indefinite-lived intangible assets, we apply qualitative and quantitative approaches.Application of the impairment test requires judgment, including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, assignment of goodwill to reporting units, and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit. We have historically determined the fair value of our reporting units based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis and a multiple of earnings approach. In assessing whether goodwill and other intangible assets are impaired, we must make estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows, long-term growth rates of our business, operating margins, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and other factors to determine the fair value of our assets. These estimates and assumptions require management’s judgment, and changes to these estimates and assumptions, as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions, could materially affect the 76determination of fair value and/or impairment. We did not record any impairments in 2022, 2021 or 2020 as a result of our goodwill or indefinite-lived impairment testing.We are also required to evaluate other finite-lived intangible assets for impairment by first determining whether events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets to be held and used may not be recoverable. If impairment indicators are present, then an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by these long-lived assets is compared to the carrying value of those assets to determine if the asset is recoverable. If an asset is not recoverable, the loss is measured as the difference between fair value and carrying value of the impaired asset. Fair value of these assets is based on various valuation techniques, including discounted cash flow analysis, which are assessed and conducted in accordance with our internal impairment analysis policies.Income Taxes We are subject to income taxes in the U.S., U.K. and other foreign jurisdictions where we operate. The determination of our provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities requires the use of significant judgment, estimates, and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws. We recognize a current tax liability or tax asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable on tax returns for the current year. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities. We establish valuation allowances if we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences and carryforwards are expected to reverse.The Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Staff has provided additional guidance to address the accounting for the effects of the provisions related to the taxation of Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income noting that companies should make an accounting policy election to recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse in future years or to include the tax expense in the year it is incurred. We have made a policy election to recognize such taxes as current period expenses when incurred.We do not recognize a tax benefit unless we conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on audit by the taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position. If the recognition threshold is met, we recognize a tax benefit measured at the largest amount of the tax benefit that, in our judgment, is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized. We recognize accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain income tax positions as income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income.We operate within multiple domestic and foreign taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits, and the accruals may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. At any point in time, many tax years are subject to or in the process of being audited by various taxing authorities. To the extent our estimates of settlements change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. Our income tax expense includes changes in our estimated liability for exposures associated with our various tax filing positions. Determining the income tax expense for these potential assessments requires management to make assumptions that are subject to factors such as proposed assessments by tax authorities, changes in facts and circumstances, issuance of new regulations, and resolution of tax audits. We believe the judgments and estimates discussed above are reasonable. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. ITEM 7 (A). QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK As a result of our operating and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and credit risk. We have implemented policies and procedures designed to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are regularly reviewed by the appropriate management and supervisory bodies. 77Interest Rate Risk We have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term investments and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents were $8.4 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, of which $346 million and $276 million, respectively, were denominated in pounds sterling, euros or Canadian dollars, and the remaining amounts are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. A hypothetical 50% decrease in short-term interest rates would decrease our annual pre-tax earnings by $21 million as of December 31, 2022, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term and long-term restricted cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022, we had $18.1 billion in outstanding debt, consisting of $18.1 billion related to our senior notes and $4 million under lines of credit at our India subsidiaries. See Part II, Item 7, ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Debt,"" and Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. The interest rates on our Commercial Paper Program are currently evaluated based upon current maturities and market conditions. As of December 31, 2022, we did not have any notes outstanding under our Commercial Paper Program. The weighted average interest rate on our Commercial Paper Program was 0.33% as of December 31, 2021. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances will continue to fluctuate based on the movement in short-term interest rates along with shifts in supply and demand within the commercial paper market.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk As an international business, we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We may experience gains or losses from foreign currency transactions in the future given that a significant part of our assets and liabilities are recorded in pounds sterling, Canadian dollars or euros, and a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are recorded in pounds sterling or euros. Certain assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of foreign subsidiaries are denominated in the local functional currency of such subsidiaries. Our exposure to foreign denominated earnings in 2022 and 2021 is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (dollars in millions, except exchange rates): Year Ended December 31, 2022Year Ended December 31, 2021 Pound Sterling EuroPound Sterling EuroAverage exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the current year$1.2376 $1.0540 $1.3762 $1.1835 Average exchange rate to the U.S. dollar in the prior year$1.3762 $1.1835 $1.2832 $1.1412 Average exchange rate increase/(decrease)(10)%(11)%7 %4 %Foreign denominated percentage of: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses7 %6 %7 %6 %Operating expenses7 %2 %8 %2 %Operating income7 %11 %6 %11 %Impact of the currency fluctuations (1) on: Revenues, less transaction-based expenses$(59)$(56)$31 $13 Operating expenses$(30)$(8)$19 $3 Operating income$(29) $(48)$12 $10 (1) Represents the impact of currency fluctuation for the year compared to the same period in the prior year.We have a significant part of our assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses recorded in pounds sterling or euros. In both 2022 and 2021, 13% of our consolidated revenues, less transaction-based expenses, were denominated in pounds sterling or euros, and in 2022 and 2021, 9% and 10%, respectively, of our consolidated operating expenses were denominated in pounds sterling or euros. As the pound sterling or euro exchange rate changes, the U.S. equivalent of revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies changes accordingly.Foreign currency transaction risk related to the settlement of foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables occurs through our operations, which are received in or paid in pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, or euros, due to the increase or decrease in the foreign currency exchange rates between periods. We incurred foreign currency transaction losses of $9 million and $13 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, inclusive of the impact of foreign currency hedging transactions. The foreign currency transaction losses were primarily attributable to the fluctuations of the pound sterling 78and euro relative to the U.S. dollar. A 10% adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates as of December 31, 2022, assuming no change in the composition of the foreign currency denominated assets, liabilities and payables and assuming no hedging activity, would result in a foreign currency loss of $14 million.We entered into foreign currency hedging transactions during 2022 and 2021 as economic hedges to help mitigate a portion of our foreign exchange risk exposure and may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future to help mitigate our foreign exchange risk exposure. Although we may enter into additional hedging transactions in the future, these hedging arrangements may not be effective, particularly in the event of imprecise forecasts of the levels of our non-U.S. denominated assets and liabilities. We have foreign currency translation risk equal to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using a current rate of exchange, with gains or losses included in the cumulative translation adjustment account, a component of equity. Our exposure to the net investment in foreign currencies is presented by primary foreign currencies in the table below (in millions): As of December 31, 2022 Position in pounds sterlingPosition in Canadian dollarsPosition in eurosAssets£720 $4,298 €171 of which goodwill represents561 394 92 Liabilities101 3,852 52 Net currency position£619 $446 €119 Net currency position, in $USD$748 $329 $127 Negative impact on consolidated equity of a 10% decrease in foreign currency exchange rates$75 $33 $13 Foreign currency translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) within our balance sheet. See the table below for the portion of equity attributable to foreign currency translation adjustments as well as the activity by year included within our statement of other comprehensive income. The impact of the foreign currency exchange rate differences in the table below were primarily driven by fluctuations of the pound sterling as compared to the U.S. dollar which were 1.2093, 1.3524 and 1.3665 as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/ (Loss) from Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments (in millions)Balance, as of January 1, 2020$(177)Net current period other comprehensive income/(loss)43 Balance, as of December 31, 2020(134)Net current period other comprehensive income/(loss)(16)Balance, as of December 31, 2021(150)Net current period other comprehensive income/(loss)(128)Balance, as of December 31, 2022$(278) The future impact on our business relating to the U.K. leaving the EU and the corresponding regulatory changes are uncertain at this time, including future impacts on currency exchange rates.Credit Risk We are exposed to credit risk in our operations in the event of a counterparty default. We limit our exposure to credit risk by rigorously selecting the counterparties with which we make our investments, monitoring them on an ongoing basis and executing agreements to protect our interests. Clearing House Cash Deposit RisksThe ICE Clearing Houses hold material amounts of clearing member margin deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. Refer to Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for more information on the ICE Clearing Houses' cash and cash equivalent margin deposits and 79guaranty funds, invested deposits, delivery contracts receivable and unsettled variation margin which were $147.4 billion as of December 31, 2022. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return which may generate interest income for our clearing members, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the ICE Clearing Houses may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the clearing members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated:•Credit Risk: When a clearing house has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearing house utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. Credit risk is managed by using exposure limits depending on the credit profile of the counterparty as well as the nature and maturity of transactions. Our investment objective is to invest in securities that preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. We seek to substantially mitigate the credit risk associated with investments by placing them with governments, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.An ongoing review is performed to evaluate changes in the financial status of counterparties. In addition to the intrinsic creditworthiness of counterparties, our policies require diversification of counterparties (banks, financial institutions, bond issuers and funds) so as to avoid a concentration of risk.•Liquidity Risk: Liquidity risk is the risk a clearing house may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and at the right time. To mitigate this risk, the clearing houses monitor liquidity requirements closely and maintain funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearing house to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short term investments such as overnight reverse repurchase agreements serves to reduce liquidity risks.•Interest Rate Risk: Interest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise and cause the value of securities we hold or invest in to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale might be made at a loss relative to the carrying value. Our clearing houses seek to manage this risk by making short term investments. For example, where possible and in accordance with regulatory requirements, the clearing houses invest cash pursuant to overnight reverse repurchase agreements or term reverse repurchase agreements with short dated maturities. In addition, the clearing house investment guidelines allow for direct purchases of high quality sovereign debt (for example, U.S. Treasury securities) and supranational debt instruments (Euro cash deposits only) with short dated maturities. •Security Issuer Risk: Security issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on the payment when the security matures or debt is serviced. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments under the reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign or government agency debt and limiting any direct investments to high quality sovereign debt instruments. •Investment Counterparty Risk: Investment counterparty risk is the risk that a reverse repurchase agreement counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to our clearing houses. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral to securities of high quality issuers. When engaging in reverse repurchase agreements, our clearing houses take delivery of the securities underlying the reverse repurchase arrangement in custody accounts under clearing house control. Additionally, the securities purchased subject to reverse repurchase have a market value greater than the reverse repurchase amount. Thus, in the event that a reverse repurchase counterparty defaults on its obligation to repurchase the underlying reverse repurchase securities, our clearing house will have possession of a security with a value potentially greater than the counterparty’s obligation.The ICE Clearing Houses may use third-party investment advisors who make investments subject to the guidelines provided by each clearing house. Clearing house property is held in custody accounts under clearing house control with credit worthy custodians. The ICE Clearing Houses employ (or may employ) multiple investment advisors and custodians to ensure that in the event a single advisor or custodian is unable to fulfill its role, additional advisors or custodians are available as alternatives.•Cross-Currency Margin Deposit Risk: Each of the ICE Clearing Houses may permit posting of cross-currency collateral to satisfy margin requirements (for example, accepting margin deposits denominated in U.S. dollars to secure a Euro margin obligation). The ICE Clearing Houses mitigate the risk of a currency value exposure by applying a “haircut” to the currency posted as margin at a level viewed as sufficient to provide financial protection during periods of currency volatility. Cross-currency balances are marked-to-market on a daily basis. Should the currency posted to satisfy margin requirements decline in value, the clearing member is required to increase its margin deposit on a same-day basis.80Impact of InflationWe have not been materially adversely affected by inflation as technological advances and competition have generally caused prices for the hardware and software that we use for our electronic platforms to remain constant. In the event of continued inflation, we believe that we will be able to pass on any price increases to our participants, as the prices that we charge are not governed by long-term contracts.81",2023-12-30 20:40:16.766442
