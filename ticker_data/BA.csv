12927,BA,BOEING CO,2003,"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Information Is Subject to Risk and Uncertainty Certain statements in this report may constitute “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. As a result, these statements speak only as of the date they were made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our actual results and future trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including the continued operation, viability and growth of major airline customers and non-airline customers (such as the U.S. Government); adverse developments in the value of collateral securing customer and other financings; the occurrence of any significant collective bargaining labor dispute; the Company’s successful execution of internal performance plans, price escalation, production rate increases and decreases (including any reduction in or termination of an aircraft product), acquisition and divestiture plans, and other cost-reduction and productivity efforts; charges from any future SFAS No. 142 review; an adverse development in rating agency credit ratings or assessments; the actual outcomes of certain pending sales campaigns and U.S. and foreign government procurement activities, including the timing of procurement of tankers by the U.S. Department of Defense; the cyclical nature of some of the Company’s businesses; unanticipated financial market changes which may impact pension plan assumptions; domestic and international competition in the defense, space and commercial areas; continued integration of acquired businesses; performance issues with key suppliers, subcontractors and customers; factors that could result in significant and prolonged disruption to air travel worldwide (including future terrorist attacks); any additional impacts from the attacks of September 11, 2001; global trade policies; worldwide political stability; domestic and international economic conditions; price escalation; the outcome of political and legal processes, including uncertainty regarding government funding of certain programs; changing priorities or reductions in the U.S. Government or foreign government defense and space budgets; termination of government or commercial contracts due to unilateral government or customer action or failure to perform; legal, financial and governmental risks related to international transactions; legal proceedings; tax settlements with the IRS; and other economic, political and technological risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in the Company’s SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2001 and the Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2002, June 30, 2002 and September 30, 2002. - 11 - CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET IMPLEMENTED Application of Critical Accounting Policies The Company’s primary operating segments are Commercial Airplanes, Military Aircraft and Missile Systems, Space and Communications, and Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The following is a summary of the Company’s most critical accounting policies. Contract accounting Contract accounting is used predominately by the Military Aircraft and Missile Systems and Space and Communications segments. The majority of the business conducted in these segments is performed under contracts for the U.S. Government and foreign governments that extend over a number of years. The process to estimate the total contract cost-revenue relationship results in the development of gross margin and cost of sales percentages. These percentages are utilized in the recognition of earnings and are significant factors in contract accounting. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentages to the amount of revenue recognized for each contract. Total contract revenue estimates are based on the negotiated contract price modified by assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and contract terms that provide for the adjustment of prices in the event of variations from projected inflationary trends. Total contract cost estimates are based in a large part on historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections, and information provided by suppliers. Factors that influence these estimates include technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. Revenues under contracts with fixed prices are generally recognized as deliveries are made. For certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, revenues are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Revenues under contracts with terms that reimburse for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. The development of gross margin and cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas of the Company that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. This contract management process produces the Company’s best estimate of contract cost and contract revenue. Estimates of each significant contract’s cost and revenue are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. The experience over the past two years has resulted in a range of plus or minus 0.5% for the combined gross margin of all contracts in the Military Aircraft and Missile Systems and the Space and Communications segments. If combined gross margin for all contracts in the Military Aircraft and Missile Systems and the Space and Communications segments for all of 2002 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 0.5% it would have increased or decreased income for the year by approximately $125 million. - 12 - Program accounting The Company uses program accounting for its 7-series commercial airplane programs. Program accounting is a method of accounting for the costs of certain products manufactured for delivery under production type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling costs and warranty costs are accumulated and charged to revenue by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of revenue to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) their expected selling prices, production costs, program tooling, and warranty costs for the total program. The reliance on estimates in the use of program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the cost-revenue relationship for the defined program accounting quantity. The factors that must be estimated include selling price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured parts and major component costs, and overhead costs. To meet this requirement the Company employs a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimate are recognized on a prospective basis. Underlying all estimates used for program accounting is the assumed market and the corresponding production rates. The program accounting quantity is established based upon the assumed market. The total program revenue is determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity added together with the revenue for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates. Cost estimates are based in a large part on historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections, and information provided by suppliers. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. The Company recognizes revenue for commercial airplanes when a unit is completed and accepted by the customer. The revenue recognized is the price negotiated with the customer including special features adjusted by an escalation formula. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of revenue recognized for the quarter. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new airplane program (known as the learning curve effect), the actual costs incurred for production of the early units in the program will exceed the amount reported as cost of sales for those units. This difference known as deferred production costs is included in inventory along with unamortized tooling costs. The experience of the last two years, with all programs being relatively mature, has been that estimate changes due to model mix, escalation, cost performance, and accounting quantity increases have resulted in a range of plus or minus 0.5% for the combined gross margin of all commercial airplane programs. If combined gross margin for all commercial airplane programs for all of 2002 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 0.5% it would have increased or decreased income for the year by approximately $122 million. Aircraft valuation Used aircraft under trade-in agreements The Company enters into certain trade-in agreements to purchase used aircraft from customers at a specific price at a future point in time when those customers purchase new aircraft from the Company. In the event the Company accepts an aircraft under a trade-in agreement, the aircraft purchased by the Company serves as collateral to offset amounts paid by the Company to the customer. Obligations recorded from trade-in aircraft agreements are measured as the difference between gross amounts payable to customers and the estimated fair value of the collateral. The fair value of collateral is determined using a process based on the net present value of expected future cash flows from the trade-in aircraft, assuming the most likely market placement of the aircraft. The first step in this process uses the Company’s assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets to which the Company continually pursues opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, (1) the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage, (2) the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customer’s requirements, or (3) the scrap market. Collateral valuation varies significantly depending on which market the Company determines is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, the Company updates its valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. This quarterly collateral valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft. - 13 - Based on the best market information available at the time, the Company deemed it probable that it would be obligated to perform on trade-in agreements with gross amounts payable to customers totaling $1,370 million and $1,340 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Accounts payable and other liabilities included $156 million and $189 million as of December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, which represents the trade-in aircraft exposure related to these trade-in agreements. Using a measurement date of December 31, 2002, had the estimate of collateral value used to calculate its obligation related to trade-in agreements been 10% higher or lower than the Company’s actual assessment, accounts payable and other liabilities would have decreased or increased by approximately $121 million. The Company continually updates its assessment of the likelihood of its trade-in aircraft purchase obligations and continues to monitor all these obligations for adverse developments. Asset valuation for equipment under operating lease, held for re-lease and collateral on receivables The fair value of owned assets (equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease) and collateral on receivables is periodically assessed to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value. Differences between carrying value and fair value are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables and, in certain circumstances, recorded as impairment for owned assets. The Company uses the average published value from multiple sources based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, the Company applies judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft to determine fair value, usually when the features or utilization of the aircraft varies significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. Impairment review for equipment under operating leases and held for re-lease The Company reviews these assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable. An asset under operating lease or held for re-lease is considered impaired when the expected undiscounted cash flow over the remaining useful life is less than the book value. Various assumptions are used when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow. These assumptions include lease rates, lease term(s), periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the life of the asset. The determination of expected lease rates is generally based on outside publications. The Company uses historical information and current economic trends to determine the remaining assumptions. When impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment loss is the excess of carrying value over fair value. The Company estimates that had the fair value of such assets deemed impaired during 2002 been 10% higher or lower at the time each specific impairment had been taken, the impairment expense would have decreased or increased by approximately $6 million. The Company is unable to predict the magnitude of any future impairments. Allowance for losses on receivables The allowance for losses on receivables (valuation allowance) is a valuation account used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the balance sheet. The balance is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivable portfolio. The valuation allowance relates to two components of receivables: (a) specifically identified receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment, and (b) pools of receivables that are evaluated for impairment. A specific receivable is reviewed for impairment when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Company will be unable to collect amounts due according to the contractual terms of the receivable agreement. Factors considered in assessing uncollectibility include a customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filing for bankruptcy. A specific impairment allowance is provided based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral. The Company reviews the adequacy of the general valuation allowance attributable to the remaining pool of receivables by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value over the applicable collateral value of the related asset. A receivable with an estimated collateral value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted-average remaining portfolio term. Credit ratings are identified for each customer in the portfolio. Customer credit ratings are updated based on current rating agency information or the Company’s best estimates. - 14 - For each credit rating category, the collateral exposure is multiplied by an applicable historical default rate, yielding a credit-adjusted collateral exposure. Historical default rates are published by Standard & Poor’s reflecting both the customer credit rating and the weighted-average remaining portfolio term. The sum of the credit-adjusted collateral exposures generates an initial estimate of the general valuation allowance. In recognition of the uncertainty of the ultimate loss experience and relatively long duration of the portfolio, a range of reasonably possible outcomes of the portfolio’s credit-adjusted collateral exposure is calculated by varying the applicable default rate by approximately plus and minus 15%. The valuation allowance recorded represents the best estimate within the resulting range of credit-adjusted collateral exposure, factoring in considerations of risk of individual credits, current and projected economic and political conditions, and prior loss experience. The resulting range of the credit-adjusted collateral exposure as of December 31, 2002, was approximately $280 million to $355 million. The Company adjusted the valuation allowance to $342 million at December 31, 2002. Goodwill impairment The Company accounts for its goodwill under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This statement requires an impairment-only approach to accounting for goodwill. Because the composition of the Company has changed significantly due to various acquisitions, goodwill constitutes a significant portion of the Company’s long-term assets. As a result of the adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company recorded a pre-tax goodwill impairment charge of $2,410 million during the first quarter of 2002. The SFAS No. 142 goodwill impairment model is a two-step process. First, it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations used in the first step, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. SFAS No. 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually at the same time every year, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. The Company selected April 1 as its annual testing date. The Company estimates the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. The forecasts of future cash flows are based on the Company’s best estimate of future revenues and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions, and are subject to review and approval by senior management and the Board of Directors. Changes in these forecasts could cause a particular operating group to either pass or fail the first step in the SFAS No. 142 goodwill impairment model, which could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from the Company’s market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price will also affect the amount of impairment recorded. At the date of the previous impairment, a 10% increase in the value of Boeing common stock would have reduced the impairment charge recorded in the first quarter of 2002 by approximately $190 million. A 10% decrease in the value of Boeing common stock would have increased the impairment charge by approximately $160 million. Postretirement plans The Company sponsors various pension plans covering substantially all employees. The Company also provides postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage, to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. The liabilities and annual income or expense of the Company’s pension and other postretirement plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). Not all net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and a portion remains in inventory at the end of a reporting period. The Company uses a discount rate that is based on a point-in-time estimate as of the September 30 measurement date. This rate is determined based on a review of long-term, high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date and use of models that match projected benefit payments of the Company’s major United States pension and other postretirement plans to coupons and maturities from high quality bonds. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the 2002 pension and other postretirement liabilities by approximately $1,000 million (3%) and $230 million (3%), respectively, and decrease the 2002 net periodic pension and other postretirement expense by approximately $16 million and $11 million, respectively. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the 2002 pension and other postretirement liabilities by approximately $1,250 million (3.5%) and $250 million (3.5%), respectively, and increase the 2002 net periodic pension and other postretirement expense by approximately $18 million and $13 million, respectively. - 15 - Net periodic pension costs include an underlying expected long-term rate of asset return. In developing this assumption, the Company looks at a number of factors: a review of asset class return by several of the Company’s trust fund investment advisors, long-term inflation assumptions, and long-term historical returns for the Company’s plans. The expected long-term rate of asset return is based on a diversified portfolio including domestic and international equities, fixed income, real estate, private equities and uncorrelated assets. Pension income or expense is especially sensitive to changes in the long-term rate of asset return. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2002 pension income by approximately $95 million. The 2002 postretirement benefit obligation for non-pension plans reflects a significant increase in medical trend. Recent losses due to higher-than-expected increases in medical claims costs have created an unrecognized loss in 2002. The Company increased its short-term medical trend for 2003 to reflect the revised expectations of continued cost increases in the next few years. Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, which is effective January 1, 2003. This standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and the associated retirement costs. The Company has determined that the implementation of this standard will not have a material effect on its financial statements. In July 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This standard requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when they are incurred. The requirements of SFAS No. 146 apply prospectively to activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, and as such, the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impact of adopting these new rules until and unless it undertakes relevant activities in future periods. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45 (FIN 45), Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of the Indebtedness of Others, which clarifies the requirements of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies, relating to a guarantor’s accounting for and disclosures of certain guarantees issued. FIN 45 requires enhanced disclosures for certain guarantees. It also will require certain guarantees that are issued or modified after December 31, 2002, including certain third-party guarantees, to be initially recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. For guarantees issued on or before December 31, 2002, liabilities are recorded when and if payments become probable and estimable. The Company expects FIN 45 to have the general effect of delaying recognition for a portion of the revenue for product sales that are accompanied by certain third-party guarantees. The financial statement recognition provisions are effective prospectively, and the Company cannot reasonably estimate the impact of adopting FIN 45 until guarantees are issued or modified in future periods, at which time their results will be initially reported in the financial statements. See Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements discussion. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which clarifies the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, relating to consolidation of certain entities. First, FIN 46 will require identification of the Company’s participation in variable interests entities (VIE), which are defined as entities with a level of invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit them to operate on a stand alone basis, or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. For entities identified as VIE, FIN 46 sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to the VIE, if any, bears a majority of the exposure to its expected losses, or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns. FIN 46 also sets forth certain disclosures regarding interests in VIE that are deemed significant, even if consolidation is not required. The Company is currently assessing the application of FIN 46 as it relates to its variable interests. See Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements discussion. - 16 - CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION The Company operates in four principal segments: Commercial Airplanes, Military Aircraft and Missile Systems, Space and Communications, and BCC. All other activities fall within the Other segment, principally made up of Boeing Technology, Connexion by BoeingSM and Air Traffic Management. Consolidated Results of Operations (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $54,069 $58,198 $51,321 Operating Earnings $3,868 $3,896 $3,058 Operating Margins 7.2% 6.7% 6.0% Net Earnings $492 $2,827 $2,128 Research and Development* $1,639 $1,936 $1,998 Effective Income Tax Rate 27.1% 20.7% 29.0% Contractual Backlog $104,173 $106,591 $120,600 *Includes In-Process Research & Development in 2000 Revenues Revenues for 2002 were $54.1 billion compared with $58.2 billion in 2001 and $51.3 billion in 2000. The lower revenues in 2002 principally reflect decreased deliveries in the Commercial Airplanes segment. Fewer commercial airplane deliveries in 2002 were offset by growth of $1.5 billion in the Military Aircraft and Missile Systems segment revenues. The higher revenues in 2001 compared to 2000 principally reflect increased deliveries in the Commercial Airplanes segment, but also reflect an increase in Space and Communications segment revenues. Based on current schedules and plans, the Company projects total 2003 revenues to be approximately $49 billion. Operating Earnings Operating earnings for 2002 were $3,868 million compared with $3,896 million in 2001 and $3,058 million in 2000. 2001 operating earnings were significantly impacted by $935 million of pre-tax special charges related to the events of September 11, 2001. See Note 3. Excluding the September 11, 2001, special charges, operating earnings in 2002 would have been $963 million lower than 2001 operating earnings. This decrease in operating earnings reflected lower commercial airplane deliveries offset by production efficiencies in the Commercial Airplanes segment and higher deliveries of Military Aircraft and Missile Systems segment products. Space and Communications segment operating earnings also decreased as commercial satellite losses offset growth and performance on other programs. In addition, $426 million of asset impairment charges and additional valuation reserves related to customer and commercial financing assets were recorded by BCC and the Other segment during 2002. Operating earnings of $3,896 million for 2001 were $838 million higher than 2000 operating earnings of $3,058 million. Excluding the September 11, 2001, pre-tax special charges of $935 million, operating earnings in 2001 would have been $1,773 million higher than 2000 operating earnings. The increase in operating earnings during 2001 was primarily related to higher commercial airplane deliveries and an increase in Space and Communications segment operating earnings. - 17 - As indicated in Note 16, the Company has generated significant net periodic benefit income related to pensions: $404 million in 2002, $920 million in 2001, and $428 million in 2000. Not all net periodic pension benefit income or expense is recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and a portion remains in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Accordingly, the operating earnings for 2002, 2001 and 2000, included $537 million, $785 million and $403 million, respectively, of pension income. Due to the significant investment losses incurred in recent years, the expected future market-related value of assets is expected to decrease significantly in the near future. This decrease, when combined with the decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term asset return is expected to reduce pension income reflected in operating earnings from $537 million in 2002 to approximately $75 million in 2003. In 2004, the pension impact to earnings will depend on market conditions, but based upon current assumptions, the Company expects to recognize a non-cash pension expense estimated to range from $200 million to $300 million. Net Earnings Net earnings of $492 million for 2002 were $2,335 million lower than 2001 earnings of $2,827 million. The decrease in net earnings principally reflected a $1,827 million charge recorded in 2002 upon the adoption of SFAS No. 142, decreased commercial airplane deliveries, increased customer financing charges and higher commercial satellite production costs. Other income decreased $276 million in 2002, to $42 million in 2002 from $318 million in 2001. Other income in 2001 included $210 million of interest income associated with federal income tax audit settlements; 2002 did not include similar interest income. Also contributing to lower other income in 2002 was $46 million of losses on long-held equity investments. Interest and debt expense increased $80 million in 2002, to $730 million in 2002 from $650 million in 2001. The increased interest expense resulted from increased debt, primarily associated with the increased customer and commercial financing activities of BCC. Interest expense is expected to increase concurrent with increasing future financing activity. Net earnings of $2,827 million for 2001 were $699 million higher than 2000 net earnings of $2,128 million. The increase in net earnings principally reflected increased operating earnings associated with the increase in revenue for 2001. Net earnings in 2001 were significantly reduced by $935 million of pre-tax special charges ($633 million after tax) related to the events of September 11, 2001. The increase in net earnings for 2001 over 2000 also reflected the in-process research and development expense of $557 million ($348 million after tax) that was recognized in 2000, of which $500 million was associated with the acquisition of the Hughes space and communications businesses, which were renamed Boeing Satellite Systems. Other income decreased $68 million in 2001, to $318 million in 2001 from $386 million in 2000. The decrease in other income in 2001 principally reflected lower interest income from cash, but was partially offset by higher interest income associated with federal income tax audit settlements ($210 million in 2001, compared with $73 million in 2000). Other income in 2000 also included a $42 million gain on sale of a long-held equity investment. Interest and debt expense increased $205 million in 2001, to $650 million in 2001 from $445 million in 2000. The increased interest expense resulted from increased debt, primarily associated with the increased customer and commercial financing activities of BCC. Research and Development Research and development expenditures involve design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative commercial jet aircraft, advance space, other company-sponsored product development, and basic research and development. These expenditures are either charged directly against earnings or are included in amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. Government contracts. Research and development highlights for each of the major business segments are discussed in Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition. In addition, Boeing Technology, the advanced research and development organization of the Company, focuses on improving its competitive position by investing in certain technologies and processes that apply to multiple business units. Technology investments currently being pursued within Boeing Technology include network centric operations, affordable structures and manufacturing technology, lean and efficient design processes and tools, lean support and service initiatives, advanced platform systems and safe and clean products. - 18 - Total research and development expense in 2002 was $1,639 million, compared with $1,936 million in 2001 and $1,998 million in 2000. Excluding the $557 million of in-process research and development expense in 2000, research and development expense increased $495 million in 2001, principally reflecting increases in the Commercial Airplanes segment and the Other segment, which includes activities relating to Connexion by BoeingSM. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for 2002 was 27.1% compared with 20.7% in 2001 and 29.0% in 2000. The 2002 effective income tax rate of 27.1% varies from the federal statutory tax rate of 35%, principally due to Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) and Extraterritorial Income (ETI) Exclusion tax benefits of $195 million. This rate also reflects tax credits, state income taxes and favorable resolution of certain audit issues. The effective income tax rates of 20.7% for 2001 and 29.0% for 2000 also vary from the federal statutory tax rate principally due to FSC benefits of $222 million in 2001 and $291 million in 2000. The 2001 income tax rate also reflects a one-time benefit of $343 million reflecting a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) relating to research credit claims on McDonnell Douglas Corporation fixed price government contracts applicable to the 1986-1992 federal income tax returns. In December 1996, The Boeing Company filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington for the refund of over $400 million in federal income taxes and related interest. If the Company were to prevail, the refund of the amount in dispute would include interest computed to the payment date. However, the Company cannot predict the likelihood of a favorable outcome. The suit challenged the IRS method of allocating research and development costs for the purpose of determining tax incentive benefits on export sales through the Company’s Domestic International Sales Corporation (DISC) and its FSC for the years 1979 through 1987. The Company prevailed with the District Court, but lost an appeals decision with the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Company appealed to the Supreme Court and is awaiting their decision, which is expected in the first half of 2003. The Company’s financial statements will not be negatively impacted as a result of the suit’s outcome. Beginning in 1999 and continuing through 2002 the European Union (EU) has issued a series of objections with the World Trade Organization (WTO) to both U.S. FSC and ETI provisions. The WTO has agreed with the EU and ruled that the FSC and ETI provisions constitute prohibited export subsidies. In response the WTO has authorized the EU to impose retaliatory tariffs. A list of products upon which the retaliatory tariff would be imposed is not yet final, but at this point no Boeing products have been included on the list. President Bush has stated that the U.S. will bring its tax laws into compliance with the WTO ruling that the Extraterritorial Income regime constitutes a prohibited export subsidy. Both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee are continuing to assess alternatives for a replacement of the ETI legislation. It is not possible to predict what impact this issue will have on future earnings pending final resolution of these matters. If ETI is repealed and replacement legislation is not enacted, the loss of benefit to the Company could be substantial. Income taxes have been settled with the IRS for all years through 1978, and IRS examinations have been completed through 1991. In connection with these examinations, the Company disagrees with IRS proposed adjustments, and the years 1979 through 1987 are in litigation. The IRS examination for McDonnell Douglas Corporation for the years 1993 through 1995 has been settled and the Company received a refund of $102 million in 2002. The Company believes adequate provision for all outstanding issues has been made for all open years. - 19 - Backlog Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and foreign government contract funding. Total contractual backlog balances were $104.2 billion at December 31, 2002, $106.6 billion at December 31, 2001, and $120.6 billion at December 31, 2000. The decreases in contractual backlog from 2001 to 2002 and 2000 to 2001 were related to decreases in contractual backlog for Commercial Airplanes offset by increases in contractual backlog for both Space and Communications and Military Aircraft and Missile Systems. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and foreign government definitive contracts for which funding has not been appropriated. Unobligated backlog totaled $34.7 billion, $27.5 billion and $31.3 billion at December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in unobligated backlog from 2001 to 2002 is primarily related to Military Aircraft and Missile Systems, partially offset by Space and Communications. Overall, unobligated backlog decreased from 2000 to 2001 due to a decrease in unobligated backlog for Military Aircraft and Missile Systems, which was partially offset by an increase in unobligated backlog for Space and Communications. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary factors that affect the Company’s investment requirements and liquidity position, other than operating results associated with current sales activity, include the following: timing of new and derivative programs requiring both high developmental expenditures and initial inventory buildup; cyclical factors, including growth and expansion requirements and requirements associated with reducing sales levels; customer financing assistance; the timing of federal income tax payments; the Company’s stock repurchase plan; and potential acquisitions. Cash flow summary The Company has generated strong cash flow from operating activities with $4.4 billion provided in 2002, $3.9 billion in 2001 and $6.2 billion in 2000. Earnings, adjusted for non-cash items, continue to be the primary source of operating cash flow with over $4 billion provided in each of the last three years. (Dollars in millions) Year Ended December 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net earnings $ 492 $ 2,827 $ 2,128 Non-cash items 3,772 1,786 1,977 Changes in working capital 111 (719) 2,121 Net cash provided by operating activities 4,375 3,894 6,226 Net cash used by investing activities (3,421) (4,789) (7,911) Net cash provided (used) by financing activities 746 518 (659) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 1,700 (377) (2,344) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 633 1,010 3,354 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 2,333 $ 633 $ 1,010 Non-cash items Non-cash items in earnings primarily include depreciation, amortization, share-based plans expense, impairments, valuation provisions and the cumulative effect of accounting change relating to the adoption of SFAS No. 142. Non-cash items and corresponding amounts are listed in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Working capital Working capital from operations excluding cash contributions for pensions generated approximately $0.5 billion of net cash in 2002. Due to the decline in the airline industry, lower inventory balances and production rates resulted in a $1.5 billion increase in cash flow. The amount of customer advance payments received in excess of costs was $0.9 billion less in 2002 than the previous year due primarily to lower advance payments received. There was also a substantial reduction in vendor payables. The reduction in tax payments in 2002 resulted principally from lower earnings and a $0.1 billion tax refund from settlements of several tax audits. - 20 - The working capital trend as reflected in the Five-Year Summary indicates that the Company has been able to use lower amounts of working capital to support the volume of business transacted and is using capital more efficiently. This trend does not reflect a change in the Company’s ability to meet obligations. Pensions 2002 operating cash flow included $0.3 billion of cash funding to the pension plans. On April 15, 2002, the Company voluntarily funded three of its defined benefit plans to ensure that each of its plans would have assets that were at least approximately equal to (and in most cases greater than) the liability for vested benefits as measured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. The Company does not expect significant pension funding requirements in 2003, although it may make additional discretionary contributions. The Company measures its pension plan using a September 30 year-end for financial accounting purposes. The significant declines experienced in the financial markets have unfavorably impacted asset performance. As a result, the Company has reduced its expected long-term rate of asset return by 25 basis points to 9.0% beginning in 2003. The expected long-term rate of asset return is based on target asset allocations of 60% equity with a return of 10.0%, 30% fixed income with a return of 6.8%, and 10% other (including real estate) with a return of 9.2%. Current allocations are within 1 to 3% of each of the long-term targets. The decline in asset performance coupled with historically low interest rates (a key factor when estimating plan liabilities), caused the Company to recognize a significant non-cash charge to equity in the fourth quarter of 2002. This charge, which amounted to a $5.7 billion increase to the accrued pension plan liability and a $3.6 billion after tax decrease to the accumulated other comprehensive income account within shareholders’ equity, did not impact earnings or cash flow, and could reverse in future periods should either interest rates increase or market performance and plan returns improve. The Company uses a discount rate that is based on a point-in-time estimate as of the September 30 measurement date. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased 100 basis points, the pension and postretirement liability would have decreased $3.6 billion or increased $4.4 billion, respectively. Investing activities The majority of BCC’s customer financing is funded by debt and cash flow from its own operations. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had outstanding irrevocable commitments of approximately $3.2 billion to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order or under option for deliveries scheduled through the year 2007. Not all these commitments are likely to be used; however, a significant portion of these commitments are with parties with relatively low credit ratings. See Note 20 and 21. Outstanding loans and commitments are primarily secured by the underlying aircraft. Additional investments of $0.4 billion were made by BCC in Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs) offered by various airlines in 2002. EETCs are widely used in the airline industry as a method of financing aircraft. BCC provides financing for airlines and has begun investing in these types of instruments as an investor. See BCC Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Financing activities Debt maturities during this three-year period included $1.3 billion in 2002, $0.5 billion in 2001, and $0.5 billion in 2000. Additionally, BCC issued $2.8 billion of debt in 2002, $3.9 billion in 2001 and $2.0 billion in 2000. The significant BCC debt issuance in 2000 and 2001 was performed in conjunction with the transfer of a significant portion of the Company’s customer financing assets to BCC as well as growth in the customer financing portfolio. In 2002, BCC debt issuance was generally used for growth in the customer financing portfolio. The Company has a share repurchase program, but there were no share repurchases in 2002. See Note 18. - 21 - Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s known obligations to make future payments or other consideration pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2002, as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied. Contractual obligations (Dollars in millions) Total Less than 1year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5years Long-term debt $ 13,704 $ 1,377 $ 2,808 $ 2,843 $ 6,676 Capital lease obligations 699 437 120 116 26 Operating leases 1,915 349 497 373 696 Other long-term liabilities 12,247 291 2,743 2,762 6,451 Total contractual obligations $ 28,565 $ 2,454 $ 6,168 $ 6,094 $ 13,849 Other long-term liabilities in the table above include accrued retiree health care, accrued pension plan liability and deferred lease income. Inventory procurement contacts The Company has entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet the Company’s production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises due to the extended production planning horizon for many of its products, including commercial aircraft, military aircraft and other products where the delivery to the customer is over an extended period of time. A significant portion of these inventory commitments are either supported by a firm contract from a customer or have historically resulted in settlement through either termination payments or contract adjustments, when necessary, should the customer base not materialize to support delivery from the supplier. Although there are no plans to do so, if any of the Company’s programs were to be terminated, the Company would be exposed to potentially material termination costs. Industrial participation agreements The Company has entered into various industrial participation agreements with customers in foreign countries to effect economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from the Company. These commitments may be satisfied by the Company’s placement of direct work, placement of vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology, or other forms of assistance to the foreign country. The Company does not commit to industrial participation obligations unless a contract for sale of the Company’s products or services is signed. To be eligible for such a commitment from the Company, the foreign country or customer must have sufficient capability and capacity and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. In certain cases, if a contract is placed with a foreign supplier to satisfy an industrial participation obligation, failure of that supplier to comply with any or all of these terms and conditions relieves the Company of its obligations pursuant to that portion of its industrial participation commitment. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if the Company does not meet its industrial participation obligations. During 2002, no penalties were incurred by the Company. As of December 31, 2002, the Company has outstanding industrial participation obligations totaling approximately $8.2 billion that extend through 2013. Capital resources The Company has the following Standard & Poor's credit ratings: short-term, A-1; senior debt, A+. BCC has the following Standard & Poor's credit ratings: short-term, A-1; senior debt, A+. The Company has the following Moody's credit ratings: short-term, P-1; senior debt, A2. BCC has the following Moody's credit ratings: short-term, P-2; senior debt, A3. The Company has the following Fitch's credit ratings: short-term, F-1; senior debt, A+. BCC has the following Fitch's credit ratings: short-term, F-1; senior debt, A+. The events of September 11, 2001, negatively impacted the liquidity and capital resources of the Company. Subsequent to September 11, 2001, the Company established a commercial paper program providing additional short-term liquidity. Commercial paper remains a significant liquidity source. - 22 - The Company has debt obligations of $14.4 billion, which are unsecured. Approximately $1.8 billion will mature in 2003, and the balance has an average maturity of 12.4 years. Excluding BCC debt of $9.5 billion and non-recourse debt of $0.6 billion, total debt is at 42% of total shareholders’ equity plus debt. The consolidated debt, including BCC, is at 65% of total shareholders’ equity plus debt. As previously noted, the Company has recognized a significant non-cash charge to equity of $3.6 billion, net of tax. Excluding this item and BCC debt, the consolidated debt was 31% of shareholders’ equity plus debt. The Company has additional substantial borrowing capability. Currently, the Company has $4.3 billion that remains available from shelf registrations filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and $4.5 billion ($2.0 billion exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements with a group of major banks. See Note 15. The Company believes its internally generated liquidity, together with access to external capital resources, will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. Due to the continuing downturn in the commercial aviation market and the recent airline announcements in the United States that confirm the delayed recovery of airline traffic and profitability, several customers have rescheduled aircraft delivery dates. The rescheduling of delivery dates will reduce aircraft advance payments in the near term. The reduction in advance payments will be offset by reduced inventory spending, resulting in an immaterial impact on the Company’s liquidity. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company is a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the SEC, including certain guarantees and variable interests in unconsolidated entities. Guarantees The following tables provide quantitative data regarding the Company’s third-party guarantees. The maximum potential payment amounts represent “worst-case scenarios,” and do not necessarily reflect results expected by the Company. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets the Company could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset its payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet reflects the Company’s best estimate of future payments it may be required to make as part of fulfilling its guarantee obligations. Portions of certain liabilities were established in prior periods as part of the Company’s special charges due to the events of September 11, 2001. As of December 31, 2002, MaximumPotentialPayments EstimatedProceeds fromCollateral/Recourse CarryingAmounts ofLiabilities* Portion ofLiabilitiesRelated to theEvents of Septemer 11, 2001 Asset-related guarantees $ 790 $ 629 $ 17 $ 7 Credit guarantees related to the Sea Launch venture 535 186 200 Other credit guarantees 245 72 19 Equipment trust certificates 182 101 Performance guarantees 57 1 *Amounts included in accounts payable and other liabilities The Company has issued various asset-related guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale of certain commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, the Company is obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event the related aircraft fair values fall below a specified amount at a future point in time. These obligations are collateralized principally by commercial aircraft. No aircraft have been delivered with these types of guarantees in several years. Recent declines in asset values of commercial aircraft increase the risk of future payment by the Company under these guarantees. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded a reduction to expense of $3 million and made net cash payments totaling $138 million related to its asset-related guarantees. - 23 - The Company has issued credit guarantees to creditors of the Sea Launch venture, of which the Company is a 40% owner, to assist the venture in obtaining financing. In the event the Company is required to perform on these guarantees, it has the right to recover a portion of the loss from another venture partner, and has collateral rights to certain assets of the venture. In addition, the Company has issued credit guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale of certain commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, the Company is obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original debtor or lessee. The Company’s commercial aircraft credit-related guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft. A substantial portion of these guarantees have been extended on behalf of original debtors or lessees with less than investment-grade credit. Recent financial weakness in certain airlines further exposes the Company to loss under its credit guarantees. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded no expenses and made net cash payments totaling $9 million related to its credit guarantees. As a liquidity provider for equipment trust certificate (ETC) pass-through arrangements, the Company has certain obligations to investors in the trusts, which requires funding to the trust to cover interest due to such investors resulting from an event of default by United Airlines. In the event of funding, the Company receives a first priority position in the ETC collateral in the amount of the funding. On February 7, 2003, the Company advanced $101 million to the trust perfecting its collateral position and terminating its liquidity obligation. The trust currently has collateral value that significantly exceeds the amount due to the Company. Also relating to an ETC investment, the Company has potential obligations relating to shortfall interest payments in the event that the interest rates in the underlying agreements are reset below a certain level. These obligations would cease if United Airlines were to default on its interest payments to the trust. There were no significant payments made by the Company during 2002. The Company has outstanding performance guarantees issued in conjunction with joint venture investments. Pursuant to these guarantees, the Company would be required to make payments in the event a third-party fails to perform specified services. Material variable interests in unconsolidated entities The Company is currently assessing the application of FIN 46 as it relates to its variable interests. While the Company is currently not required to consolidate the full amount of the ETCs, EETCs or the Sea Launch venture in which it has invested, it is unable to definitively conclude at this time whether consolidation or disclosure will be required for these investments upon full adoption of FIN 46. The Company’s investment in ETCs and EETCs aggregated $455 million at December 31, 2002. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recorded revenues of $25 million, cash inflows of $41 million, and impairment expense of $79 million relating to these investments. As of December 31, 2002, the VIE (ETCs and EETCs) in which the Company has invested have total assets of approximately $4.2 billion and total debt (which is non-recourse to the Company) of approximately $3.7 billion. The total assets and total liabilities of the Sea Launch venture each represent less than 4% of the Company’s consolidated total assets and total liabilities as of December 31, 2002. The Company made no additional capital contributions to the Sea Launch venture during the year ended December 31, 2002. Disclosures about commercial commitments The following table summarizes the Company’s commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2002, as well as an estimate of the timing in which these commitments are expected to expire. Commercial commitments (Dollars in millions) Total AmountsCommitted/Maximum Amount of Loss Less than 1year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $ 1,663 $ 1,079 $ 221 $ 70 $ 293 Guarantees: Asset-related guarantees 790 63 60 667 Credit guarantees 780 4 40 614 122 Equipment trust certificates 182 182 Performance guarantees 57 12 33 12 Trade-in commitments 1,993 617 1,054 220 102 Other commercial commitments 3,329 1,569 1,715 45 Total commercial commitments $ 8,794 $ 3,344 $ 3,063 $ 964 $ 1,423 - 24 - Related to the issuance of certain standby letters of credit and surety bonds included in the above table, the Company received $608 million of advance payments from customers. The Company enters into certain trade-in agreements to purchase used aircraft from customers at a specific price at a future point in time when those customers purchase new aircraft from the Company. In the event the Company accepts an aircraft under a trade-in agreement, the aircraft purchased by the Company serves as collateral to offset amounts paid by the Company to the customer. As of December 31, 2002, accounts payable and other liabilities included $156 million related to trade-in commitments, of which $93 million was related to the events of September 11, 2001. The total contractual trade-in value of all aircraft that customers had the right to sell to the Company was $1,993 million as of December 31, 2002, and the Company estimated the fair value of those aircraft was $1,837 million. There is a high degree of uncertainty inherent in the assessment of the likelihood of trade-in commitments. Generally, as commercial aircraft values decline, the probability of the Company’s performance on trade-in commitments increases. There have been recent declines in value for certain aircraft models, including those for which the Company has trade-in agreements. Updates on the likelihood that trade-in commitments will be exercised using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources are continually assessed. The Company continues to monitor all trade-in commitments for adverse developments. Other commercial commitments include irrevocable financing commitments related to aircraft on order and commercial equipment financing. These are previously discussed and also disclosed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Commercial Airplanes (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $28,387 $35,056 $31,171 % Of Total Company Revenues 53% 60% 61% Unit Cost Method Operating Earnings $2,847 $2,632 $2,736 Operating Margins 10.0% 7.5% 8.8% Program Accounting Method Operating Earnings $2,017 $1,911 $2,099 Operating Margins 7.1% 5.5% 6.7% Research and Development $768 $858 $574 Contractual Backlog $68,159 $75,850 $89,780 Revenues Commercial Airplanes segment revenues were $28.4 billion in 2002 compared with $35.1 billion in 2001 and $31.2 billion for 2000. Commercial Airplanes revenue is derived primarily from jet aircraft deliveries. The decline in revenue in 2002 compared to 2001 was due primarily to the decline in the commercial aviation market and resulting jet aircraft deliveries and revenue. 2001 revenue was higher than in 2000 due primarily to the increase in commercial jet aircraft deliveries. Commercial jet aircraft deliveries were 381 in 2002 compared with 527 in 2001 and 489 in 2000 summarized as follows: Model 2002 2001 2000 717 20 49 (10) 32 (23) 737 Classic - - 2 737 Next-Generation 223 (2) 299 (5) 279 747 27 (1) 31 (1) 25 757 29 45 45 767 35 (1) 40 44 777 47 61 55 MD-11 - 2 4 MD-90 - - 3 Total 381 527 489 - 25 - Commercial jet aircraft deliveries included deliveries under operating lease, which are identified by parentheses in the table above. Deliveries in 2002 included intercompany deliveries of four 737 Next-Generation aircraft, consisting of three C-40 aircraft and one Project Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) System aircraft. Deliveries in 2001 included intercompany deliveries of two 737 Next-Generation aircraft, and in 2000 included intercompany deliveries of four 737 Next-Generation aircraft and one 747 aircraft. Final deliveries of the MD-11 aircraft program occurred in 2001. Final deliveries of the 737 Classic and MD-90 aircraft programs occurred in 2000. The cumulative number of commercial aircraft deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: Model 2002 2001 2000 717 113 93 44 737 Next-Generation 1,247 1,024 725 747 1,319 1,292 1,261 757 1,022 993 948 767 892 857 817 777 424 377 316 The undelivered units under firm order* as of December 31 were as follows: Model 2002 2001 2000 717 26 30 107 737 Next-Generation 765 857 997 747 52 59 77 757 28 55 94 767 39 77 82 777 173 198 241 * Firm orders represent new aircraft purchase agreements where the customers’ rights to cancel without penalty have expired. Typical customer rights to cancel without penalty include receiving Board of Directors’ approval, shareholder approval, government approval and completing financing arrangements. All such cancellation rights must be satisfied or expired even if satisfying such conditions are highly certain. Firm orders exclude option aircraft and aircraft subject to reconfirmation. Total commercial jet aircraft deliveries for 2003 are currently projected to approximate 280 aircraft. For 2004, commercial aircraft deliveries are currently projected to be in the range of 275 to 300 aircraft. As of January 30, 2003, the delivery forecast for 2003 is virtually sold out and approximately 80% sold for 2004 at the lower end of the range. Commercial Airplanes segment revenues for 2003 are projected to be in the range of $22 billion. Operating Earnings Commercial Airplanes segment calculates its operating earnings using both the unit cost and program accounting methods. For segment reporting purposes, as disclosed in Note 24, the Commercial Airplanes operating earnings as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, are provided on the unit cost basis. Beginning in first quarter 2003, Commercial Airplanes segment data will be based on the program accounting method. Commercial Airplanes segment 2002 operating earnings, based on the unit cost of airplanes delivered, were $2,847 million, compared with $2,632 million in 2001 and $2,736 million in 2000. The related operating margins were 10.0%, 7.5% and 8.8%, respectively. 2002 and 2001 operating earnings included $(2) million and $908 million, respectively, of (recoveries)/charges associated with the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Excluding these (recoveries)/charges, Commercial Airplanes segment operating earnings in 2002 and 2001 were $2,845 million and $3,540 million, resulting in operating margins of 10.0% and 10.1%, respectively. Excluding the September 11 (recoveries)/charges, 2002 operating margin was slightly lower than 2001 due to the decline in revenue offset by improved operating efficiency and reduced research and development expense. 2001 operating earnings and margin, excluding September 11 charges, increased from 2000 principally due to increased revenue and continued improvement in the production process. - 26 - Commercial Airplanes segment operating earnings, based on the program method of accounting and including intercompany transactions, as discussed in Note 24, were $2,017 million, $1,911 million and $2,099 million as of December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The related operating margins were 7.1%, 5.5%, and 6.7%. Excluding the 2002 and 2001 (recoveries)/charges associated with September 11, 2001, the operating earnings for these periods were $2,015 million and $2,819 million, respectively. The comparable margins were 7.1% and 8.0%. The decline in margins from 2001 to 2002 is primarily due to the reduction in revenue offset by improved operating efficiency and reduced research and development expense. In addition, the margins have been adversely impacted compared to 2001 due to the aircraft market decline. In general, this has resulted in the lengthening of the time needed to produce the accounting quantity. Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which do not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity increases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also increases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates, thus reducing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. The favorable cost performance reflected in the current year earnings and margin is recognized over current and future deliveries under the program method of accounting. For segment reporting purposes, the favorable cost performance is a cumulative adjustment to unit cost over current and prior deliveries. The Company will continue to experience a higher than normal quantity of used airplanes through 2003 as a result of commitments entered into through purchase agreements with customers for new aircraft and services. Due to the current market for used airplanes, the Company’s used airplane inventory may increase and these purchases and commitments to purchase may result in future charges. Accounting Quantity A program consists of the estimated accounting quantity for each aircraft to be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The Company has a policy that determines the appropriate accounting quantity for each commercial aircraft program. This policy takes into account several factors influenced by the demand for the particular product. The Company reviews and reassesses its program accounting quantities on a quarterly basis in compliance with relevant program accounting guidance. The current market for commercial aircraft is adversely affecting all of Commercial Airplanes commercial aircraft programs. The resulting reduction in production rates is extending the time frame for production and delivery of the accounting quantities used for program accounting. This is particularly true for the 747, 757 and 767 programs. The 757 and 767 programs have been experiencing the most difficulty acquiring new orders. Current market projections indicate that the Company will be successful in selling the unsold units within the current accounting quantity for all programs, therefore no accounting quantities have been reduced. The estimate of total program accounting quantities and changes, if any, as of December 31 were: 717 737 Next-Generation 747 757 767 777 2002 140 2,000 1,401 1,100 1,000 600 Additions 5 200 2001 135 1,800 1,401 1,100 1,000 600 Additions/(deletions) (65) 150 50 50 50 2000 200 1,650 1,351 1,050 950 600 The accounting quantity for the 717 program continues to be based on firm orders as it has been since fourth quarter of 2001. The increase of five units in the 717 program accounting quantity during the second quarter of 2002 was the result of net new order activity on the program. The reduction of 65 units in the 717 program accounting quantity during the fourth quarter of 2001 was driven by a lack of firm demand for the 717 aircraft subsequent to September 11, 2001. See Note 3. This decrease in demand is demonstrated in the table below by the sharp decrease in the 717 program’s anticipated orders as a percentage of cumulative firm orders between December 31, 2001 and December 31, 2000. Program accounting quantity increases between December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2000 on other programs were the result of the normal progression of business; delivering aircraft; and obtaining additional orders. - 27 - Within the accounting quantity for all programs there are units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these conditions within the accounting quantity must be addressed. The percentage of anticipated orders included in the program accounting estimates as compared to the number of cumulative firm orders* as of December 31 were as follows: 717 737 Next-Generation 747 757 767 777 2002 Cumulative firm orders (CFO) 139 2,012 1,371 1,050 931 597 Anticipated orders 0 n/a 29 49 67 3 Anticipated orders as a % CFO 0% n/a 2% 5% 7% 1% 2001 Cumulative firm orders (CFO) 123 1,881 1,351 1,048 934 575 Anticipated orders 11 n/a 49 51 64 25 Anticipated orders as a % CFO 9% n/a 4% 5% 7% 4% 2000 Cumulative firm orders (CFO) 151 1,722 1,338 1,042 899 557 Anticipated orders 48 n/a 12 7 49 43 Anticipated orders as a % CFO 32% n/a 1% 1% 5% 8% * Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31 (see table on page 26) plus undelivered units under firm order (see table on page 26). Cumulative firm orders include orders that fall within the current accounting quantities as well as orders that extend beyond the current accounting quantities. Cumulative firm orders exclude program test aircraft that will not be refurbished for sale. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had cumulatively delivered 113 717 program aircraft. The Company will record 717 deliveries on a break-even basis until such time as program reviews indicate changes to the gross margin. The Company has potentially material exposures related to the 717 program, principally attributable to termination costs that could result from a lack of longer-term market acceptance. The Company is anticipating an order from the U.S. Air Force for 100 767 tankers, which will have a long-term positive impact on the 767 program. This order has been incorporated into the program estimates to the extent the aircraft fall within the current accounting quantity. Based on the anticipated delivery schedule and forecasted production rates most of these aircraft fall beyond the current accounting quantity. The order from the U.S. Air Force for 100 767 tankers is anticipated to become a firm contract during 2003. Deferred Production Costs Inventory production costs incurred on in-process and delivered units in excess of the estimated average cost of such units determined as described in Note 1 represent deferred production costs. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, there were no significant excess deferred production costs or unamortized tooling costs not recoverable from existing firm orders for the 737 Next-Generation and 777 programs. The unamortized tooling and deferred production costs included in inventory at December 31are summarized in the following table: 2002 2001 Unamortized tooling 737 Next-Generation $ 239 $ 305 777 709 821 Deferred production costs 737 Next-Generation 57 429 777 785 863 As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, the balance of deferred production costs and unamortized tooling related to the 717, 747, 757 and 767 programs was insignificant. - 28 - Fleet Support The Company provides the operators of all its commercial airplane models assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals and technical consulting support, and continues throughout the operational life of the aircraft. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model’s fleet. Field service support involves Company personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. Research and Development The Company continually evaluates opportunities to improve current aircraft models, and assesses the marketplace to ensure that its family of commercial jet aircraft are well positioned to meet future requirements of the airline industry. The fundamental strategy is to maintain a broad product line that is responsive to changing market conditions by maximizing commonality among the Boeing family of commercial aircraft. Additionally, the Company is determined to continue to lead the industry in customer satisfaction by offering products with the highest standards of quality, safety, technical excellence, economic performance and in-service support. Commercial Airplanes segment research and development expense was $768 million in 2002, $858 million in 2001 and $574 million in 2000. The decrease in 2002 from 2001 was due primarily to reduced spending on the development of the 777-300ER and 747-400ER. The increase in 2001 over 2000 was due primarily to increased spending on the development of the 777-300ER, 777-200LR, 747-400ER and a sonic cruiser airplane. The initial delivery of the 747-400ER and the rollout of the first 777-300ER occurred in the fourth quarter of 2002. The initial delivery of the 777-300ER is expected to occur in 2004. The initial delivery of the 737-900, the largest member of the 737 Next-Generation family occurred in the second quarter of 2001. The initial delivery of the 767-400ER, a stretched version of 767-300ER, occurred in the third quarter of 2000. In the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company announced it will focus its product development efforts on the development of an efficient 200- to 250-seat airplane that will fly 7,000 to 8,000 nautical miles with 15 to 20 percent lower fuel usage at the top end of today’s commercial jet speeds. The market potential for a new airplane of this size is forecasted at up to 3,000 units over the next 20 years. The Company expects to formally offer the new airplane to customers in early 2004, with entry into service targeted for 2008. The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Backlog Commercial Airplanes segment contractual firm backlog balances were $68.2 billion at December 31, 2002, $75.9 billion at December 31, 2001, and $89.8 billion at December 31, 2000. Contractual firm backlog for Commercial Airplanes segment excludes customers deemed by management to be high risk or in bankruptcy as of the reporting date. The contractual backlog decline reflects the impact that the economic downturn has had on the airline industry. The decline in backlog of $7.7 billion from December 31, 2001 to December 31, 2002, and $13.9 billion from December 31, 2000 and December 31, 2001, represents higher delivery volume on all airplane programs relative to new orders. December 31, 2002, backlog does not include the anticipated order of 100 U.S. Air Force 767 tankers. This order is anticipated to become a firm contract during 2003. - 29 - Business Environment and Trends Overview The worldwide market for commercial jet airplanes continues to be predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth, both in developed and emerging countries, and political stability. Demand for the Company’s commercial airplanes is further influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, environmental constraints imposed upon airplane operations, technological changes, and price and other competitive factors. Airline industry environment Commercial aviation has been impacted by an economic downturn that began in 2001 and continued through 2002. In addition, the industry suffered a tremendous shock from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Air travel in most areas of the world has not recovered to the volume carried by the airlines in 2000, which is affecting profitability for many airlines. U.S. full service airlines have suffered the greatest losses. Holiday traffic in 2002 for the U.S. airlines showed an improvement and most carriers indicated better financial performance. However, this improvement was for only a short period of time and the major U.S. full service airlines reported significant losses for 2002. In contrast, low fare airlines in the U.S. and in Europe are reporting positive financial results and are growing. European network airlines are expected to show better results than their U.S. counterparts for the fiscal period ending in March of 2003. Traffic between Asia and Europe has rebounded to pre-September 11 levels. This trend combined with stronger traffic within the region is offsetting the slow growth over the Pacific permitting most Asian airlines to show profits. Our timetable for industry recovery has been delayed. We presently see 2003 to be the year of recovery for world air travel; late 2003/early 2004 to be the year of airline profitability recovery; 2004 to be the year of airplane order recovery; and 2005 to be the year of delivery recovery. The major uncertainty that is curbing economic growth and a stronger and sooner rebound in the industry is the Iraqi situation – in terms of timing, scale of military engagement, effect on oil prices, and clarity of political resolution. The Company’s 20-year forecast of the average long-term growth rate in passenger traffic is 4.9% annually, based on projected average worldwide annual economic real growth of 2.9%. Based on global economic growth projections over the long term, and taking into consideration an increasingly competitive environment, increasing utilization levels of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, the Company projected almost a $5 trillion market for new airplanes and services over the next 20 years. This is a long-term forecast; historically, while factors such as the Gulf War and ticket charges for security have had significant impact over the span of several years, they have not dramatically affected the longer term trends in the world economy, and therefore, the Company’s market outlook. Airline deregulation Worldwide, the airline industry has experienced progressive deregulation of domestic markets and increasing liberalization of international markets. Twenty-five years ago virtually all air travel took place within a framework of domestic and international regulatory oversight. Since then, an increasing number of countries, most notably the United States, Australia, Japan and the countries in Western Europe, have eliminated restrictive regulations for domestic airline markets and promoted a more open-market climate for international services. These trends are expected to continue, but at varying rates in different parts of the world. At the end of the next decade, an estimated two-thirds of air travel will be in open markets. Liberalization of government regulations, together with increased airplane range capabilities, gives airlines greater freedom to pursue optimal fleet-mix strategies. This increased flexibility allows the airlines to accommodate traffic growth by selecting the best mix of flight frequencies and airplane size and capabilities for their route systems. In intercontinental markets, more liberal bilateral air service agreements provide an important stimulus to opening new city-pair markets, which favor increased flight frequency over capacity growth. In parallel with regulatory liberalization, improvements in airplane range performance will continue to allow airlines to expand the number of direct city-to-city routes, thus reducing the reliance on indirect routes through central hubs that require larger capacity airplanes. - 30 - Industry competitiveness The Company currently faces aggressive international competitors that are seeking to increase market share. This competitive factor was demonstrated by the decision of Airbus to introduce the A380, a proposed aircraft with passenger seating greater than the 747, to increase market share at the upper end of the large airplane market. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors. The Company’s focus on improving processes and other cost reduction efforts is intended to enhance its ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable the Company to maintain leadership at satisfactory margins. Additionally, the Company’s extensive customer support services network for airlines throughout the world plays a key role in maintaining high customer satisfaction. As an example, on-line access is available to all airline customers for engineering drawings, parts lists, service bulletins and maintenance manuals. The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Competitive pressures and increased lower-fare travel have combined to cause a long-term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms). Market liberalization within Europe has enabled low-cost airlines to enter the market. These airlines increase the downward pressure on airfares, similar to the competitive environment in the United States. Airfares between Asia and the United States are among the lowest yield (airfare divided by revenue passenger miles) of any in the world. These factors result in continued price pressure on the Company’s products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. In July 2000, three major European aerospace companies (Aerospatiale Matra of France, DaimlerChrysler Aerospace of Germany, and Construcciones Aeronautica of Spain) combined to form the European Aeronautic Defence and Space Company (EADS). As a result of the formation, EADS became an 80% owner of Airbus Industrie (AI) and led the effort for the formation of the Airbus Integrated Company (AIC) in early 2001. The creation of the AIC effectively changes the Airbus role, from that of a marketer/distributor of large commercial airplanes to one including complete manufacturing responsibility. The AIC is incorporated under French law as a privately held corporation owned 80% by EADS and 20% by BAE Systems. Over the past five years, sales outside the United States have accounted for approximately 53% of the Company’s total Commercial Airplanes’ third-party segment sales; approximately 50% of the Commercial Airplanes segment contractual backlog as of December 31, 2002, was with customers based outside the United States. Continued access to global markets remains vital to the Company’s ability to fully realize its sales potential and projected long-term investment returns. Summary Although near-term market uncertainties remain, particularly with respect to the recovery post September 11, the long-term market outlook appears favorable. The Company is well positioned in all segments of the commercial jet airplane market, and intends to remain the airline industry’s preferred supplier through emphasis on product offerings and customer service that provide the best overall value in the industry. Military Aircraft and Missile Systems (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $13,990 $12,451 $11,924 % Of Total Company Revenues 26% 21% 23% Operating Earnings $1,652 $1,346 $1,245 Operating Margins 11.8% 10.8% 10.4% Research and Development $345 $258 $257 Contractual Backlog $21,073 $17,630 $17,113 Revenues Military Aircraft and Missile Systems segment revenues were $14.0 billion in 2002, $12.5 billion in 2001 and $11.9 billion in 2000. Increased revenues in 2002 were primarily due to additional deliveries on the C-17 Globemaster, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 Eagle, JDAM, AH-64 Apache programs and increased Aerospace Support volume. The Military Aircraft and Missile Systems business segment is broadly diversified, and no program other than the C-17 Globemaster program and the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet program accounted for more than 6% of total 2002 segment revenues. Revenues include amounts attributable to production programs and amounts recognized on a cost-reimbursement basis for developmental programs such as the F/A-22 Raptor, V-22 Osprey, and the RAH-66 Comanche. The increase in revenues between 2001 and 2000 is primarily due to increased aircraft deliveries in 2001, one additional C-17 Globemaster, four 737 C-40A Clippers and four CH-47 Chinook helicopters. - 31 - Deliveries of units for principal production programs, including deliveries under operating lease, which are identified by parentheses, were as follows: Model 2002 2001 2000 C-17 Globemaster 16 14 (4) 13 F/A-18E/F Super Hornet 40 36 26 T-45TS Goshawk 14 15 16 F-15E Eagle 3 - 5 CH-47 Chinook 7 11 7 737 C-40A Clipper 3 4 - AH-64 Apache 15 7 8 Military Aircraft and Missile Systems segment revenues for 2003 are projected to be in the $14 billion range. Operating Earnings Military Aircraft and Missile Systems segment operating earnings for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were $1,652 million, $1,346 million and $1,245 million, respectively. The segment operating margins for 2002, 2001 and 2000 were 11.8%, 10.8% and 10.4%, respectively. The 2002 operating results reflect strong profits on major production programs. The segment operating margins for 2002 were 11.2% after adjusting for gains of $64 million related to the divestiture of equity investments and a favorable adjustment of $24 million attributable to F-15 Eagle program charges taken in 1999. Increased earnings in 2001 from 2000 were associated with the additional delivery of one C-17 Globemaster, four 737 C-40A Clippers and four CH-47 deliveries. The segment operating earnings for 2001 include the recognition of $48 million of charges relating to asset reductions attributable to reduced work volume at the Philadelphia site, and $46 million of charges associated with the Joint Strike Fighter program and idle manufacturing assets. The 2001 operating earnings also included a favorable adjustment of $57 million attributable to F-15 Eagle program charges taken in 1999. Exclusive of these items, the segment operating margins for 2001 were 11.1%. Research and Development The Company is continuing to invest in business opportunities where it can use its customer knowledge, technical strength and large-scale systems integration capabilities to shape the market. Investments in Unmanned Systems continue to leverage the Company’s capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies to provide transformational capabilities for the U.S. military. Investment is continuing in the 767 Tanker programs for the U.S. Air Force and international customers. Company investments in Airborne Electronic Attack and Precision Weapons and advanced Rotorcraft systems are expanding its breadth of products and capabilities enabling it to access larger portions of the combat systems markets. Military Aircraft and Missile Systems research and development expense in 2002 was $345 million, compared with $258 million in 2001 and $257 million in 2000. Current research and development activities are focused on the international and domestic 767 Tanker program, reflected in the 2002 increased expenditures over 2001. This program represents a large opportunity to provide state of the art tanking capabilities to our potential domestic and international customers. It demonstrates the synergistic value of the diversified Boeing portfolio in providing best value solutions to our customers. Italy recently became the first customer of the 767 tanker ordering four aircraft with first aircraft delivery scheduled in 2005. The Military Aircraft and Missile Systems segment continues to pursue business opportunities where it can use its customer knowledge, technical strength and large-scale integration capabilities. The segment’s level of research and development expenditures is consistent with this approach, and reflects the recent business environment, which has presented few major new-start opportunities. Other research and development efforts include upgrade and technology insertions to enhance the capability and competitiveness of current product lines, as well as exploration of new markets such as unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). - 32 - Backlog Total contractual backlog for Military Aircraft and Missile Systems was $21.1 billion at December 31, 2002, $17.6 billion at December 31, 2001 and $17.1 billion at December 31, 2000. Military Aircraft and Missiles Systems contractual backlog increased by 20% in 2002 compared to 2001. The increase in 2002 compared to 2001 is primarily attributed to the capture of several key international awards including the Korean F-15 Eagle contract and the Italian 767 Tanker contract. Backlog also increased due to rate increases on several domestic programs in low rate initial production including V-22 Osprey and the F/A-22 Raptor. The C-17 Globemaster program maintained consistent backlog as new orders replaced sales on the existing production contracts. The program is well positioned for continued sales well into this decade. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet program backlog increased moderately as the customer continues to increase production rate. The JDAM program backlog also increased moderately with additional orders from both the Navy and Air Force. Aerospace Support orders continued to increase this past year. Business Environment and Trends Overview The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), represents nearly 50% of the world’s defense budget, and remains the principal customer of the Military Aircraft and Missile Systems business unit. Several trends are emerging that are shaping customer behavior in this market. U.S. military force structure is shrinking, its platforms are aging, and the tempo of operations and engagements worldwide remains high. The United States’ current military activity demonstrates the value of systems solutions that allow all systems to communicate with each other, to operate over longer ranges, are unmanned and provide the advantages of precision, persistence and selective engagement. These factors are driving the U.S. DoD, along with militaries worldwide, to focus on ways to transform their forces and the way they operate. Military Transformation The transformation in forces is evidenced by a trend toward smaller, but more capable and more technologically advanced force structures. The transformation in acquisition is evidenced by an increasing trend toward spiral development programs, cooperative international development programs and a demonstrated willingness to explore new forms of acquisition and ownership including the lease of military support aircraft. Institutions and events continue to shape the defense industrial environment. From an institutional perspective, the establishment of the Homeland Defense and U.S. Northern Command are creating new organizations with responsibilities for national airspace control, coastal protection and civil support. The creation of the U.S. Strategic Command is consolidating responsibilities for global strike, integrated missile defense, information operations, command, control, communications and computers, and intelligence, surveillance and reconnaisance into a single organization. Events like Operation Enduring Freedom and the continuing war on global terrorism reaffirms the need for the rapid projection of decisive combat power around the world and emphasizes the need for new capabilities and solutions for the warfighter. Toward that end, the DoD is fully committed to a transformation that will achieve and maintain advantages through changes in operational concepts, organizational structure and technologies that significantly improve warfighting capabilities. Competitive environment The global competitive environment continues to intensify, with increased focus on the U.S. defense market, the world’s largest and most attractive. Military Aircraft and Missile Systems faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, EADS and Northrop Grumman. The financial problems plaguing some domestic industry competitors appear to be resolved, enabling them to acquire new assets and compete more vigorously. EADS continues to strategically build a presence in the U.S. market through building its North American operations and by partnering with U.S. defense companies. Continued industry consolidation and market concentration was marked by the acquisition of TRW by Northrop Grumman. Northrop’s position in the UAV, space, systems integration, and strike markets has been strengthened. However, all prime contractors continue to partner or serve as major suppliers to each other on various programs. At the lower tiers, consolidation persists and select companies have been positioning for larger roles, especially in the Aerospace Support market. In addition to leveraging its internal resources and capabilities, the Company is creating a competitive advantage by developing global strategic relationships to provide superior value for its customers, both in the U.S. and abroad. - 33 - Summary Events like nuclear proliferation in North Korea, Operation Enduring Freedom and the continued war on terrorism, highlight the fact that our National Security goals are not rhetorical. There is an immediate and a durable need to maintain strong U.S. defense capabilities covering a very broad spectrum of threats and responses. Near-term DoD budgets have increased, and longer-range forecasts expect DoD budgets to grow faster than anticipated prior to September 11, 2001. However, with a softening global economy and anticipated federal budget tensions, allocations to DoD procurement are unlikely to increase significantly. This suggests that the DoD will continue to focus on affordability strategies emphasizing network-centric operations, long range strike, unmanned air combat and reconnaissance vehicles, precision guided weapons and continued privatization of logistics and support activities as a means to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. The Company’s capabilities and programs are well suited to provide the military capabilities essential to meet the challenges facing our nation. Space and Communications (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $10,967 $10,364 $8,039 % Of Total Company Revenues 20% 18% 16% Operating Earnings (Loss) $357 $619 $(243) Operating Margins 3.3% 6.0% (3.0%) Research and Development $397 $526 $526 Contractual Backlog $14,941 $13,111 $13,707 Revenues Space and Communications segment revenues were $11.0 billion in 2002, compared with $10.4 billion in 2001 and $8.0 billion in 2000. The segment remains broadly diversified. The contributors to 2002 Space and Communications segment revenues included five market segments: Integrated Battlespace, Missile Defense, Human Space Flight and Exploration, Launch and Satellite and Homeland Security. The increase in revenues from 2001 to 2002 was primarily due to increased activity in Missile Defense offset by decreases in Launch and Satellite due to continued market downturn. 2001 revenues were higher than 2000 revenues due primarily to increased activity on Integrated Battlespace programs and the acquisition of Boeing Satellite Systems (BSS) in October 2000. Deliveries of production units were as follows: Model 2002 2001 2000 Delta II 3 12 10 Delta IV 1 - - BSS Satellites 6 7 5 Space and Communications segment revenues for 2003 are projected to be in the $12 billion range. The greatest growth is expected in the Integrated Battlespace market as Space and Communications has become the DoD’s leading industry partner in executing the military transformation with the capture of the Future Combat Systems program, Joint Tactical Radio System, and the Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals program. Missile Defense expects continued growth as the Missile Defense Agency continues its emphasis on the development of various missile defense capabilities. Operating Earnings Space and Communications segment operating earnings for 2002 were $357 million compared with $619 million in 2001 and $(243) million in 2000, and the related operating margins were 3.3%, 6.0% and (3.0)% for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The 2002 operating results include a $100 million pre-tax charge to write-down an equity investment in Teledesic, LLC. Also contributing to the 2002 decreased operating earnings was cost growth on Satellite programs and the continued downturn in the Launch and Commercial Satellite market. The 2000 operating results included a pre-tax charge of $505 million associated with the in-process research and development from the acquisition of the Hughes space and communications businesses and Autometric businesses, along with $78 million in costs associated with a Delta III demonstration launch in August 2000. The 2002 segment operating margins were reduced from 2001 due to factory cost, schedule performance and a satellite contract termination in the commercial satellite business along with 737 AEW&C development cost growth. The reduced 2002 margins were offset by favorable commercial space contract actions, improved margins for Integrated Battlespace, and Ground-based Midcourse Defense program performance. The 2001 operating margins were improved over the 2000 operating margins primarily due to reduced new product development expenses associated with the Delta IV RS-68 engine as it completed developmental engine certification and transitioned to production. The Company projects that 2003 operating earnings will continue to be impacted by new program development expenses but to a lesser degree than in prior years, primarily due to the transition of the Delta IV launch vehicle into production. - 34 - In February 2002, Space and Communications undertook a reorganization of its commercial satellite manufacturing activities in response to poor performance compounded by unfavorable market conditions. The impact to earnings by Satellite program cost growth was partially offset by favorable contractual actions. The net impact to the year for BSS was a reduction in operating earnings of approximately $146 million. Progress has been made in implementing process improvements and program management best practices, however, factory problems that arise out of acceptance testing continue to impact existing contracts. As a result, completion schedules have slipped which has resulted in exposing the Company to the risk of contract Termination for Default (TFD) notification. During the fourth quarter of 2002, the Company received a TFD notification on a commercial satellite contract that had an expected delivery beyond the contractual TFD date. The customer no longer required the satellite for their current business base. The Company is currently marketing the satellite, which was adjusted to the estimated net realizable value. Early in the first quarter of 2003, the Company passed the TFD dates for two commercial satellite contracts. Management believes a TFD situation for each of these contracts is not likely to result in a material financial impact due to continuing legal, production, and contractual efforts in work. Certain launch and satellite contracts include provisions for replacement launch services or hardware if specified performance criteria are not met. The Company has historically purchased insurance to cover these obligations when allowed under the terms of the contract. Due to recent events, the current insurance market reflects unusually high premium rates and also suffers from a lack of capacity to handle all insurance requirements. Although the Company does not intend to do so, it may elect to forego the procurement of third-party insurance and, instead, retain such risks internally. Management believes the contract cost estimates have sufficient provisions to cover the expected value for these risks. Previously identified market-based risks associated with Delta III inventory is being mitigated by a combination of reusing inventory on other Delta programs, customer payments provided to reassign payloads to other launch vehicles, and the retention of existing customer deposits should those customers terminate their contract for Delta III launches. At this time the Delta III inventory is no longer considered a material financial risk. The Sea Launch venture, in which the Company is a 40% partner with RSC Energia (25%) of Russia, Kvaerner ASA (20%) of Norway, and KB Yuzhnoye/PO Yuzhmash (15%) of Ukraine, provides ocean-based launch services to commercial satellite customers. The venture had one successful launch in 2002. The Company’s investment in this venture as of December 31, 2002, is reported at zero, which reflects the recognition of losses reported by Sea Launch in prior years. The venture incurred losses in 2002, due to the relatively low volume of launches, reflecting a depressed satellite market. The Company has financial exposure with respect to the venture, which relates to guarantees by the Company provided to certain Sea Launch creditors, performance guarantees provided by the Company to a Sea Launch customer of $33 million and financial exposure related to accounts receivable/inventory of $253 million. The exposures related to guarantees are included in the Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements discussion and disclosed in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company and Lockheed Martin are 50-50 partners in United Space Alliance, which is responsible for all ground processing of the Space Shuttle fleet and for space-related operations with the U.S. Air Force. United Space Alliance also performs modifications, testing and checkout operations that are required to ready the Space Shuttle for launch. United Space Alliance operations are performed under cost-plus-type contracts. The Company’s proportionate share of joint venture earnings is recognized as income. The segment’s operating earnings include earnings of $68 million, $72 million, and $60 million for 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, attributable to United Space Alliance. On February 1, 2003, the country experienced the tragic loss of Space Shuttle Columbia and its seven-person crew. The Company is assisting NASA to determine the cause of this accident. This accident did not impact the Company’s results of operations for 2002, and it is too early to determine the effect on the Company’s business operations for 2003 and beyond. Research and Development Within the Space and Communications businesses the Company continued investing in the new Delta IV expendable launch vehicle which resulted in its successful inaugural commercial launch in November of 2002. This product gives the Company greater access to a portion of the launch market that was previously unavailable with the Delta II rocket alone. - 35 - In the communications market, the Company is investing to enable connectivity between existing air/ground platforms, increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and leverage innovative communications concepts. Investments were made in Global Situational Awareness concepts to develop communication system architectures to support various business opportunities including Future Combat Systems, Joint Tactical Radio System, FAB-T and Global Missile Defense. A major contributor to the Company’s support of these DoD transformation programs is the investment in the Boeing Integration Center where the Company’s Network Centric Operations concepts are developed in partnership with its customers. The Company also will continue to make focused investments that will lead to the development of next-generation space intelligence systems. Space and Communications research and development expense, excluding in-process research and development, was $397 million in 2002 compared to $526 million in 2001 and 2000. Significant investment in development programs at the Space and Communications segment continued during 2002. Company-sponsored research and development expenditures supported the development of the Delta IV launch vehicle. Delta IV development expense has been reduced by the U.S. Government’s participation in developing the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV). AEW&C System research and development program expenses decreased as the effort transitioned to work that is specifically required for the Australian Wedgetail program. Company-sponsored research and development levels are expected to decline in 2003 due to the transition of the Delta IV launch vehicle into production. Backlog Total contractual backlog for Space and Communications was $14.9 billion at December 31, 2002 and $13.1 billion at December 31, 2001 and $13.7 billion at December 31, 2000. Space and Communications contractual backlog increased by 14% in 2002 compared to 2001. The 2002 increase is primarily due to orders for Proprietary Programs, an order by the Department of Transportation for Airport Security, a NASA award for space flight payload processing and orders for Delta IV launch vehicles. This increase was partially offset by the declines in commercial satellite backlog due to decreases in new orders and sales on existing orders. Business Environment and Trends Overview Space and Communications products and services, as part of Integrated Defense Systems, will span five distinctive markets: Integrated Battlespace, Missile Defense, Homeland Security, Human Space Flight and Exploration, and Commercial Launch and Satellite. Each of these markets has unique customers and requirements, and therefore, will be discussed individually below. Integrated Battlespace U.S. military force structure is shrinking, its platforms are aging, and the tempo of operations and engagements worldwide remains high. Several of the recent United States' military actions have demonstrated the value of systems solutions that allow all systems to communicate with each other; operate over longer ranges; and are unmanned and provide the advantages of precision, persistence and selective engagement. Refer to Military Aircraft and Missile Systems Business Environment and Trends beginning on page 33 for further discussion on Military Transformation. Missile Defense Funding for the missile defense market is primarily driven by the U.S. Government Missile Defense Agency (MDA) budget. The primary thrusts in this market are the continued development and deployment of theater missile defense systems and the Ground-based Missile Defense (GMD) program. The overall MDA missile defense budget is approximately $8 billion. There is continued Congressional support for development of strong missile defense capabilities as evidenced by the fact that the fiscal year 2003 budgets were fully funded in all four defense committees by Congress. In January 2002, a new GMD Program Strategy was released in which the MDA stated their objective to put a Test Bed capability in place by September 2004. This Test Bed would allow critical testing of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense segment along with the addition of other systems and sensors into the test scenario. These new requirements for a Test Bed and Development Program were baselined by the Company and the U.S. Government in 2002. The resulting contract change was finalized in December 2002. Additionally on December 17, 2002, President George W. Bush called for our nation’s missile defense capabilities to move from the test only category into a deployed system. The Company, in conjunction with MDA, has initiated efforts to fulfill the direction of the President. Through our leadership position on the Missile Defense National Team and our prime contractor role on the Ground-based Midcourse Defense segment program and on the Airborne Laser program, Space and Communications is positioned to maintain its role as MDA’s #1 contractor. - 36 - Homeland Security Since the events of September 11, 2001, the world has permanently changed. The President quickly issued an executive order establishing an Office of Homeland Security. This office was officially designated as a cabinet level department led by Governor Tom Ridge on January 24, 2003. This department will be responsible for a budget of nearly $40 billion annually with a workforce of 170,000 consolidating from 22 disparate agencies. Over the past year, the Company has aligned internally to meet the challenges of the new threat. In June 2002, the Company was chosen to lead the team that installed explosive detection technology for baggage screening in all U.S. airports by December 31, 2002. This was the largest Homeland Security contract awarded to date, representing one of the largest short-term projects in government history. The Company is focusing on the federal Homeland Security marketplace, and will leverage its experience and capabilities in network centric operations to enhance the solutions for Homeland Security opportunities. Human Space Flight and Exploration The total human space flight and exploration market is forecasted to be relatively flat over the next ten years. This forecast is based on budget projections for NASA, the primary customer in this market. But within this flat forecast the Company is observing changes in direction and emphasis with the establishment of a new vision and mission. Over the past year, NASA has developed a new Integrated Space Transportation Plan (ISTP) to implement their new vision. This plan is designed to benefit the International Space Station, Space Shuttle program, and the agency’s science and research objectives. The new ISTP dedicates more resources to the space station program, provides additional funding to extend the life and enhance the safety and reliability of the agency’s orbiter fleet, boosts funding for science-based payloads and research, and restructures NASA’s Space Launch Initiative. The Space Launch Initiative will now focus on the development of a crew transport vehicle to ferry space station crewmembers, along with a continued technology effort to identify future reusable launch vehicle technologies. The Company is well positioned to join with NASA to help realize their vision using the expertise the Company has gained from its prime contractor role on the Space Shuttle program and the International Space Station and an integral player in the Space Launch Initiative program. As NASA’s investigation of the Columbia accident continues the Company may see some budget reprioritizing, but it is far too early in the investigation to speculate on that. What we do know is that this administration is committed to finding the cause of the accident, fixing it, and successfully returning the Space Shuttle fleet back to operational status. We will participate fully in these efforts. Commercial Launch and Satellite The commercial market has softened significantly since the late 1990s in conjunction with the downturn in the telecommunications industry. These markets are now characterized by overcapacity, commodity pricing and limited near term opportunities. The recovery in the commercial satellite market may take several years at which time we believe the market will stabilize in the 15-20 satellites per year range. This recovery in satellite orders should also produce new opportunities in the launch services business. We have taken aggressive actions to right size and restructure our organizations to meet the future commercial demand, while continuing to meet our government customer requirements. In addition, we have worked diligently over the last year to improve processes in our quality, engineering and manufacturing disciplines. We believe Boeing Satellite Systems and Boeing Launch Services (Delta II, III, IV and Sea Launch) are positioned to bring unique and competitive offerings to our commercial customers as their requirements for new or replacement satellites resurfaces. Boeing Capital Corporation (Dollars in millions) 2002 2001 2000 Revenues $994 $815 $545 Operating Earnings $482 $562 $397 Operating Margins 48.5% 69.0% 72.8% Debt $9,465 $7,295 $4,318 Debt-to-Equity Ratio 5.7-to-1 5.3-to-1 6.4-to-1 Revenues Revenues for BCC consisted principally of income earned on portfolio assets (direct finance leases, operating leases, notes receivable and investments). The major revenue components include commercial aircraft and commercial equipment financing. Interest expense on debt is not included in BCC’s operating earnings as the Company reports interest expense below operating earnings on the consolidated statements of operations. However, interest expense of $410 million, $324 million, and $229 million was associated with debt relating to BCC financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. Beginning in 2003, interest expense will be reported as a component of operating earnings for BCC. - 37 - Operating revenues for BCC were $994 million in 2002, compared with $815 million in 2001 and $545 million in 2000. A larger portfolio, resulting from new business volume and portfolio transfers from Boeing over the last two years, is primarily responsible for the increased revenues in 2002 and 2001. Operating Earnings Operating earnings for BCC were $482 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, compared with $562 million for the year ended December 31, 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to the impairment and valuation allowance charges recognized in 2002, offset by additional income due to the growth in the portfolio. Operating earnings for 2001 were $562 million compared with $397 million in 2000. The growth in investment in financing assets was principally responsible for the increase. The increase was partially offset by higher provision for losses, and higher operating and other expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2002, the Company recognized a pre-tax expense of $426 million primarily in recognition of the deterioration of aircraft values and customer credit ratings. Total impairment expense recognized in 2001 and 2000 was not significant. BCCSegment OtherSegment Consolidated Increased valuation allowance $ 100 $ 80 $ 180 Impairment of investment in equipment trust certificates 13 66 79 Impairment of joint venture aircraft 48 48 Other assets impairments 39 80 119 $ 200 $ 226 $ 426 A pre-tax expense of $180 million was recorded to increase the valuation allowance based on the Company’s assessment of the adequacy of customer financing reserves. A specific pre-tax impairment of $79 million was recorded during the third quarter of 2002 related to a long-held investment in ETCs secured by aircraft on lease to United Airlines (“United”). The write-down was based on the decline in credit ratings of United, the long-term maturity of the investment and the decline in the underlying aircraft collateral valuations. The ultimate realization of this investment will depend upon legal developments in United’s bankruptcy proceedings and United’s ability to meet its related contractual obligations. A specific pre-tax impairment of $48 million was recorded related to a joint venture investment that was established to lease and eventually convert 24 727 passenger aircraft to full cargo configuration. Based on the Company’s assessment of current market conditions and the average age of the aircraft (averaging over twenty years old), the Company recorded an impairment for its share of the adjustment to estimated fair market value for the joint venture’s 727 aircraft. The BCC portfolio does not include any 727 aircraft other than those held through this joint venture. Other pre-tax charges of $119 million related to valuations of other assets in the portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2002. Included in this amount was a $66 million impairment charge recorded during the fourth quarter of 2002 on the return of 24 717s to the Company by AMR Corporation. The total BCC portfolio was $11.8 billion as of December 31, 2002, compared with $9.2 billion as of December 31, 2001. At December 31, 2002, BCC’s debt-to-equity ratio was 5.7-to-1, compared with 5.3-to-1 at December 31, 2001. Business Environment and Trends BCC acts as a captive finance subsidiary for the Company and provides market-based lease and loan financing primarily to airlines that purchase or lease commercial aircraft manufactured by the Company or others. BCC competes for aircraft finance business with other finance companies, commercial banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions. BCC also competes in the commercial equipment leasing and finance markets, primarily in the United States, against a number of large ticket competitors, mainly heavily capitalized leasing companies and relationship banks. Approximately 22% of BCC’s portfolio has been generated from commercial equipment leasing and financing activities. Commercial equipment consists of executive aircraft, machine tools and production equipment, containers and marine equipment, chemical, oil and gas equipment and other equipment. New business volume of BCC is funded with debt obtained in the capital markets, cash from operations, and contributions from the Company. - 38 - Published sources and recent market transactions indicate that values for various aircraft types used as collateral in BCC’s portfolio remained depressed. At the same time, the credit ratings of many airlines, particularly in the United States, have continued to deteriorate. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is concentrated among commercial airline customers. Certain customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or requested lease or loan restructurings; these negotiations were in various stages as of December 31, 2002. These bankruptcies or restructurings could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s earnings, cash flows or financial position. United filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 9, 2002. As of the filing date, the Company has not reached agreement with United on a restructuring of its various transactions. Future negotiations may result in changes to the agreements under which United has agreed to perform. So long as United remains in bankruptcy, United has the right to reject or abandon its transaction with the Company. In the event that future negotiations or proceedings result in the return of a substantial number of aircraft, there could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s earnings, cash flows or financial position at least until such time as the aircraft are sold or redeployed for adequate consideration. As of December 31, 2002, there were $311 million of assets, principally commercial aircraft that were held for sale or re-lease at BCC, of which $308 million were not yet identified with a firm contract to sell or place on lease. Additionally, approximately $207 million of BCC’s assets are currently scheduled to come off lease in 2003. The inability of BCC to sell such assets or place such assets into revenue-generating service could pose a potential risk to results of operations should some of these assets be deemed to be impaired. Airlines regularly utilize a special purpose entity (SPE) known as a Pass Through Trust. The Pass Through Trust enables the airline to aggregate a large number of aircraft secured notes into one trust vehicle, facilitating the issuance of larger bonds called Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). The most common form of PTCs issued by airlines is the EETCs. EETCs provide investors with tranched rights to cash flows from a financial instrument, as well as a collateral position in the related asset. While the underlying classes of equipment notes vary by maturity and/or coupon depending upon tenor or level of subordination of the specific equipment notes and their corresponding claim on the aircraft, the basic function of the Pass Through Trust in an EETC remains: to passively hold separate debt investments to enhance liquidity for investors, whom in turn pass this liquidity benefit directly to the airline in the form of lower coupon and/or greater debt capacity. BCC participates in several EETCs as an investor. The EETC investments are related to customers the Company believes have less than investment-grade credit. BCC also utilizes certain SPEs to isolate individual transactions for legal liability, perfect security interest from the perspective of the Company and a third-party lender in certain leveraged transactions, and realize certain income and sales tax benefits. These SPEs are fully consolidated in the Company’s financial statements. In December 2002, BCC completed an asset securitization that raised $299 million of secured debt through the use of a bank-sponsored Commercial Paper Conduit (C/P Conduit). As collateral for the debt, BCC transferred $331 million of assets from its portfolio to the C/P Conduit. These portfolio assets consisted of the cash flows associated with specific financing leases, notes and other receivables and operating leases. BCC also assigned to the C/P Conduit perfected security interests in $278 million of collateral underlying the transferred portfolio assets. The collateral pledged indirectly provides the C/P Conduit with additional protection in the event that the cash flows from the leases and notes are insufficient to cover the total debt outstanding under the transaction. The secured debt and securitized assets remain on BCC’s balance sheet. Other Other segment earnings were $(424) million in 2002, $(354) million in 2001, and $43 million in 2000. As of December 31, 2002 and 2001, operating earnings of $44 million and $23 million were attributable to four C-17 transport aircraft on lease to the United Kingdom Royal Air Force. These leases began in 2001. Offsetting the operating earnings of the C-17 leases were increases in losses during both 2002 and 2001 primarily due to increases in intercompany guarantees and asset impairments, lease accounting differences and other subsidies related to BCC. See Note 24. Research and development expense attributable to the Other segment was $129 million in 2002, $294 million in 2001, and $84 million in 2000. Research and development activities in the Other segment relate primarily to Connexion by BoeingSM and, to a lesser extent, Air Traffic Management. Astro Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, operates as a captive insurance company. This subsidiary enables the Company’s exposures to be insured at the lowest possible cost to the Company regardless of whether the market is overpriced. In addition, it provides flexibility to the Company in handling its changing risk financing needs and provides access to the reinsurance markets. Currently, Astro Ltd. insures aviation liability, workers compensation, general liability, property, as well as various smaller risk liability insurances. - 39 - Events of September 11, 2001 On September 11, 2001, the United States was the target of severe terrorist attacks that involved the use of U.S. commercial aircraft manufactured by the Company. These attacks resulted in a significant loss of life and property and caused major disruptions in business activities and in the U.S. economy overall. See Note 3. Employees and Labor Relations As of December 31, 2002, the Company’s principal collective bargaining agreements were with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) representing 20% of employees (current agreements expiring in May 2004, and September and October 2005); the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA) representing 13% of employees (current agreements expiring February 2004 and December 2005); and the United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) representing 4% of employees (current agreements expiring May 2003, April 2004, and September 2005). The Company’s workforce level was 166,000 at December 31, 2002. Contingent Items Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts and other matters are pending against the Company. Most significant legal proceedings are related to matters covered by insurance. Major contingencies are discussed below. The Company is subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. Due in part to their complexity and pervasiveness, such requirements have resulted in the Company being involved with related legal proceedings, claims and remediation obligations since the 1980s. The Company routinely assesses, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, its contingencies, obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a settlement and of recoveries from insurance carriers. The Company’s policy is to immediately accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites based on estimates of investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred. The costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connection with such activities have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact to the Company’s financial position. With respect to results of operations, related charges have averaged less than 2% of annual net earnings. Such accruals as of December 31, 2002, without consideration for the related contingent recoveries from insurance carriers, are less than 2% of total liabilities. Because of the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified contaminated sites and circumstances, the potential exists for environmental remediation costs to be materially different from the estimated costs accrued for identified contaminated sites. However, based on all known facts and expert analyses, the Company believes it is not reasonably likely that identified environmental contingencies will result in additional costs that would have a material adverse impact to the Company’s financial position or operating results and cash flow trends. The Company is subject to U.S. Government investigations from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result. Such proceedings could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. The Company believes, based upon all available information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position or continuing operations. In 1991, the U.S. Navy notified McDonnell Douglas (now a subsidiary of the Company) and General Dynamics Corporation (the “Team”) that it was terminating for default the Team’s contract for development and initial production of the A-12 aircraft. The Team filed a legal action to contest the Navy’s default termination, to assert its rights to convert the termination to one for “the convenience of the Government,” and to obtain payment for work done and costs incurred on the A-12 contract but not paid to date. As of December 31, 2002, inventories included approximately $583 million of recorded costs on the A-12 contract, against which the Company has established a loss provision of $350 million. The amount of the provision, which was established in 1990, was based on McDonnell Douglas’s belief, supported by an opinion of outside counsel, that the termination for default would be converted to a termination for convenience, and that the best estimate of possible loss on termination for convenience was $350 million. - 40 - On August 31, 2001, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision after trial upholding the U.S. Government’s default termination of the A-12 contract on the grounds that the Team could not meet the revised contract schedule unilaterally imposed by the U.S. Government. This followed an earlier trial court decision in favor of the contractors and reversal of that initial decision on appeal. The Team appealed that decision to the Court of Appeals and is awaiting a decision. The Team also obtained a stay of the trial court’s judgment to prevent the Navy from collecting any amounts prior to the decision by the Court of Appeals. If, after all judicial proceedings have ended, the courts determine that a termination for default was appropriate, the Company would incur an additional loss of approximately $275 million, consisting principally of remaining inventory costs and adjustments, and would be required to pay the U.S. Government one-half of the unliquidated progress payments of $1,350 million plus statutory interest from February 1991 (currently totaling approximately $1,040 million). The loss to the Company would total approximately $1,465 million in pre-tax charges. Although the Court of Federal Claims sustained the default termination in 2001, the Company believes that the court’s ruling is contrary to law and fact and that the loss provision established by McDonnell Douglas in 1990 continues to provide adequately for the reasonably possible reduction in value of A-12 net contracts in process as of December 31, 2002. Final resolution of the A-12 litigation will depend upon the outcome of further proceedings or possible negotiations with the U.S. Government. The Company is a defendant in seven employment discrimination matters in which class certification is sought or has been granted. These matters are pending in Seattle, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Tulsa, and Wichita. The Company intends to continue its aggressive defense of these cases. It is not possible to predict what impact, if any, these cases could have on the financial statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk Interest rate risk The Company has financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally short-term investments, fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Historically, the Company has not experienced material gains or losses due to interest rate changes. Additionally, the Company uses interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Based on the current holdings of short-term investments, as well as related swaps, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material for these instruments. Fixed-rate debt obligations issued by the Company are generally not puttable until maturity and are not actively traded by the Company in the market. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for the Company’s fixed-rate debt. Boeing Capital Corporation’s assets and liabilities, both fixed-rate and floating-rate, may be subject to interest rate risk to the extent that the maturities and repricing characteristics of the liabilities do not perfectly match those of the assets. The types and terms of borrowing and hedging instruments that are available to BCC in the market and possible changes in asset terms limit BCC’s ability to match assets and liabilities. BCC attempts to keep this mismatch risk small, partly through the use of interest rate swaps, and does not believe it is materially exposed to gains or losses due to interest rate changes. BCC has used public market information and common valuation methods to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities. The estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts BCC could realize in a current market exchange, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methods could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. - 41 - At December 31, 2002, the book values of BCC’s assets and liabilities were approximately $13 billion and $11 billion, respectively. BCC uses duration gap analysis to estimate the impact of changes in interest rates. Potential changes in twelve-month net interest income and in the current discounted value of the assets and liabilities are calculated based on the amount and timing of cash flows projected from each. At December 31, 2002, the Company estimated that if market interest rates for all maturities were affected by an immediate, one-time, 100-basis-point increase, BCC’s net earnings, taking into account increases in both revenue and interest expense, would have increased by an amount that is immaterial to the results of operations. Additionally, although the assets and liabilities impacted by a change in interest rates are generally not traded, BCC estimated that the net present value of these assets and liabilities would have changed by an amount that is immaterial to its financial position. Foreign currency exchange rate risk The Company is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. The Company uses foreign currency forward contracts and options from time to time to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to its ongoing business and operational financing activities. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2002, a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in the Company’s portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized loss of $30 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. Commodity price risk The Company is subject to commodity price risk relating principally to energy used in production. The Company periodically uses commodity derivatives, such as fixed-price purchase commitments, to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes of commodities. Commodity price exposure related to unhedged contracts is not material. - 42 -",2023-12-30 18:22:58.974627

BDS earnings decreased by $90 million due to lower earnings in the N&SS segment, partially offset by higher earnings in the GS&S and BMA segments. Other segment losses increased by $225 million primarily due to a reduction in the allowance for losses on receivables in 2011. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2012 reduced earnings by $403 million compared with 2011 primarily due to higher pension costs.Operating earnings in 2011 increased by $873 million compared with 2010. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $489 million, primarily due to higher revenues and a reduction in research and development costs, partially offset by increases in period costs associated with business growth. BDS earnings increased by $283 million compared with 2010 due to higher earnings in the BMA and GS&S segments, partially offset by lower earnings in the N&SS segment. Other segment earnings increased by $393 million primarily due to a $241 million reduction in the allowance for losses on receivables during 2011. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2011 reduced earnings by $253 million compared with 2010 primarily due to higher pension and postretirement costs.20Table of contentsThe following table summarizes our research and development expense:Years ended December 31,2012 2011 2010Commercial Airplanes$2,049 $2,715 $2,975Defense, Space & Security1,189 1,138 1,136Other60 65 10Total$3,298 $3,918 $4,121Our Research and development expense decreased by $620 million and $203 million in 2012 and 2011. These decreases were primarily due to lower spending at BCA on the 747-8 and 787-8 programs.The most significant items included in Unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2012 2011 2010Share-based plans($81) ($83) ($136)Deferred compensation(75) (61) (112)Pension(787) (269) 54Postretirement(112) (248) (59)Eliminations and other(336) (327) (482)Total($1,391) ($988) ($735)Share-based plans expense decreased by $53 million in 2011 primarily due to the expiration of the ShareValue trust at June 30, 2010.Deferred compensation expense increased by $14 million in 2012 and decreased by $51 million in 2011. The year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions.Eliminations and other unallocated items expense increased by $9 million in 2012 and decreased by $155 million in 2011. The fluctuations in 2012 and 2011 were due to the timing of intercompany expense allocations and elimination of profit on intercompany items. The 2012 expense includes a $121 million benefit related to a favorable court judgment on satellite litigation and the 2010 expense includes a $55 million charitable contribution.Unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of $3,383 million, $3,127 million and $1,864 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The increase in net periodic benefit costs related to pensions and other postretirement benefits is primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service costs driven by lower discount rates. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period. A portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense. The unallocated expense in 2011 includes $161 million of additional expense recorded during the third quarter due to an adjustment primarily related to prior years’ accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. See the discussion of the postretirement liabilities in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Earnings from operations included the following amounts allocated to business segments and Other unallocated items and eliminations.21Table of contents(Dollars in millions)Pension Other PostretirementBenefitsYears ended December 31,2012 2011 2010 2012 2011 2010Allocated to business segments($1,620) ($1,379) ($1,155) ($431) ($444) ($421)Other unallocated items and eliminations(787) (269) 54 (112) (248) (59)Total($2,407) ($1,648) ($1,101) ($543) ($692) ($480)Other Earnings Items(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2012 2011 2010Earnings from operations$6,311 $5,844 $4,971Other income, net62 47 52Interest and debt expense(463) (498) (516)Earnings before income taxes5,910 5,393 4,507Income tax expense(2,007) (1,382) (1,196)Net earnings from continuing operations$3,903 $4,011 $3,311Interest and debt expense decreased by $35 million in 2012 and $18 million in 2011 as a result of lower weighted average interest rates and debt balances.Our effective income tax rates were 34.0%, 25.6% and 26.5% for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Our 2012 effective tax rate was higher than prior years, primarily due to tax benefits of $397 million and $371 million recorded in 2011 and 2010 as a result of federal income tax audit settlements. Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2007. The absence of research and development tax credits also contributed to the higher tax rate in 2012. Our 2011 effective tax rate was lower than 2010, primarily due to an income tax charge of $150 million recorded during the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010.The research and development credit expired on December 31, 2011. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 that retroactively renews the research and development credit for 2012 and extends the credit through December 31, 2013. As tax law changes are recognized in the period in which new legislation is enacted, the 2012 R&D credit of approximately $150 million will be reflected as a discrete item in our income tax rate for the first quarter of 2013. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.22Table of contentsBacklogOur backlog at December 31 was as follows:(Dollars in millions)2012 2011 2010Contractual Backlog: Commercial Airplanes$317,287 $293,303 $255,591Defense, Space & Security: Boeing Military Aircraft29,674 24,085 25,094Network and Space Systems9,692 9,024 9,567Global Services and Support15,702 13,245 13,703Total Defense, Space & Security55,068 46,354 48,364Total contractual backlog$372,355 $339,657 $303,955Unobligated backlog$17,873 $15,775 $16,871Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2012 was due to commercial aircraft orders in excess of deliveries, partially reduced by cancellations of commercial airplane orders and changes in projected revenue escalation. The increase in contractual backlog during 2011 was due to commercial airplane orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation for undelivered commercial airplanes.Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The increase in unobligated backlog during 2012 is due to increases at BDS of $2,720 million compared with 2011 primarily due to F-15 orders and the contract award for the Space Launch System program received in 2012. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2011 is due to decreases at BDS of $3,135 million compared with 2010 primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts and termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the Brigade Combat Team Modernization (BCTM) program, partially offset by the U.S. Air Force (USAF) contract for the KC-46A Tanker and the Missile Defense Agency Development and Sustainment Contract.Additional ConsiderationsKC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the USAF to design, develop, manufacture and deliver 4 next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker will be a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This contract is a fixed-price incentive firm contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs. Changes to our estimated cost to perform the work could result in a material charge. This contract contains production options. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. For segment reporting purposes, backlog, revenues and costs are recorded in the Commercial Airplanes and BMA segments.Collective Bargaining Agreement Our collective bargaining agreement with The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace (SPEEA), which covers 23,600 employees, expired in October, 2012. SPEEA-represented employees continue to work under the terms of that contract. The parties continue contract negotiations and on January 17, 2013, Boeing presented a contract offer to SPEEA.23Table of contentsSegment Results of Operations and Financial ConditionCommercial AirplanesBusiness Environment and TrendsAirline Industry Environment Global economic growth and global trade, which are the primary drivers of air travel and air cargo growth, remained weak in 2012. Despite this, passenger traffic grew by approximately 6% in 2011 and 2012 and is forecast to continue at or near the long-term trend of 5% in 2013. There continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models, with airlines operating in emerging economies and low-cost-carriers leading growth. Estimates indicate a modest decline in air cargo traffic in 2012 with continued softness in 2013. The relative weakness of the air cargo market has impacted near-term demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions, and we continue to monitor the impact of this trend on our business.Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more fuel efficient airplanes and by employing efficiency generating service offerings in a high-fuel-price environment. Net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to total $7 billion in 2012 and the forecast shows some improvement in 2013. These profit levels reflect low profit margins for the industry, and risk remains due to ongoing economic and political uncertainty.The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger and cargo traffic, based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $4.5 trillion market for 34,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years.The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, and increased global environmental regulations.Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has enabled low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines have increased the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 15% of Commercial Airplanes’ contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines, including cargo carriers.We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above 90 seats. Many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment 24Table of contentshas resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors’ revenues and profits. Competitors routinely respond to a relatively weaker U.S. dollar by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. If the U.S. dollar strengthens, competitors can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings.We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively.Operating Results(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2012 2011 2010Revenues$49,127 $36,171 $31,834% of total company revenues60% 53% 50%Earnings/(loss) from operations$4,711 $3,495 $3,006Operating margins9.6% 9.7% 9.4%Research and development$2,049 $2,715 $2,975Contractual backlog$317,287 $293,303 $255,591Unobligated backlog$1,466 $2,088 $49RevenuesYear-over-year changes in Revenue are shown in the following table:(Dollars in millions)2012vs. 2011 2011vs. 2010New airplane sales$13,185 $3,766Commercial aviation services(161) 594Other(68) (23)Total$12,956 $4,337Revenues for 2012 increased by $12,956 million or 36% compared with 2011 primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries across all programs.Revenues for 2011 increased by $4,337 million or 13.6% compared with 2010 due to higher new airplane deliveries, including the impact of entry into service of the 787-8 and 747-8 Freighter, favorable commercial airplane delivery model mix and higher commercial aviation services revenues. The increase in revenues from commercial aviation services was primarily due to increased sales of spares.25Table of contentsCommercial airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: 737 747 767 777 787 Total2012 Cumulative deliveries4,293 1,458 1,040 1,066 49 Deliveries415(1) 31 26 83 46(2) 6012011 Cumulative deliveries3,878 1,427 1,014 983 3 Deliveries372(1) 9 20 73 3 4772010 Cumulative deliveries3,506 1,418 994 910 Deliveries376(1) 12 74 462(1) Includes intercompany deliveries of nine aircraft in 2012, seven in 2011 and five in 2010.(2) Includes three aircraft accounted for as revenues by BCA and as operating leases in consolidation.Earnings From OperationsEarnings from operations for 2012 increased by $1,216 million compared with 2011. This was primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries, which drove an increase in earnings of $1,292 million, and lower research and development expense of $666 million primarily due to lower spending on the 747-8 and 787-8 programs. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings of $742 million driven by higher fleet support costs, increased operating costs associated with business growth, other period costs and decreased earnings from commercial aviation services. The decrease in operating margins from 9.7% in 2011 to 9.6% in 2012 was primarily due to the dilutive effect of the 787 and 747-8 deliveries.Earnings from operations for 2011 increased by $489 million compared with 2010. This increase reflects earnings of $376 million from higher revenues on new airplane deliveries, $180 million of higher earnings due to commercial aviation services volume and margins and $261 million of lower research and development expense, partially offset by increases of $328 million reflecting higher fleet support costs and other costs associated with business growth.Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers.The increase in contractual backlog during 2012 was due to orders in excess of deliveries, partially reduced by cancellations of orders and changes in projected revenue escalation. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2012 was due to incremental funding of the existing multi-year contract for Commercial Airplanes’ share of the USAF contract for the KC-46A Tanker.The increase in contractual backlog during 2011 was due to orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation, partially reduced by cancellations of orders. The increase in unobligated backlog in 2011 represents Commercial Airplanes’ share of the USAF contract for the KC-46A Tanker.26Table of contentsAccounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders.Program737 747 767 777 7872012 Program accounting quantities6,600 1,574 1,103 1,450 1,100Undelivered units under firm orders3,074 67 68 365 799Cumulative firm orders7,367 1,525 1,108 1,431 8482011 Program accounting quantities6,200 1,549 1,084 1,350 1,100Undelivered units under firm orders2,365 97 72 380 857Cumulative firm orders6,243 1,524 1,086 1,363 8602010 Program accounting quantities5,000 1,524 1,048 1,150 *Undelivered units under firm orders2,186 107 50 253 847Cumulative firm orders5,692 1,525 1,044 1,163 847*The initial accounting quantity for the 787 program was established in the third quarter of 2011.737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 400 units during 2012 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. As planned, production increased from 31.5 to 35 airplanes per month during 2012. We continue to expect to increase production from 35 to 38 airplanes per month beginning in 2013 and a further increase to 42 airplanes per month beginning in 2014. The majority of the 737 orders during 2012 related to the 737 MAX, the new engine variant of the 737. The accounting quantity for the 737 program includes NG and MAX units. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017.747 Program The accounting quantity for the 747 program increased by 25 units in 2012, reflecting the normal process of estimating planned production under existing and anticipated contracts. We continue to incorporate changes identified during flight testing into previously completed airplanes. First delivery of the 747-8 Intercontinental occurred in February 2012.The production rate increased from 1.5 to 2 airplanes per month in May 2012. Ongoing weakness in the air cargo market and lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger aircraft have resulted in pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated in 2012. We have a number of unsold Freighter and Intercontinental production positions beyond 2013. If we are unable to obtain orders for multiple Freighter aircraft in 2013 consistent with our near-term production plans, we may be required to take actions including 27Table of contentsreducing the number of airplanes produced and/or building airplanes for which we have not received firm orders. We also remain focused on reducing out-of-sequence work, improving supply chain efficiency and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If market and production risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face an additional reach-forward loss that may be material.767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 19 units during 2012 reflecting the normal process of estimating planned production under existing and anticipated contracts. As we reconfigure the 767 assembly line to include the USAF KC-46A Tanker, we plan to decrease our production rate from 2 to 1 airplanes per month in late 2013. We then expect to increase the rate to 1.5 per month in 2014 and back to 2 per month in 2016.777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 100 units during 2012 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. As previously announced, we plan to increase our production rate from 7 per month to 8.3 per month in 2013.787 Program We delivered 46 787 aircraft in 2012 bringing cumulative deliveries to 49. We continued to incorporate engineering and other design changes identified during flight testing into already completed aircraft. Beginning in June 2012, airplanes coming out of final assembly have not required change incorporation at our Everett modification center. During the second quarter of 2012 we achieved a production rate of 3.5 per month in final assembly and in the fourth quarter of 2012, we achieved a program production rate of 5 airplanes per month in final assembly. We also activated the temporary surge line in Everett in the third quarter. We remain focused on achieving further planned increases in 787 production rates while continuing to satisfy customer mission and performance requirements. We also continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly, including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, as well as introduction of the 787-9 derivative into the manufacturing process. We continue to expect to increase the production rate of 787 aircraft to 10 per month in final assembly by the end of 2013 with first deliveries occurring at that rate in early 2014. Our efforts to achieve planned production rate targets include improving the production system, coordinating rate increases with suppliers and increasing production rates in both Everett and North Charleston final assembly. We continue to expect first delivery of the 787-9 to occur in early 2014. In addition, we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of prior schedule changes, including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions.During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense. During the fourth quarter of 2012 we finalized an order for one of the three remaining flight test aircraft. We continue to believe that the other two 787 flight-test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to those airplanes in program inventory at December 31, 2012. If we determine that either of the remaining aircraft cannot be sold, we may incur additional charges.The accounting quantity of 1,100 units remains unchanged and represents approximately 10 years of production at planned production rates. The cumulative impacts of production challenges, change incorporation, schedule delays from prior periods and customer and supplier impacts have created significant pressure on program profitability. If risks related to this program, including risks associated with change incorporation, planned production rate increases, or introducing the 787-9 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, as well as further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks.A battery-related failure occurred on a 787 aircraft on January 7, 2013. On January 15, 2013 a second 787 aircraft had a battery incident. On January 16, 2013, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an 28Table of contentsairworthiness directive to address potential battery risk on the 787 and required U.S. aircraft operators to suspend operations of all 787 aircraft. International government regulators also issued directives to the same effect. We are working with the government regulators and 787 aircraft operators to investigate both incidents. While production continues on the 787, we have suspended deliveries until appropriate clearance is granted by the regulatory agencies. We are unable to reasonably estimate a loss or a range of loss at this time because such estimates are dependent on the ultimate finding as to cause and the timing and conditions surrounding a resolution and return to flight. Any such resolution could have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services.Research and Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.Our Research and development expense decreased by $666 million and $260 million in 2012 and 2011. These decreases were primarily due to lower spending on the 747-8 and 787-8 programs.Additional ConsiderationsThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft derivatives, such as the 787-9 and 737 MAX, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors in aircraft purchase contracts, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.29Table of contentsDefense, Space & SecurityBusiness Environment and TrendsU.S. Defense Environment Overview In August 2011, the Budget Control Act reduced the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) top line budget by approximately $490 billion through 2021. In addition, U.S. government expenditures are subject to the potential for further reductions, generally referred to as “sequestration”. Sequestration would result in additional reductions of approximately $500 billion from the defense top line budget through 2021. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has estimated that sequestration would reduce non-exempt defense discretionary accounts during U.S. government fiscal year 2013 by approximately 9.4% (excluding military personnel accounts). The OMB has further stated that the budget for Overseas Contingency Operations and any unobligated balances in prior year funds would be included in aggregate reductions but has otherwise indicated that it cannot yet assess the impact of sequestration at the program, project and activity level. The U.S. DoD has indicated that such reductions might require the termination of certain, as yet undetermined, procurement programs, and other U.S. government customers, such as NASA and various intelligence agencies, may be required to take comparable actions. Any such impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows. With the aforementioned fiscal challenges as a backdrop, the U.S. DoD announced a significant revision to the defense strategy in January 2012. This new strategy prioritized the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions, reduced the number of ground forces, maintained nuclear deterrence and reduced Cold War assets. Additionally, it emphasized the increasing importance of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Cyber Security; Space; Special Operations; and Unmanned Systems in implementing the nation's security posture. We anticipated this shift in U.S. DoD priorities and aligned our strategy accordingly. As such, we have been developing organic and inorganic capabilities to better serve our customers and their emerging needs in these markets, including the acquisition over the last five years of targeted capabilities with expertise in these priority markets.International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by rapidly evolving security challenges and the need for countries to modernize aging inventories. Western governments are pressured by new threats to security while at the same time dealing with constrained budgets. In Europe, the continuing financial challenges are forcing governments to institute austerity measures negatively impacting defense spending in the near term.The strongest opportunities for BDS growth in 2013 will be the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions where the relative financial strength of these economies, coupled with a broad spectrum of evolving threats, will result in procurement of defense and security systems.30Table of contentsBDS RealignmentEffective January 1, 2012, 2011 and 2010, certain programs were realigned among BDS segments. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment.Operating Results(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2012 2011 2010Revenues$32,607 $31,976 $31,943% of total company revenues40% 47% 50%Earnings from operations$3,068 $3,158 $2,875Operating margins9.4% 9.9% 9.0%Contractual backlog$55,068 $46,354 $48,364Unobligated backlog$16,407 $13,687 $16,822Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.RevenuesBDS revenues increased by $631 million in 2012 compared with 2011, due to higher revenues of $1,437 million in the BMA segment and $264 million in the GS&S segment, partially offset by lower revenues of $1,070 million in the N&SS segment. BDS revenues increased by $33 million in 2011 compared with 2010, due to higher revenues in the BMA and the GS&S segments, partially offset by lower revenues in the N&SS segment.Operating EarningsBDS operating earnings in 2012 decreased by $90 million compared with 2011 due to lower earnings of $201 million in the N&SS segment, partially offset by higher earnings of $56 million and $55 million in the GS&S and BMA segments. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $150 million higher in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily reflecting higher favorable adjustments in the BMA segment.BDS operating earnings in 2011 increased by $283 million compared with 2010 primarily due to higher earnings of $276 million and $33 million in the BMA and GS&S segments, partially offset by lower earnings of $26 million in the N&SS segment. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments which were $104 million higher in 2011 compared with 2010.31Table of contentsBacklogTotal backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog increased by 19% in 2012, from $60,041 million to $71,475 million, primarily due to F-15 and C-17 orders and the contract award for the Space Launch System program received in 2012. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below.Additional ConsiderationsOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Proprietary and Space Launch Systems programs.Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C), Family of Advanced Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T), India P-8I, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, and commercial and military satellites.Boeing Military AircraftOperating Results(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2012 2011 2010Revenues$16,384 $14,947 $14,238% of total company revenues20% 22% 22%Earnings from operations$1,581 $1,526 $1,250Operating margins9.6% 10.2% 8.8%Contractual backlog$29,674 $24,085 $25,094Unobligated backlog$9,286 $7,155 $8,297RevenuesBMA revenues increased by 10% in 2012 compared with 2011. The increase of $1,437 million in 2012 was primarily due to higher deliveries on the P-8A and Apache programs of $1,050 million and higher milestone revenue of $426 million on the KC-46A Tanker program. In addition, F-15 program revenues were $450 million higher reflecting initial revenues on the contract for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia partially offset by lower F-15 deliveries. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $723 million related to fewer deliveries of C-17 aircraft in 2012 and the conclusion of the KC-767 International Tanker program in 2011.32Table of contentsBMA revenues increased by 5% in 2011 compared with 2010. The increase of $709 million in 2011 was primarily due to higher AEW&C, C-17 and KC-767 International Tanker revenues. AEW&C revenues increased by $780 million in 2011 due to delivery of the first two Peace Eye aircraft and higher Wedgetail milestone revenues. C-17 revenues increased by $273 million reflecting favorable mix, partially offset by fewer deliveries. International Tanker revenues increased by $235 million due to higher deliveries. In addition, initial revenues on the USAF KC-46A Tanker were recognized in 2011. Lower volumes on the F-22, F/A-18 and Apache programs combined to reduce revenues by $613 million. Boeing production deliveries on the F-22 program ended in 2011. There were no new-build Apache deliveries in 2011, however, new-build deliveries resumed in 2012.Deliveries of new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows:Years ended December 31,2012 2011 2010F/A-18 Models48 49 50F-15E Eagle8 15 13C-17 Globemaster III10 13 14CH-47 Chinook51 32 20AH-64 Apache19 13AEW&C3 3 4P-8A Poseidon5 KC-767 International Tanker 3 1Total new-build production aircraft144 115 115Operating EarningsBMA operating earnings increased by $55 million in 2012 primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries on the P-8A and Apache programs and reach-forward loss provisions in 2011 on the KC-767 International Tanker program. These increases were partially offset by fewer aircraft deliveries on the C-17 program and higher research and development costs. The increase in earnings includes net favorable cumulative catch-up contract adjustments which were $139 million higher in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily reflecting favorable adjustments on the F-15 and Chinook programs.Operating earnings increased by $276 million in 2011 primarily due to $236 million of higher earnings on the AEW&C program reflecting the initial Peace Eye deliveries and lower reach-forward loss provisions in 2011 on the AEW&C Wedgetail and Peace Eagle contracts. Lower reach-forward losses of $49 million on the KC-767 International Tanker program and lower research and development costs also contributed to the earnings improvements.BacklogBMA total backlog in 2012 increased by 25% from 2011, primarily due to F-15 and C-17 orders. Total backlog in 2011 decreased by 6% from 2010, primarily due to 2011 deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years partially offset by BMA’s share of the USAF contract awards for the KC-46A and low-rate initial production of the P-8A.Additional ConsiderationsC-17See the discussion of the C-17 program in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.33Table of contentsNetwork & Space SystemsOperating Results(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2012 2011 2010Revenues$7,584 $8,654 $9,449% of total company revenues9% 13% 15%Earnings from operations$478 $679 $705Operating margins6.3% 7.8% 7.5%Contractual backlog$9,692 $9,024 $9,567Unobligated backlog$6,917 $6,424 $8,436RevenuesN&SS revenues decreased by 12% in 2012 and 8% in 2011. The decrease of $1,070 million in 2012 was primarily due to $835 million of lower revenues on the Brigade Combat Team Modernization (BCTM) program, which was terminated for convenience during 2011. In addition, customer funding constraints on the GMD program and conclusion of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 reduced revenues by a total of $251 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher Space & Intelligence Systems revenues of $178 million due to larger volume of deliveries in 2012.The decrease of $795 million in 2011 was primarily due to $577 million of lower revenues on the BCTM program, which was terminated for convenience during 2011. Lower revenues on the GMD, SBInet and Joint Tactical Radio System programs of $150 million, $146 million and $93 million, respectively, were more than offset by $150 million of higher sales of Delta inventory to United Launch Alliance (ULA) and $250 million of higher commercial and civil satellite revenues.Delta launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows:Years ended December 31,2012 2011 2010Delta II 1Delta IV 1Commercial and civil satellites3 1 3Military satellites7 3 1Operating EarningsN&SS earnings decreased by $201 million in 2012 primarily due to lower revenues on the BCTM program and a $42 million charge related to a contract restructure of an electronic and mission system program. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $56 million lower in 2012 than in 2011 primarily reflecting the $42 million charge described above. Operating earnings decreased by $26 million in 2011 primarily due to lower revenues and higher research and development costs.N&SS operating earnings include equity earnings of $180 million, $194 million and $189 million from the United Space Alliance (USA) joint venture and the ULA joint venture in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Operating earnings in 2012 include a $39 million gain related to the termination and settlement of USA’s defined benefit pension plans.34Table of contentsBacklogN&SS total backlog increased by 8% in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the contract award for the Space Launch System program, partially offset by current year deliveries and sales on contracts awarded in prior years. Total backlog decreased 14% in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the BCTM program and revenues recognized on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by the contract award for the Missile Defense Agency Development and Sustainment Contract.Additional ConsiderationsUnited Launch AllianceSee the discussion of ULA in Notes 7, 12, and 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Sea LaunchSee the discussion of the Sea Launch receivables in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.LightSquaredSee the discussion of the LightSquared receivables in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Global Services & SupportOperating Results(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2012 2011 2010Revenues$8,639 $8,375 $8,256% of total company revenues11% 12% 13%Earnings from operations$1,009 $953 $920Operating margins11.7% 11.4% 11.1%Contractual backlog$15,702 $13,245 $13,703Unobligated backlog$204 $108 $89RevenuesGS&S revenues increased by 3% in 2012 and by 1% in 2011. The 2012 increase of $264 million is primarily due to higher volume in several Integrated Logistics (IL) programs, including contracts to support Chinook and C-17 aircraft, and higher Training Systems & Government Services (TSGS) revenues primarily related to the P-8A program. The 2011 increase of $119 million is primarily due to higher revenues on several IL programs, partially offset by lower revenues from Maintenance, Modifications and Upgrades (MM&U) due to the conclusion in 2010 of our KC-10 support program.35Table of contentsOperating EarningsGS&S operating earnings increased by 6% in 2012 primarily due to improved performance on several MM&U programs and higher revenues on several IL programs. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $67 million higher in 2012 than in 2011.Operating earnings increased by 4% in 2011 primarily due to higher earnings on several IL programs, partially offset by lower earnings on MM&U programs.BacklogGS&S total backlog increased by 19% in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the award of F-15 support contracts. Total backlog decreased by 3% in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to revenues recognized on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years on several IL programs, partially offset by a TSGS contract award on the P-8A program.Boeing CapitalBusiness Environment and TrendsBCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2012 totaled $4,066 million. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is concentrated among certain U.S. commercial airline customers. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types most notably out-of-production Boeing aircraft such as 717 aircraft.BCC provided customer financing of $364 million and $239 million during 2012 and 2011. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2013, we expect financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources.Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,200 western-built commercial jet aircraft (10% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2012, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 25% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2011 and 2010, 9.4% and 10.5% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.Summary Financial Information(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2012 2011 2010Revenues$441 $520 $639Earnings from operations$82 $113 $152Operating margins19% 22% 24%RevenuesBCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes. BCC’s revenues decreased $79 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower operating and finance lease income. Operating lease income decreased as a result of the return of aircraft and lower lease rates on re-leased aircraft. In addition, lower finance lease income reflects the revised contractual terms of BCC’s leases with AirTran Airways Inc.(Airtran), a36Table of contents wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest), negotiated in conjunction with receiving a full guarantee from Southwest of those lease payment obligations in the fourth quarter of 2011.The decrease in revenues in 2011 compared with 2010 of $119 million was primarily due to lower operating lease income from a smaller portfolio of equipment under operating leases as a result of aircraft returns and lower lease rates on re-leased aircraft and lower interest income on notes receivable resulting from a lower weighted average notes receivable balance and a decrease in the weighted average annual effective interest rate during 2011.Earnings From OperationsBCC’s operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, recovery of losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings decreased by $31 million in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to lower revenues partially offset by lower interest and asset impairment expense.Operating earnings decreased by $39 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to lower revenues and higher asset impairment expense partially offset by lower interest expense, lower depreciation expense and a reduction in the allowance for losses.Financial PositionThe following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31:(Dollars in millions)2012 2011BCC customer financing and investment portfolio$4,066 $4,315Valuation allowance as a % of total receivables2.0% 2.3%Debt$2,511 $3,400Debt-to-equity ratio5.0-to-1 6.3-to-1BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2012 decreased from December 31, 2011 primarily due to normal portfolio run-off and asset sales, partially offset by the origination of notes receivable. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, BCC had $354 million and $521 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, of which $266 million and $476 million had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $78 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2013. These aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and approximately $33 million of such aircraft had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts as of December 31, 2012.For the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, AirTran accounted for 18% and 21% of BCC revenue. On July 8, 2012, BCC, Boeing, Southwest and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta) reached agreement whereby 78 BCC 717 aircraft on lease to AirTran will be subleased from AirTran to Delta on a phased-in basis beginning in 2013, with the sublease scheduled for the duration of the lease term between BCC and AirTran. Delta has committed to lease these 717 aircraft from BCC for an additional seven-year period following the expiration of the sublease.BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in the Other segment, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.37Table of contentsBankruptciesIn 2011, American Airlines, Inc. (American Airlines) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. American Airlines retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including the right to reject executory contracts, such as aircraft leases. American Airlines has not rejected any of the leases related to our aircraft. At December 31, 2012, American Airlines accounted for $524 million of our customer financing portfolio, of which $399 million represents collateral for $231 million of non-recourse debt. We believe that our customer financing receivables from American Airlines are sufficiently collateralized such that we do not expect to incur losses related to those receivables as a result of the bankruptcy. We continue to monitor the American Airlines bankruptcy for potential impacts on our business.Restructurings and Restructuring RequestsFrom time to time, certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. During 2012, BCC did not reach agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position.Other Segment(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2012 2011 2010Revenues$133 $150 $138Earnings/(Loss) from operations(159) 66 (327)Other segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2012 increased by $225 million compared with 2011 primarily due to a $241 million reduction in the allowance for losses on AirTran receivables in 2011. Lower environmental expense of $82 million in 2012 compared with 2011 was largely offset by higher costs related to BCC guarantees and increases in other costs.Other segment operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $393 million compared with 2010 primarily due to a $241 million reduction in the allowance for losses on AirTran receivables and $124 million of lower impairment charges related to our customer financing portfolio in 2011.38Table of contentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow Summary(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2012 2011 2010Net earnings$3,900 $4,018 $3,307Non-cash items2,728 2,140 2,679Changes in working capital880 (2,135) (3,034)Net cash provided by operating activities7,508 4,023 2,952Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities(3,757) 2,369 (4,831)Net cash used by financing activities(3,477) (1,700) (1,962)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents18 (2) (15)Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents292 4,690 (3,856)Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year10,049 5,359 9,215Cash and cash equivalents at end of period$10,341 $10,049 $5,359Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $7.5 billion during 2012, an increase of $3.5 billion compared with 2011 primarily due to lower inventory growth in 2012, which was partially offset by $1.6 billion of contributions to our pension plans in 2012 compared with $0.5 billion in 2011 and $35 million in 2010. Our investment in gross inventories increased by $6.2 billion in 2012, and by $9.8 billion in 2011, driven by higher investments in commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787 inventory. Advances and progress billings increased to $41.6 billion at December 31, 2012 compared with $39.8 billion at December 31, 2011 and $34.7 billion at December 31, 2010.Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities totaled $3.8 billion during 2012 compared with $2.4 billion provided during 2011, largely due to higher contributions to investments in time deposits. Net contributions to investments were $2 billion in 2012 compared with net proceeds from investments of $4 billion in 2011. In 2012, capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion, consistent with the prior year. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in 2013 due to continued investment to support growth.Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $3.5 billion during 2012, an increase of $1.8 billion compared with 2011 as a result of higher debt repayments of $1.1 billion and lower new borrowings of $0.7 billion.In 2012, we repaid $2.1 billion of debt, including repayments of $0.9 billion of debt held at BCC. At December 31, 2012 and 2011, the recorded balance of debt was $10.4 billion and $12.4 billion, of which $1.4 billion and $2.4 billion were classified as short-term. This includes $2.5 billion and $3.4 billion of debt recorded at BCC, of which $0.6 billion and $0.9 billion were classified as short-term.In 2012 and 2011, we had 1,007,706 and 350,778 shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholding and did not repurchase any shares through our open market share repurchase program. In December 2012, we announced the resumption of this program with repurchases expected to total between $1.5 and $2 billion in 2013.Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2012 and at December 31, 2012, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $4.6 39Table of contentsbillion of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs.Financing commitments totaled $18.1 billion and $15.9 billion as of December 31, 2012 and 2011. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required.In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities.At December 31, 2012 and 2011, our pension plans were $19.7 billion and $16.6 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an ERISA basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2012 with minimal required contributions in 2013. We expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $1.5 billion in 2013. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.As of December 31, 2012, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2012, and the estimated timing thereof.(Dollars in millions)Total Lessthan 1year 1-3years 3-5years After 5yearsLong-term debt (including current portion)$10,251 $1,340 $2,147 $1,095 $5,669Interest on debt(1)6,177 510 864 749 4,054Pension and other postretirement cash requirements25,558 579 1,244 7,025 16,710Capital lease obligations184 102 78 4 Operating lease obligations1,405 218 334 209 644Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position118,002 44,472 41,838 18,956 12,736Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position15,981 14,664 1,307 1 9Total contractual obligations$177,558 $61,885 $47,812 $28,039 $39,822(1) Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2012. Variable rate debt was less than 1% of our total debt at December 31, 2012.40Table of contentsPension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Approximately 5% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts.Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation.Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2012, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2012, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $16.2 billion that extend through 2026. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2012, our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $111 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. Our income tax matters are excluded from the table above. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.41Table of contentsCommercial CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2012.(Dollars in millions)Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year1-3years 4-5years After 5yearsStandby letters of credit and surety bonds$4,545 $2,791$1,332 $292 $130Commercial aircraft financing commitments18,083 1,3416,588 6,253 3,901Total commercial commitments$22,628 $4,132$7,920 $6,545 $4,031Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Contingent ObligationsWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our contesting the default termination of the contract for A-12 aircraft, certain employment, labor and benefits litigation and civil securities litigation relating to disclosures concerning the 787 program.Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $710 million at December 31, 2012. For additional information, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Income Taxes We have recorded a liability of $1,055 million at December 31, 2012 for uncertain tax positions.For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Critical Accounting PoliciesContract AccountingWe use contract accounting to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit for almost all of our BDS business. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. 42Table of contentsDue to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ending December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all BDS contracts increased operating earnings by $379 million, $229 million and $125 million, respectively.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2012 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $326 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.Program AccountingProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends.43Table of contentsTo ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2012 had been estimated to be lower by 1%, it would have increased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $420 million. If the combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2012 (excluding the 747 and 787 programs which have gross margins that are breakeven or near breakeven at December 31, 2012) had been estimated to be higher by 1%, it would have decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $324 million. If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if we are required to change one or more of our pricing, cost or other assumptions related to these programs, we could be required to record reach forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results.Aircraft ValuationAllowance for Losses on Customer Financing Receivables The allowance for losses on customer financing receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of customer financing receivables in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the customer financing receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly.Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings, collateral values and default rates. If each customer’s credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at December 31, 2012, the allowance would have decreased by $35 million or increased by $90 million. If the collateral values were 20% higher or lower at December 31, 2012, the allowance would have decreased by $21 million or increased by $20 million. If the cumulative default rates used for each rating category increased or decreased 1%, the allowance would have increased or decreased by $6 million.Impairment Review for Assets Under Operating Leases and Held for Re-Lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset.When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.44Table of contentsHad future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $26 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.Residual Values Equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease. If the estimated residual values declined 20% at December 31, 2012, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2012, and a future cumulative pre-tax earnings reduction of approximately $82 million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods, of which approximately $16 million would be recognized in 2013.Our investment in sales-type/finance leases includes future minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of leased assets less unearned income. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the decline occurs. If the estimated residual values declined 20% at December 31, 2012, we estimate that we would have reduced pre-tax income by $49 million for the year ended December 31, 2012.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible ImpairmentsGoodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. April 1 is our annual testing date. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2012 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill.As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had $497 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would reduce the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets by less than $1 million.45Table of contentsPostretirement PlansThe majority of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans. All nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. We also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligations and Shareholders’ equity.The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2012.(Dollars in millions)Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bpsPension plans Projected benefit obligation($2,444) $3,112Net periodic pension cost(250) 312Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation(175) 205Net periodic postretirement benefit cost(12) 13Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2012 net periodic pension expense by $126 million. We expect 2013 net periodic pension cost to increase by approximately $400 million and the portion recognized in earnings for 2013 to increase by approximately $800 million primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate from 4.4% at December 31, 2011 to 3.8% at December 31, 2012 and amortization of actuarial losses.The assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following year’s expense, recorded liabilities and Shareholders’ equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change as of December 31, 2012.(Dollars in millions)Change in medical trend rateIncrease 100 bps Change in medical trend rateDecrease 100 bpsOther postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation$827 ($700)Net periodic postretirement benefit cost128 (110)Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate RiskWe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2012, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our 46Table of contentspre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2012, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by $194 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by $221 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.47Table of contents",2023-12-30 18:23:49.188016

Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $3,854 million due to higher new airplane deliveries. BDS revenues increased by $590 million due to higher revenues in the Network & Space Systems (N&SS) and Global Services & Support (GS&S) segments offset by lower revenues in the Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) segment. The change in unallocated items and eliminations primarily reflects the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries. Revenues in 2012 increased by $12,963 million or 19% compared with 2011. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $12,956 million primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries across all programs. BDS revenues increased by $631 million due to higher revenues in the BMA and GS&S segments partially offset by lower revenues in the N&SS segment. Unallocated items and eliminations reduced revenues by $610 million in 2012 compared with $82 million in 2011 reflecting higher intercompany deliveries of P-8 and commercial aircraft in 2012.Earnings From OperationsThe following table summarizes Earnings from operations:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2013 2012 2011Commercial Airplanes$5,795 $4,711 $3,495Defense, Space & Security3,235 3,068 3,158Boeing Capital107 88 119Other segment(156) (186) 39Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense (1,314) (899) (517)Other unallocated items and eliminations(1,105) (492) (471)Earnings from operations (GAAP)$6,562 $6,290 $5,823Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense1,314 899 517Core operating earnings (Non-GAAP)$7,876 $7,189 $6,340Earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $272 million compared with 2012.

Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense in 2013 reduced earnings by $415 million compared with 2012 due to higher unallocated pension expense offset by lower unallocated other postretirement expense. Other unallocated items and eliminations in 2013 reduced earnings by $613 million primarily due to a charge 19Table of Contentsrecorded in 2013 related to the settlement of A-12 litigation described in Note 20 and higher 2013 deferred compensation expense.Earnings from operations in 2012 increased by $467 million compared with 2011. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $1,216 million reflecting higher new airplane deliveries and lower research and development expense partially offset by higher fleet support costs, increased operating costs associated with business growth, other period costs and decreased earnings from commercial aviation services. BDS earnings decreased by $90 million due to lower earnings in the N&SS segment, partially offset by higher earnings in the BMA and GS&S segments. Other segment losses increased by $225 million primarily due to a reduction in the allowance for losses on receivables in 2011. Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense in 2012 reduced earnings by $382 million compared with 2011 primarily due to higher pension expense.Core operating earnings in 2013 increased by $687 million compared with 2012 as higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes and BDS more than offset the A-12 charge and higher 2013 deferred compensation expense.Core operating earnings in 2012 increased by $849 million compared with 2011 primarily reflecting higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes offset by the impact of the reduction in the allowance for losses on receivables recorded in 2011.

Research and development expense in 2012 decreased by $620 million compared to 2011 primarily due to lower spending at Commercial Airplanes on the 747 and 787 programs.20Table of ContentsUnallocated Items and Eliminations The most significant items included in Unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2013 2012 2011Share-based plans($95) ($81) ($83)Deferred compensation(238) (75) (61)Eliminations and other(366) (457) (327)Litigation settlements(406) 121 Sub-total (included in core operating earnings*)(1,105) (492) (471)Pension(1,374) (787) (269)Postretirement60 (112) (248)Pension and other postretirement benefit expense (excluded from core operating earnings*)(1,314) (899) (517)Total($2,419) ($1,391) ($988)* Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See page 47.Deferred compensation expense increased by $163 million in 2013, primarily driven by increases in our stock price, and by $14 million in 2012, primarily driven by increases in the overall stock market performance.Eliminations and other unallocated expense decreased by $91 million in 2013, primarily due to the timing of elimination of profit on intercompany items, and increased by $130 million in 2012 due to the timing of intercompany expense allocations and elimination of profit on intercompany items.Litigation settlements include the 2013 charge of $406 million related to the settlement of the A-12 litigation described in Note 20 and the $121 million benefit recorded in 2012 due to a favorable court judgment on satellite litigation.We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pension and other postretirement benefits of $3,769 million, $3,383 million and $3,127 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The increase in net periodic benefit cost related to pension is primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service costs driven by lower discount rates. Unallocated pension expense in 2013 reflects the pension curtailment charge of $73 million related to the decision in September 2013 to end production of the C-17 aircraft in 2015. See Note 11. During the third quarter of 2013 we also determined that the pension expense in prior years was overstated and recorded a reduction in pension expense of $63 million. Unallocated other postretirement benefit expense in 2011 includes $161 million of additional expense due to an adjustment primarily related to prior years’ accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. See the discussion of the postretirement liabilities in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 21Table of ContentsA portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized as product costs in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods.

Our 2013 effective tax rate was lower due to research tax credits for the 2013 and 2012 tax years that were both recorded in 2013 and research and experimental regulations issued by the Internal Revenue Service in 2013 which resulted in $212 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits being recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013. Our 2011 effective tax rate was lower primarily due to tax benefits of $397 million recorded as a result of federal income tax audit settlements in addition to research tax credits which were not available in 2012. Federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2007. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.22Table of ContentsBacklogOur backlog at December 31 was as follows:(Dollars in millions)2013 2012 2011Contractual Backlog: Commercial Airplanes$372,980 $317,287 $293,303Defense, Space & Security: Boeing Military Aircraft24,825 29,226 23,629Network & Space Systems9,832 10,078 9,429Global Services & Support15,024 15,764 13,296Total Defense, Space & Security49,681 55,068 46,354Total contractual backlog$422,661 $372,355 $339,657Unobligated backlog$18,267 $17,873 $15,775Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2013 and 2012 was primarily due to commercial aircraft orders in excess of deliveries partially offset by cancellation of orders. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. Unobligated backlog increased during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to CH-47 Chinook and V-22 Osprey multi-year contract awards. The increase was partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to incremental funding for the USAF KC-46A Tanker and F-15 multi-year contracts. The increase in unobligated backlog during 2012 was due to increases at BDS of $2,720 million compared with 2011 primarily due to F-15 orders and the contract award for the Space Launch System program received in 2012. Additional ConsiderationsKC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver 4 next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This contract is a fixed-price incentive firm contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. Changes to our estimated cost to perform the work could result in a material charge. This contract contains production options. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. For segment reporting purposes, backlog, revenues and costs are recorded in the Commercial Airplanes and BMA segments.23Table of ContentsSegment Results of Operations and Financial ConditionCommercial AirplanesBusiness Environment and TrendsAirline Industry Environment Global economic activity and global trade, which are the primary drivers of air travel and air cargo growth, grew below the long-term average for the second year in a row in 2013. Despite this, passenger traffic grew by 5% annually in 2012 and 2013 and is forecast to continue at or near the long-term trend of 5% in 2014. There continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models, with airlines operating in emerging economies and low-cost-carriers leading growth. In contrast, air cargo traffic declined in 2012 and grew by an estimated 1 to 2% in 2013 with continued improvement projected in 2014. The relative weakness of the air cargo market has impacted near-term demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions, and we continue to monitor the impact of this trend on our business.Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more fuel efficient airplanes and by employing efficiency generating service offerings in a high-fuel-price environment. Net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to total $13 billion in 2013 compared to $7 billion in 2012. Nonetheless, these profit levels reflect low profit margins for the industry, and risk remains due to ongoing economic and political uncertainty. The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger and cargo traffic, based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $4.8 trillion market for 35,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years.The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, and increased global environmental regulations.Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 14% of Commercial Airplanes’ contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines, including cargo carriers.We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above 90 seats. Many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment 24Table of Contentshas resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors’ revenues and profits. Competitors routinely respond to a relatively weaker U.S. dollar by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. If the U.S. dollar strengthens, competitors can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings.We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively.Operating Results(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2013 2012 2011Revenues$52,981 $49,127 $36,171% of total company revenues61% 60% 53%Earnings from operations$5,795 $4,711 $3,495Operating margins10.9% 9.6% 9.7%Research and development$1,807 $2,049 $2,715Contractual backlog$372,980 $317,287 $293,303Unobligated backlog$660 $1,466 $2,088Revenues Revenues in 2013 increased by $3,854 million or 8% compared with 2012 due to higher new airplane deliveries. Revenues in 2012 increased by $12,956 million or 36% compared with 2011 primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries across all programs.Commercial airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: 737 747 767 777 787 Total2013 Cumulative deliveries4,733 1,482 1,061 1,164 114 Deliveries440(1) 24 21 98 65(2) 6482012 Cumulative deliveries4,293 1,458 1,040 1,066 49 Deliveries415(1) 31 26 83 46(2) 6012011 Cumulative deliveries3,878 1,427 1,014 983 3 Deliveries372(1) 9 20 73 3 477(1)Includes intercompany deliveries of eight aircraft in 2013, nine in 2012 and seven in 2011.(2)Includes one aircraft in 2013 and three in 2012 accounted for as revenues by BCA and as operating leases in consolidation.25Table of ContentsEarnings From Operations Earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $1,084 million or 23% compared with 2012. Earnings increased by $842 million primarily driven by higher new airplane deliveries and lower research and development cost of $242 million due to lower spending on the 787 program partially offset by higher spending on the 737 MAX and 777X. Operating margins increased from 9.6% in 2012 to 10.9% in 2013 primarily due to higher deliveries and lower research and development cost partially offset by the dilutive impact of 787 deliveries.Earnings from operations in 2012 increased by $1,216 million or 35% compared with 2011. This was primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries, which drove an increase in earnings of $1,292 million, and lower research and development expense of $666 million primarily due to lower spending on the 747-8 and 787-8 programs. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings of $742 million driven by higher fleet support costs, increased operating costs associated with business growth, other period costs and decreased earnings from commercial aviation services. The decrease in operating margins from 9.7% in 2011 to 9.6% in 2012 was primarily due to the dilutive effect of the 787 and 747-8 deliveries.Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers.The increase in contractual backlog during 2013 and 2012 was due to orders in excess of deliveries partially reduced by cancellation of orders and changes in projected revenue escalation. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2013 was due to the reclassification from unobligated to contractual backlog related to incremental funding of the existing multi-year contract for Commercial Airplanes’ share of the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract.Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.26Table of ContentsThe following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. Program 737 747 767 777 7872013 Program accounting quantities7,000 1,574 1,113 1,550 1,300Undelivered units under firm orders3,680 55 49 380 916Cumulative firm orders8,413 1,537 1,110 1,544 1,0302012 Program accounting quantities6,600 1,574 1,103 1,450 1,100Undelivered units under firm orders3,074 67 68 365 799Cumulative firm orders7,367 1,525 1,108 1,431 8482011 Program accounting quantities6,200 1,549 1,084 1,350 1,100Undelivered units under firm orders2,365 97 72 380 857Cumulative firm orders6,243 1,524 1,086 1,363 860Program Highlights737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 400 units during 2013 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The accounting quantity includes NG and MAX units. We increased our production rate from 35 to 38 per month in the first quarter of 2013 and a further increase to 42 per month is planned for the second quarter of 2014. On October 31, 2013, we announced plans to increase production of the 737 to 47 airplanes per month beginning in 2017. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017.747 Program Continued weakness in the air cargo market and lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger aircraft have resulted in pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. We continued to produce at a rate of 2 per month during 2013. In April 2013, we announced that the production rate would be decreased from 2 per month to 1.75 per month starting January 2014 and in October 2013 we announced that we would further reduce the production rate to 1.5 per month from February 2014 through the end of 2015. We continue to have a number of unsold 747 production positions and remain focused on obtaining additional orders, reducing out-of-sequence work, improving supply chain efficiency and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If market and production risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face a reach-forward loss that may be material.767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 10 units during 2013 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. During the third quarter of 2013 we reconfigured the 767 assembly line to include a 767 derivative to support the Tanker program and decreased our production rate from 2 to 1 per month. We expect to increase the commercial rate to 1.5 per month in 2014 and back to 2 per month in 2016.777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 100 units during 2013 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We increased our production rate from 7 to 8.3 per month in the first quarter of 2013. In November 2013 we launched the 777X and first delivery is expected in 2020.27Table of Contents787 Program We delivered 65 aircraft in 2013 bringing cumulative deliveries to 114. In January 2013, following battery-related incidents on two 787 aircraft, the Federal Aviation Administration required U.S. aircraft operators to suspend operations of all 787 aircraft. International government regulators also issued directives to the same effect. We continued production but suspended deliveries until appropriate clearances were granted. During the second quarter, we installed a comprehensive set of battery system improvements on 50 previously-delivered 787 airplanes and resumed 787 deliveries to customers. In May 2013, we achieved a production rate of 7 per month in final assembly. We began the production rate increase to 10 per month in final assembly in November 2013 with first deliveries expected to occur at that rate in early 2014. The first 787-9 derivative began final assembly in May 2013 and completed first flight on September 17, 2013. Production and flight testing of the 787-9 continues to be on schedule and we expect the first customer delivery to occur in mid-2014. In June 2013, we announced the launch of the 787-10 derivative aircraft with first delivery targeted for 2018.We continue to incorporate engineering and other design changes identified during 787-8 flight testing into already completed aircraft at our Everett modification center. We also remain focused on stabilizing 787 production rates at 10 per month while continuing to improve aircraft reliability and satisfy customer mission and performance requirements. We continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly, including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, as well as the incorporation of the 787-9 derivative into the manufacturing process. In addition, we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes, including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions.During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense. We have finalized orders for two of the three remaining flight test aircraft. We continue to believe that the remaining 787 flight-test aircraft is commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to that airplane in program inventory. If we determine that the remaining aircraft cannot be sold, we may incur additional charges related to the reclassification of costs associated with this aircraft to research and development expense.During the third quarter of 2013 we increased the accounting quantity to 1,300 units from 1,100 units to reflect incorporation of revenue and cost estimates associated with the 787-10 and plans to increase production rates to 12 and 14 per month in future years. The accounting quantity of 1,300 units continues to represent approximately 10 years of production at planned production rates. The combination of production challenges, change incorporation, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts has created significant pressure on program profitability. If risks related to this program, including risks associated with planned production rate increases, or introducing the 787-9 and 787-10 derivatives as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, as well as further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks.Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services.28Table of ContentsProgram Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013.Additional ConsiderationsThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-9, 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors in aircraft purchase contracts, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.29Table of ContentsDefense, Space & SecurityBusiness Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment Overview U.S. government appropriation levels remain subject to significant uncertainty. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. The Act also provided that the defense budget would face “sequestration” cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. The impact of sequestration cuts was reduced with respect to FY2014 and FY2015 following the enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act in December 2013. However, significant uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts.In addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and other government agencies (including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) within the overall budgetary framework described above. While the FY2014 appropriations finalized in January 2014 included funding for Boeing’s major programs, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in FY2015 and beyond will affect Boeing’s programs. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition to the risks described above, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which could have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts or sequestration impacts. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories, while faced with constrained budgets. In Europe, the continuing financial challenges are forcing governments to institute austerity measures negatively impacting defense spending in the near term.The strongest opportunities for BDS in 2014 will be the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions where the relative financial strength of these economies, coupled with a broad spectrum of evolving threats, will result in procurement of defense and security systems.30Table of ContentsBDS RealignmentEffective January 1, 2013, 2012 and 2011, certain programs were realigned among BDS segments. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment.Operating Results (Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2013 2012 2011Revenues$33,197 $32,607 $31,976% of total company revenues38% 40% 47%Earnings from operations$3,235 $3,068 $3,158Operating margins9.7% 9.4% 9.9%Contractual backlog$49,681 $55,068 $46,354Unobligated backlog$17,607 $16,407 $13,687Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues, earnings and backlog may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.Revenues BDS revenues in 2013 increased by $590 million compared with 2012 due to higher revenues of $601 million and $72 million in the N&SS and GS&S segments, partially offset by lower revenues of $83 million in the BMA segment.BDS revenues in 2012 increased by $631 million compared with 2011, due to higher revenues of $1,434 million and $250 million in the BMA and GS&S segments, partially offset by lower revenues of $1,053 million in the N&SS segment. Earnings From Operations BDS earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $167 million compared with 2012 due to higher earnings of $157 million and $34 million in the N&SS and GS&S segments, partially offset by lower earnings of $24 million in the BMA segment. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $137 million lower in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily reflecting lower favorable adjustments in the BMA segment.BDS earnings from operations in 2012 decreased by $90 million compared with 2011 due to lower earnings of $197 million in the N&SS segment, partially offset by higher earnings of $58 million and $49 million in the BMA and GS&S segments. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $150 million higher in 2012 compared with 2011, primarily reflecting higher favorable adjustments in the BMA segment.31Table of ContentsBacklogTotal backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog was $67,288 million at December 31, 2013, reflecting a decrease of 6% from December 31, 2012. BDS total backlog increased by 19% in 2012, from $60,041 million to $71,475 million. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional ConsiderationsOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Proprietary and Space Launch Systems programs.Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C), India P-8I, Saudi Arabia F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, and commercial and military satellites.Boeing Military Aircraft Operating Results(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2013 2012 2011Revenues$15,936 $16,019 $14,585% of total company revenues18% 20% 21%Earnings from operations$1,465 $1,489 $1,431Operating margins9.2% 9.3% 9.8%Contractual backlog$24,825 $29,226 $23,629Unobligated backlog$10,599 $9,270 $7,146Revenues BMA revenues in 2013 decreased by $83 million compared with 2012 primarily due to a reduction of $1,299 million related to fewer deliveries of AEW&C aircraft, and customer and delivery mix for the F-18 and C-17 programs. This reduction was partially offset by an increase of $1,168 million related to higher 2013 deliveries of P-8 aircraft and Apache rotorcraft, as well as non-recurring effort on several Chinook programs. BMA revenues in 2012 increased by $1,434 million or 10% compared with 2011 primarily due to higher deliveries on the P-8A and Apache programs of $1,050 million and higher milestone revenue of $426 32Table of Contentsmillion on the KC-46A Tanker program. In addition, F-15 program revenues were $450 million higher reflecting initial revenues on the contract for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia partially offset by lower F-15 deliveries. These increases were partially offset by decreases of $723 million related to fewer deliveries of C-17 aircraft in 2012 and the conclusion of the KC-767 International Tanker program in 2011.Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows:Years ended December 31,2013 2012 2011F/A-18 Models48 48 49F-15E Eagle14 8 15C-17 Globemaster III10 10 13CH-47 Chinook44 51 32AH-64 Apache37 19 AEW&C 3 3P-8 Models11 5 KC-767 International Tanker 3Total new-build production aircraft164 144 115Earnings From Operations BMA earnings from operations in 2013 decreased by $24 million compared with 2012 primarily due to lower earnings on the AEW&C and higher 2012 earnings related to the initial revenues on the Saudi F-15 program. The lower earnings were partially offset by higher earnings on the P-8 and Apache program due to increased deliveries and higher revenues. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $146 million lower in 2013 than in 2012, primarily driven by less favorable adjustments to the F-15 program and unfavorable adjustments to the AEW&C program. In the third quarter of 2013, we decided to end production of C-17 aircraft in 2015. See Note 11. Also in the third quarter of 2013, we recorded a charge of $64 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of The Republic of Korea's announcement that it will restart its F-X fighter aircraft competition.BMA earnings from operations in 2012 increased by $58 million compared with 2011 primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries on the P-8A and Apache programs and reach-forward loss provisions in 2011 on the KC-767 International Tanker program. These increases were partially offset by fewer aircraft deliveries on the C-17 program and higher research and development costs. The increase in earnings includes net favorable cumulative catch-up contract adjustments which were $139 million higher in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily reflecting favorable adjustments on the F-15 and Chinook programs.BacklogBMA total backlog was $35,424 million at December 31, 2013, reflecting a decrease of 8% from December 31, 2012 primarily due to revenues recognized on F-15, F-18 and C-17 program contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by CH-47 Chinook and V-22 Osprey multi-year contract awards. BMA total backlog in 2012 increased by 25% from 2011, primarily due to F-15 and C-17 orders.

This increase was partially offset by lower revenues of $196 million on our electronic and information solutions programs. N&SS revenues in 2012 decreased by $1,053 million or 12% compared with 2011 primarily due to $835 million of lower revenues on the Brigade Combat Team Modernization (BCTM) program, which was terminated for convenience during 2011. In addition, customer funding constraints on the GMD program and conclusion of the Space Shuttle program in 2011 reduced revenues by a total of $251 million. These decreases were partially offset by higher Space & Intelligence Systems revenues of $178 million due to larger volume of deliveries in 2012.Delta launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows:Years ended December 31,2013 2012 2011Commercial and civil satellites3 3 1Military satellites4 7 3Earnings From Operations N&SS earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $157 million or 28% compared with 2012 primarily due to higher revenues and mix in our civil and commercial satellite programs and the Space Launch Systems program. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from our United Space Alliance (USA) joint venture reflecting a gain of $39 million recorded in the third quarter of 2012 related to the termination and settlement of USA's defined benefit pension plans. The impact of net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was not significant in 2013.N&SS earnings from operations in 2012 decreased by $197 million or 26% compared with 2011 primarily due to lower revenues on the BCTM program and a $42 million charge related to a contract restructure of an electronic and mission system program. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $56 million lower in 2012 than in 2011 primarily reflecting the $42 million charge described above. N&SS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $171 million, $180 million and $194 million from the USA joint venture and the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. 34Table of ContentsBacklogN&SS total backlog was $15,908 million at December 31, 2013, reflecting a decrease of 7% from December 31, 2012 primarily due to revenues recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by government and commercial satellite contract awards. N&SS total backlog increased by 7% in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily due to the contract award for the Space Launch System program, partially offset by current year deliveries and sales on contracts awarded in prior years.

GS&S revenues in 2012 increased by $250 million compared with 2011 primarily due to higher volume in several IL programs, including contracts to support Chinook and C-17 aircraft, and higher TSGS revenues primarily related to the P-8A program. Earnings From Operations GS&S earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $34 million compared with 2012 primarily due to higher revenues and improved performance on several TSGS programs. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2013 were largely unchanged from 2012. GS&S earnings from operations in 2012 increased by $49 million compared to 2011 primarily due to improved performance on several MM&U programs and higher revenues on several IL programs.

This change does not affect operations or customer interactions. On January 23, 2013, Boeing issued full and unconditional guarantees of all of the outstanding publicly-issued debt securities of BCC. Funding requirements will be provided to BCC through intercompany loans from Boeing and we will continue to target a BCC debt-to-equity ratio of 5.0-to-1. As described in Note 13, on May 3, 2013, Boeing issued $500 million of notes and entered into a concurrent intercompany loan with BCC on the same terms. Interest expense associated with these notes is included in Boeing Capital interest expense. Effective January 1, 2013, BCC's accounting for certain leasing transactions was aligned with Boeing. Segment information previously reported has been adjusted to reflect this change.Business Environment and TrendsBCC’s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2013 totaled $3,921 million. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is concentrated among certain U.S. commercial airline customers. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably out-of-production Boeing aircraft such as 717 aircraft.BCC provided customer financing of $220 million and $364 million during 2013 and 2012. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2014, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources.Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,100 western-built commercial jet aircraft (9.2% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2013, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 20% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2012 and 2011, 10% and 9.4% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.Operating Results (Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2013 2012 2011Revenues$408 $468 $547Earnings from operations$107 $88 $119Operating margins26% 19% 22%RevenuesBCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2013 decreased by $60 million compared with 2012 primarily due to lower other income and operating lease income. Other income decreased due to lower aircraft return condition payments. BCC’s revenues in 2012 decreased 36Table of Contents$79 million compared with 2011 primarily due to lower operating and finance lease income. Operating lease income decreased as a result of the return of aircraft and lower lease rates on re-leased aircraft. In addition, lower finance lease income reflects the revised contractual terms of BCC’s leases with AirTran Airways Inc. (Airtran), a wholly owned subsidiary of Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest), negotiated in conjunction with receiving a full guarantee from Southwest of those lease payment obligations in the fourth quarter of 2011.Earnings From Operations BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, recovery of losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $19 million compared with 2012 primarily due to lower depreciation expense and interest expense offset by lower revenues. Earnings from operations in 2012 decreased by $31 million compared with 2011 primarily due to lower revenues partially offset by lower interest and asset impairment expense.Financial PositionThe following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31:(Dollars in millions)2013 2012Customer financing and investment portfolio, net$3,883 $4,290Other assets, primarily cash and short-term investments505 402Total assets$4,388 $4,692 Other liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes$1,296 $1,429Debt, including intercompany loans2,577 2,742Equity515 521Total liabilities and equity$4,388 $4,692 Debt-to-equity ratio5.0-to-1 5.3-to-1The customer financing portfolio and debt balances presented above as of December 31, 2012 have been revised from balances previously reported in the BCC 2012 10-K filing to reflect the alignment of BCC's accounting to the consolidated Boeing accounting for certain leasing transactions within the portfolio.BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2013 decreased from December 31, 2012 primarily due to normal portfolio run-off and asset sales, partially offset by the origination of notes receivable. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, BCC had $83 million and $354 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, of which $57 million and $266 million had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $36 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2014. These aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and $11 million of these aircraft were committed at December 31, 2013.BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in the Other segment, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.37Table of ContentsBankruptciesIn 2011, American Airlines, Inc. (American Airlines) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On December 9, 2013, American Airlines emerged from bankruptcy. Upon emergence from bankruptcy, the parent of American Airlines merged with US Airways Group, Inc., the parent of US Airways, to form American Airlines Group Inc., and American Airlines assumed all of the BCC financing agreements and underlying leases. At December 31, 2013, American Airlines accounted for $445 million of our customer financing portfolio, of which $371 million represents collateral for $233 million of non-recourse debt. Restructurings and Restructuring RequestsFrom time to time, certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. During 2013, BCC did not reach agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position.Other Segment(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,2013 2012 2011Revenues$102 $106 $123Earnings/(Loss) from operations(156) (186) 39Other segment losses in 2013 decreased by $30 million compared with 2012 primarily related to the insurance recoveries in the third quarter of 2013. Other segment losses in 2012 increased by $225 million compared with 2011 primarily due to a $241 million reduction in the allowance for losses on AirTran receivables in 2011. Lower environmental expense of $82 million in 2012 compared with 2011 was largely offset by higher costs related to BCC guarantees and increases in other costs.

The increases of $0.7 billion in 2013 and $3.5 billion in 2012 were primarily due to increased customer receipts reflecting higher delivery and order volumes in 38Table of Contents2013 and 2012. Our investment in gross inventories increased by $5.7 billion in 2013, $6.2 billion in 2012 and $9.8 billion in 2011, driven by continued investment in commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787 inventory. Advances and progress billings increased by $3.9 billion in 2013, $1.9 billion in 2012 and $5 billion in 2011, primarily due to payments from commercial airplane customers. Discretionary contributions to our pension plans totaled $1.5 billion in 2013 compared with $1.6 billion in 2012 and $0.5 billion in 2011. Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities totaled $5.2 billion during 2013 compared with $3.8 billion used during 2012 and $2.4 billion provided during 2011, largely due to higher net contributions to investments in time deposits. Net contributions to investments were $2.9 billion in 2013 compared with $2 billion in 2012 and net proceeds from investments of $4 billion in 2011. In 2013, capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion in the prior two years. We expect capital expenditures to remain higher in 2014 due to continued investment to support growth.Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $4.2 billion during 2013, an increase of $0.8 billion compared with 2012 primarily due to share repurchases of $2.8 billion in 2013 partially offset by higher new borrowings of $0.5 billion, lower debt repayments of $0.6 billion and an increase in stock options exercised of $1 billion in the current year. Cash used by financing activities was $3.5 billion during 2012, an increase of $1.8 billion compared with 2011 as a result of higher debt repayments of $1.1 billion and lower new borrowings of $0.7 billion.In 2013, we issued notes totaling $0.5 billion to fund the BCC segment and repaid $1.4 billion of debt, including repayments of $0.6 billion of debt held at BCC. At December 31, 2013 and 2012, the recorded balance of debt was $9.6 billion and $10.4 billion, of which $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion were classified as short-term. This includes $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion of debt attributable to BCC, of which $0.7 billion was classified as short-term in both periods.During 2013, we repurchased 25.4 million shares totaling $2.8 billion through our open market share repurchase program. There were no shares repurchased through the share repurchase program in 2012 and 2011. In 2013 and 2012, we had 0.8 million and 1 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2013 and at December 31, 2013, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $4.8 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs.Financing commitments totaled $18 billion and $18.1 billion at December 31, 2013 and 2012. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required.In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities.39Table of ContentsAt December 31, 2013 and 2012, our pension plans were $10.5 billion and $19.7 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2013 with minimal required contributions in 2014. We expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $750 million in 2014. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.At December 31, 2013, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2013, and the estimated timing thereof.(Dollars in millions)Total Lessthan 1year 1-3years 3-5years After 5yearsLong-term debt (including current portion)$9,517 $1,490 $1,893 $682 $5,452Interest on debt(1)6,484 502 893 813 4,276Pension and other postretirement cash requirements15,329 577 3,005 6,803 4,944Capital lease obligations156 72 70 14 Operating lease obligations1,414 228 319 217 650Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position123,904 46,938 41,985 19,344 15,637Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position15,849 15,191 658 Total contractual obligations$172,653 $64,998 $48,823 $27,873 $30,959(1) Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2013. Variable rate debt was less than 2% of our total debt at December 31, 2013.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Approximately 4% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts.40Table of ContentsPurchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2013, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2013, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $18.4 billion that extend through 2030. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2013, our net asset for income taxes receivable, including uncertain tax positions, was $24 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. Our income tax matters are excluded from the table above. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.41Table of ContentsCommercial CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2013.(Dollars in millions)Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3years 4-5years After 5yearsStandby letters of credit and surety bonds$4,376 $2,525 $1,720 $83 $48Commercial aircraft financing commitments17,987 2,309 6,171 4,956 4,551Total commercial commitments$22,363 $4,834 $7,891 $5,039 $4,599Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Contingent ObligationsWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, including certain employment, labor and benefits litigation. Note 20 also addresses the settlement of the A-12 aircraft litigation. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $649 million at December 31, 2013. For additional information, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Income Taxes We have recorded a liability of $1,141 million at December 31, 2013 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.42Table of ContentsNon-GAAP MeasuresCore Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per ShareOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expenses which represent costs not attributable to business segments - see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP MeasuresThe table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share.

Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ending December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 net cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all BDS contracts increased operating earnings by $242 million, $379 million and $229 million, respectively.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2013 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $332 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.Program AccountingProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling 44Table of Contentsand other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends.To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2013 had been estimated to be lower by 1%, it would have increased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $460 million. If the combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2013 (excluding the 747 and 787 programs which had gross margins that were breakeven or near breakeven during 2013) had been estimated to be higher by 1%, it would have decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $354 million. If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if we are required to change one or more of our pricing, cost or other assumptions related to these programs, we could be required to record reach forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible ImpairmentsWe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.45Table of ContentsThe cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2013 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2013, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had $497 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would reduce the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets by less than $1 million.Pension PlansThe majority of our employees are earning benefits under defined benefit pension plans. All nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2013.(Dollars in millions)Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bpsPension plans Projected benefit obligation($2,043) $2,543Net periodic pension cost(227) 279Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2013 net periodic pension expense by $131 million. We expect 2014 net periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately $1,400 million and the portion recognized in earnings for 2014 to increase by approximately $100 million primarily due to amortization of actuarial losses.46Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate RiskWe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2013, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2013, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by $244 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by $244 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.47Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:50.687890

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations and Financial ConditionOverviewWe are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in many countries and rely on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security (BDS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Commercial Airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits us as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets sometimes offset. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.Consolidated Results of OperationsEarnings From Operations and Core Operating Earnings (Non-GAAP) The following table summarizes key indicators of consolidated results of operations:(Dollars in millions, except per share data) Years ended December 31,2014 2013 2012Revenues$90,762 $86,623 $81,698 GAAP Earnings from operations7,473 6,562 6,290Operating margins8.2% 7.6% 7.7%Effective income tax rate23.7% 26.4% 34.0%Net earnings$5,446 $4,585 $3,900Diluted earnings per share$7.38 $5.96 $5.11 Non-GAAP (1) Core operating earnings$8,860 $7,876 $7,189Core operating margin9.8% 9.1% 8.8%Core earnings per share$8.60 $7.07 $5.88(1)These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense.

Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $7,009 million primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries. BDS revenues decreased by $2,316 million due to lower revenues in all three segments. Revenues in 2013 increased by $4,925 million or 6% compared with 2012. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $3,854 million due to higher new airplane deliveries. BDS revenues increased by $590 million due to higher revenues in the Network & Space Systems (N&SS) and Global Services & Support (GS&S) segments, partially offset by lower revenues in the Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) segment. The change in unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2014, 2013 and 2012 primarily reflects the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries. Earnings From OperationsThe following table summarizes Earnings from operations:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2014 2013 2012Commercial Airplanes$6,411 $5,795 $4,711Defense, Space & Security3,133 3,235 3,068Boeing Capital92 107 88Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense (1,387) (1,314) (899)Other unallocated items and eliminations(776) (1,261) (678)Earnings from operations (GAAP)$7,473 $6,562 $6,290Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense1,387 1,314 899Core operating earnings (Non-GAAP)$8,860 $7,876 $7,189Earnings from operations in 2014 increased by $911 million compared with 2013 primarily reflecting higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes of $616 million and lower unallocated items and eliminations of $485 million. The decrease in unallocated items is due to the A-12 litigation settlement of $406 million which was recorded in 2013 and lower 2014 deferred compensation of $194 million. Earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $272 million compared with 2012. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $1,084 million primarily reflecting higher new airplane deliveries and lower research and development expense. BDS earnings increased by $167 million due to higher earnings in the N&SS and BMA segments partially offset by lower earnings in the GS&S segment. Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense in 2013 reduced earnings by $415 million compared with 2012 due to higher unallocated pension expense offset by lower unallocated other postretirement expense. Other unallocated items and eliminations in 2013 reduced earnings by $583 million primarily due to a charge recorded in 2013 related to the settlement of the A-12 aircraft litigation and higher 2013 deferred 20Table of Contentscompensation expense. The A-12 aircraft litigation settlement resulted in the Company recording a $406 million pre-tax charge in 2013, which consisted of writing-off A-12 inventory, recorded as cost of sales, and providing three EA-18G Growlers at no cost to the U.S. Navy, recorded as a reduction in revenues. Core operating earnings in 2014 increased by $984 million compared with 2013 primarily reflecting higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes and the 2013 A-12 charge. Core operating earnings in 2013 increased by $687 million compared with 2012 as higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes and BDS more than offset the A-12 charge and higher 2013 deferred compensation expense.Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2014 2013 2012Share-based plans($67) ($95) ($81)Deferred compensation(44) (238) (75)Eliminations and other(665) (522) (643)Litigation settlements (406) 121Sub-total (included in core operating earnings*)(776) (1,261) (678)Pension(1,469) (1,374) (787)Postretirement82 60 (112)Pension and other postretirement benefit expense (excluded from core operating earnings*)(1,387) (1,314) (899)Total unallocated items, eliminations and other($2,163) ($2,575) ($1,577)* Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See page 42.Deferred compensation expense decreased by $194 million in 2014 and increased by $163 million in 2013, primarily driven by changes in our stock price.Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $143 million in 2014 decreased by $121 million in 2013 primarily due to insurance recoveries which were recorded in the third quarter of 2013. Litigation settlements include the 2013 charge of $406 million related to the settlement of the A-12 litigation and the $121 million benefit recorded in 2012 due to a favorable court judgment on satellite litigation.Net periodic benefit cost related to pension and other postretirement benefits totaled $2,483 million, $3,769 million and $3,383 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. The decrease in 2014 net periodic benefit cost related to pension is primarily due to lower amortization of actuarial losses due to higher discount rates which more than offset higher 2014 curtailment charges. The increase in 2013 is primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service costs driven by lower discount rates. Unallocated pension expense in 2014 reflects pension charges of $395 million, primarily for pension curtailment costs. See Note 14. The unallocated pension expense in 2013 reflects a pension curtailment charge of $73 million related to the decision in September 2013 to end production of the C-17 aircraft in 2015. See Note 11. During the third quarter of 2013 we also determined that the pension expense in prior years was overstated and recorded a reduction in pension expense of $63 million. A portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods. Costs are allocated to the business segments as described in Note 21.21Table of ContentsNet periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows:(Dollars in millions)Pension Other PostretirementBenefitsYears ended December 31,2014 2013 2012 2014 2013 2012Allocated to business segments($1,746) ($1,662) ($1,620) ($369) ($413) ($431)Unallocated items, eliminations and other(1,469) (1,374) (787) 82 60 (112)Total($3,215) ($3,036) ($2,407) ($287) ($353) ($543)Other Earnings Items(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2014 2013 2012Earnings from operations$7,473 $6,562 $6,290Other income, net(3) 56 62Interest and debt expense(333) (386) (442)Earnings before income taxes7,137 6,232 5,910Income tax expense(1,691) (1,646) (2,007)Net earnings from continuing operations$5,446 $4,586 $3,903Interest and debt expense decreased by $53 million in 2014 and $56 million in 2013 as a result of lower weighted average debt balances.Our effective income tax rates were 23.7%, 26.4% and 34.0% for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Our 2014 effective tax rate was lower than 2013 primarily due to tax benefits of $265 million related to tax basis adjustments and $259 million related to audit settlements, both recorded in the second quarter of 2014. Our 2013 effective tax rate was lower than 2012 due to research tax credits for the 2013 and 2012 tax years that were both recorded in 2013 and the issuance of research and experimental regulations which resulted in $212 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits being recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales and BDS predominantly uses contract accounting. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. Under contract accounting, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. 22Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes cost of sales:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2014 2013Change 2013 2012ChangeCost of sales$76,752 $73,268$3,484 $73,268 $68,665$4,603Cost of sales as a % of revenues84.6% 84.6%0.0% 84.6% 84.0%0.6%Cost of sales in 2014 increased by $3,484 million, or 5% compared with the same period in 2013, primarily driven by the increase in revenue. Cost of sales at Commercial Airplanes increased by $6,265 million, or 14%, primarily driven by the 13% increase in revenues. Cost of sales at BDS decreased by $2,085 million, or 8% primarily due to the 7% reduction in revenues. Cost of sales increased in 2013 by $4,603 million, or 7% compared with the prior year primarily driven by the 6% increase in revenues and higher unallocated pension and other postretirement costs. Cost of sales at Commercial Airplanes increased by $2,957 million, or 7%, primarily driven by the 8% increase in revenues and cost of sales at BDS increased by $407 million, primarily driven by the 2% increase in revenues. Research and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2014 2013 2012Commercial Airplanes$1,881 $1,807 $2,049Defense, Space & Security1,158 1,215 1,189Other8 49 60Total$3,047 $3,071 $3,298Research and development expense in 2014 decreased by $24 million compared to 2013. Commercial Airplanes spending increased on 777X, 787-10 and 737 MAX partially offset by lower spending on the 787-9. Research and development expense in 2013 decreased by $227 million compared to 2012 primarily due to lower spending at Commercial Airplanes on the 787 program partially offset by increased spending on the 737 MAX and 777X.BacklogOur backlog at December 31 was as follows:(Dollars in millions)2014 2013 2012Contractual Backlog: Commercial Airplanes$440,118 $372,980 $317,287Defense, Space & Security: Boeing Military Aircraft21,143 23,604 27,898Network & Space Systems8,935 9,832 10,078Global Services & Support16,896 16,245 17,092Total Defense, Space & Security46,974 49,681 55,068Total contractual backlog$487,092 $422,661 $372,355Unobligated backlog$15,299 $18,267 $17,873Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The 23Table of Contentsincrease in contractual backlog at December 31, 2014 compared with December 31, 2013 was primarily due to commercial airplane orders and reclassifications from unobligated backlog related to incremental funding. The increase was partially offset by commercial airplane deliveries and revenues recognized on awarded contracts. The increase in contractual backlog during 2013 was primarily due to commercial aircraft orders in excess of deliveries partially offset by cancellation of orders. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The unobligated backlog at December 31, 2014 decreased from December 31, 2013 primarily due to reclassifications to contractual backlog related to incremental funding for BDS contracts, partially offset by contract awards. The unobligated backlog increased during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to CH-47 Chinook and V-22 Osprey multi-year contract awards. The increase was partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to incremental funding for the U.S. Air Force KC-46A Tanker and F-15 multi-year contracts. Additional ConsiderationsKC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. During the second quarter of 2014, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $425 million on this contract. $238 million of this loss was recorded at our Commercial Airplanes segment and the remaining $187 million was recorded in our BMA segment. The reach-forward loss was primarily due to initial engineering and design issues discovered during systems installation that are requiring rework and additional engineering and manufacturing labor to complete this contract. To date the program has met all customer contractual milestones. This contract contains production options. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. The USAF is scheduled to authorize low rate initial production in 2015 subject to satisfactory progress being made on the development contract. Russia/Ukraine We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted.Segment Results of Operations and Financial ConditionCommercial AirplanesBusiness Environment and TrendsAirline Industry Environment Global economic activity and global trade, which are the primary drivers of the demand for air travel, grew below the long-term average for the third year in a row in 2014. Despite this, passenger traffic grew from 5% to 6% annually between 2012 and 2014 and is forecasted to continue above the long-term trend of 5% in 2015. There continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models, with airlines operating in emerging economies and low-cost-carriers leading growth. 24Table of ContentsAir cargo traffic grew at close to long-term average rates in 2014, with continued improvement projected in 2015. In addition, capacity metrics such as load factors and freighter aircraft utilization are showing signs of improvement. The relative weakness of the air cargo market in recent years has impacted near-term demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions. We continue to closely monitor the impact of this trend on our business.Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes. Net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to total $20 billion in 2014 compared to $11 billion in 2013. Together with strong demand growth, we expect lower oil prices will improve airline profitability in 2015.The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger and cargo traffic, based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $5.2 trillion market for approximately 37,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years.The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations.Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 11% of Commercial Airplanes’ contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines, including cargo carriers.We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above 90 seats. Many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors’ revenues and profits. Competitors routinely respond to a relatively weaker U.S. dollar by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. Competitors can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings.25Table of ContentsWe are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spare parts, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively. Many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. In September 2014, the bank’s charter was extended and is now set to expire on June 30, 2015. If the bank’s charter is not renewed or if the bank’s existing or future funding authority is insufficient to meet our customers’ needs, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay aircraft purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks to the timing of future deliveries and are assisting with alternative third party financing sources.Results of Operations(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2014 2013 2012Revenues$59,990 $52,981 $49,127% of total company revenues66% 61% 60%Earnings from operations$6,411 $5,795 $4,711Operating margins10.7% 10.9% 9.6%Research and development$1,881 $1,807 $2,049Contractual backlog$440,118 $372,980 $317,287Unobligated backlog$360 $660 $1,466Revenues Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $7,009 million or 13% in 2014 compared with 2013 and by $3,854 million or 8% in 2013 compared with 2012 primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries.Commercial Airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: 737*747†767 777 787†Total2014 Cumulative deliveries5,218 1,501 1,067 1,263 228 Deliveries485(15) 19(3) 6 99 114 7232013 Cumulative deliveries4,733 1,482 1,061 1,164 114 Deliveries440(8) 24 21 98 65(1) 6482012 Cumulative deliveries4,293 1,458 1,040 1,066 49 Deliveries415(9) 31 26 83 46(3) 601* Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses†Aircraft accounted for as revenues by Commercial Airplanes and as operating leases in consolidation identified by parentheses26Table of ContentsEarnings From Operations Earnings from operations in 2014 increased by $616 million or 11% compared with 2013. The increase in earnings is primarily due to higher earnings of $947 million driven by higher new airplane deliveries and commercial aviation services revenue growth. This earnings increase was partially offset by a reach-forward loss of $238 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and higher research and development expense of $74 million. The increase in research and development reflects higher spending on the 777X, 787-10 and 737 MAX, which more than offset lower 787-9 spending. Operating margins decreased from 10.9% in 2013 to 10.7% in 2014 primarily due to the dilutive impact of 747 and 787 deliveries and the USAF KC-46A Tanker reach-forward loss.Earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $1,084 million or 23% compared with 2012. The increase in earnings is primarily driven by higher new airplane deliveries of $842 million and lower research and development expense of $242 million due to lower spending on the 787 program partially offset by higher spending on the 737 MAX and 777X. Operating margins increased from 9.6% in 2012 to 10.9% in 2013 primarily due to higher deliveries and lower research and development expense partially offset by the dilutive impact of 787 deliveries.Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers.The increase in contractual backlog during 2014 was due to orders in excess of deliveries partially reduced by cancellation of orders. The increase in contractual backlog during 2013 was due to orders in excess of deliveries partially reduced by cancellation of orders and changes in projected revenue escalation. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2014 and 2013 was due to the reclassification from unobligated to contractual backlog related to incremental funding of the existing multi-year contract for Commercial Airplanes’ share of the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract.Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.27Table of ContentsThe following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders.

Program Highlights737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 800 units during 2014 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The accounting quantity includes NG and MAX units. We increased our production rate from 38 to 42 per month in the second quarter of 2014 and plan an additional increase to 47 per month in 2017. On October 2, 2014 we announced our plan to further increase the rate to 52 per month in 2018. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017.747 Program Lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft has resulted in ongoing pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. We are currently producing at a rate of 1.5 per month with plans to reduce the rate to 1.3 per month in September 2015. We have a number of unsold 747 production positions and remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face a reach-forward loss that may be material.767 Program The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. In October 2014 we increased our combined tanker and commercial production rate from 1 to 1.5 per month and plan to increase to 2 per month in 2016.777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2014 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 8.3 per month. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. 787 Program During the second quarter of 2014 we completed initial type certification for the 787-9 and received design and production certifications. We delivered the first 787-9 airplane in June 2014. First delivery of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018.28Table of ContentsWe are producing at a rate of 10 per month and the first delivery at this rate occurred in March 2014. We remain focused on stabilizing 787 production rates at 10 per month while improving aircraft reliability and satisfying customer mission and performance requirements. We continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly, including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, incorporating changes identified during 787-8 flight testing to already completed aircraft, as well as the incorporation of the 787-9 derivative into the manufacturing process. In addition, we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes, including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions.During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense. Based on sales activity and market interest we continue to believe that the remaining 787 flight-test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to these aircraft in program inventory. If we determine that any of the remaining flight-test aircraft cannot be sold, we may incur additional charges related to the reclassification of costs associated with those aircraft to research and development expense.The accounting quantity of 1,300 units remains unchanged and reflects the incorporation of revenue and cost estimates associated with the 787-10 and planned production rate increases to 12 and 14 per month in future years. The combination of production challenges, change incorporation, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts has created significant pressure on program profitability. If risks related to these challenges, together with risks associated with planned production rate increases or introducing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks.Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services.Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.Reflects models in development during 2014We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013.Additional ConsiderationsThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers 29Table of Contentsand regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.Defense, Space & SecurityBusiness Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment Overview U.S. government appropriation levels remain subject to significant uncertainty. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act (The Act) established limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 U.S. government fiscal years. The Act also provided that the defense budget would face “sequestration” cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. While the impact of sequestration cuts was reduced with respect to FY2014 and FY2015 following the enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act in December 2013, significant uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending. It is likely that U.S. government discretionary spending levels for FY2016 and beyond will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts.Significant uncertainty also continues with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorization and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition to the risks described above, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which could have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts or sequestration impacts. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. The Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2015 enacted December 2014, funds most U.S. government agencies through September 2015, including the U.S. DoD, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories, while faced with constrained budgets. In Europe, the continuing financial challenges are forcing governments to institute austerity measures negatively impacting defense spending in the near term.30Table of ContentsThe strongest opportunities for BDS in 2015 will be the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions where the relative financial strength of these economies, coupled with a broad spectrum of evolving threats, are expected to result in procurement of defense and security systems.BDS RealignmentEffective during the first quarter of 2014, certain programs were realigned between BDS segments. The realignments include certain BMA aircraft and modernization programs which were moved to GS&S. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. See Note 21.

In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows:Years ended December 31,2014 2013 2012F/A-18 Models44 48 48F-15 Models14 14 8C-17 Globemaster III7 10 10CH-47 Chinook54 44 51AH-64 Apache45 37 19P-8 Models11 11 5AEW&C3 3C-40A1 Total new-build production aircraft179 164 144Revenues BDS revenues in 2014 decreased by $2,316 million compared with 2013 primarily due to lower revenues of $1,774 million in the BMA segment and lower revenues of $509 million in the N&SS segment. BDS revenues in 2013 increased by $590 million compared with 2012 due to higher revenues of $601 million 31Table of Contentsand $92 million in the N&SS and GS&S segments, partially offset by lower revenues of $103 million in the BMA segment.Earnings From Operations BDS earnings from operations in 2014 decreased by $102 million compared with 2013 due to lower earnings of $200 million and $21 million in the BMA and N&SS segments, partially offset by higher earnings of $119 million in the GS&S segment. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $96 million higher in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily reflecting higher favorable adjustments in the GS&S segment.BDS earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $167 million compared with 2012 due to higher earnings of $157 million and $17 million in the N&SS and BMA segments, partially offset by lower earnings of $7 million in the GS&S segment. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $137 million lower in 2013 compared with 2012, primarily reflecting lower favorable adjustments in the GS&S and BMA segments.BacklogTotal backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog was $61,913 million at December 31, 2014, reflecting a decrease of 8% from December 31, 2013. BDS total backlog was $67,288 million at December 31, 2013, reflecting a decrease of 6% from December 31, 2012. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional ConsiderationsOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Proprietary and Space Launch System (SLS) programs.Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C), India P-8I, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew and commercial and military satellites.32Table of ContentsBoeing Military Aircraft Results of Operations(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2014 2013 2012Revenues$13,511 $15,285 $15,388% of total company revenues15% 18% 19%Earnings from operations$1,304 $1,504 $1,487Operating margins9.7% 9.8% 9.7%Contractual backlog$21,143 $23,604 $27,898Unobligated backlog$8,030 $10,058 $8,671Revenues BMA revenues in 2014 decreased by $1,774 million, or 12%, compared with 2013 primarily due to a reduction of revenue of $1,730 million related to F-15 and KC-46A Tanker milestones, fewer C-17 aircraft deliveries and delivery mix on the P-8 program.BMA revenues in 2013 decreased by $103 million compared with 2012 primarily due to a reduction of $1,320 million related to fewer deliveries of AEW&C aircraft to Australia and the Republic of Korea and customer and delivery mix for the F/A-18 and C-17 programs. This reduction was partially offset by an increase of $1,168 million related to higher 2013 deliveries of P-8 aircraft and Apache rotorcraft, as well as non-recurring effort on several Chinook programs. Earnings From Operations BMA earnings from operations in 2014 decreased by $200 million, or 13%, compared with 2013 primarily due to 2014 charges of $235 million and lower earnings of $73 million related to fewer deliveries on the C-17 program. The charges recorded in 2014 included $187 million related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and $48 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of our 2014 decision to produce three fewer C-17 aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. See Note 11. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings of $65 million related to improved performance on the F/A-18 program. In addition, in 2013, we recorded a charge of $64 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of the Republic of Korea's announcement to restart its F-X fighter aircraft competition. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $39 million lower in 2014 than in 2013 primarily driven by the reach-forward loss on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract, partially offset by higher favorable adjustments to the F/A-18 and F-15 programs.BMA earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $17 million compared with 2012 primarily due to increased deliveries and higher revenues on the P-8, Apache and Chinook programs of $263 million partially offset by lower earnings of $175 million related to initial revenues in 2012 on the Saudi F-15 program and lower C-17 performance. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $62 million lower in 2013 than in 2012, primarily driven by less favorable adjustments to the F-15 program. In the third quarter of 2013, we decided to end production of C-17 aircraft in 2015. See Note 11. Also in the third quarter of 2013, we recorded a charge of $64 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of the Republic of Korea's announcement that it will restart its F-X fighter aircraft competition.33Table of ContentsBacklogBMA total backlog at December 31, 2014 was $29,173 million, a decrease of 13% reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by contract awards for the F/A-18, P-8 and Apache programs. BMA total backlog was $33,662 million at December 31, 2013, reflecting a decrease of 8% from December 31, 2012 primarily due to revenues recognized on F-15, F/A-18 and C-17 program contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by CH-47 Chinook and V-22 Osprey multi-year contract awards.

Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $12 million higher in 2014 than in 2013.N&SS earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $157 million or 28% compared with 2012 primarily due to higher revenues and mix in our civil and commercial satellite programs and the SLS program. These increases were partially offset by lower earnings from our United Space Alliance (USA) joint venture reflecting a gain of $39 million recorded in the third quarter of 2012 related to the termination and settlement of USA's defined benefit pension plans. The impact of net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was not significant in 2013.N&SS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $211 million, $171 million and $180 million primarily from the ULA joint venture in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. BacklogN&SS total backlog was $14,922 million at December 31, 2014, reflecting a decrease of 6% from December 31, 2013 primarily due to revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by current year contract awards for the Commercial Crew, commercial satellite and missile defense system programs. N&SS total backlog was $15,908 at December 31, 2013, reflecting a decrease of 7% from December 31, 2012 primarily due to revenues recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by government and commercial satellite contract awards.

These decreases were partially offset by higher Maintenance, Modification and Upgrades (MM&U) revenues of $245 million primarily related to deliveries of three AEW&C Peace Eagle to Turkey in 2014.GS&S revenues in 2013 increased by $92 million compared with 2012 primarily due to higher revenues on MM&U and TSGS programs, partially offset by decreases in several IL programs. Earnings From Operations GS&S earnings from operations in 2014 increased by $119 million, or 12%, compared with 2013 primarily due to an increase of $145 million related to improved performance in several MM&U programs, most notably the AEW&C Peace Eagle contract. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $123 million higher in 2014 than in 2013 primarily due to unfavorable adjustments on the AEW&C Peace Eagle contract in 2013. GS&S earnings from operations in 2013 decreased by $7 million compared with 2012 primarily due to lower performance of $59 million in MM&U on the AEW&C Peace Eagle contract partially offset by $44 million of higher revenues and improved performance on several TSGS programs. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2013 were $90 million lower than in 2012 primarily due to higher unfavorable adjustments on the AEW&C Peace Eagle contract. BacklogGS&S total backlog has remained consistent at $17,818 million, $17,718 million and $17,891 million at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Boeing CapitalBusiness Environment and TrendsBCC’s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2014 totaled $3,506 million. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is concentrated among certain U.S. commercial airline customers. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably out-of-production Boeing aircraft such as 717 aircraft.BCC provided customer financing of $489 million and $220 million during 2014 and 2013. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2015, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources.Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,300 western-built commercial jet aircraft (9.8% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2014, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 15% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2013 and 2012, 9.2% and 10.0% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.36Table of ContentsResults of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2014 2013 2012Revenues$416 $408 $468Earnings from operations$92 $107 $88Operating margins22% 26% 19%RevenuesBCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2014 increased by $8 million compared with 2013 primarily due to higher aircraft return condition payments of $60 million, partially offset by a decrease in finance lease income and lower interest income. BCC’s revenues in 2013 decreased by $60 million compared with 2012 primarily due to lower other income driven by lower aircraft return condition payments and operating lease income. Earnings From Operations BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2014 decreased by $15 million compared with 2013 due to $60 million increase in asset impairment expense, partially offset by a reduction in the provision for losses on receivables, driven by a change to a customer credit rating recorded in the first quarter of 2014, in addition to lower depreciation and interest expense. Earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $19 million compared with 2012 primarily due to lower depreciation expense and interest expense offset by lower revenues. Financial PositionThe following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31:(Dollars in millions)2014 2013Customer financing and investment portfolio, net$3,493 $3,883Other assets, primarily cash and short-term investments615 505Total assets$4,108 $4,388 Other liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes$1,212 $1,296Debt, including intercompany loans2,412 2,577Equity484 515Total liabilities and equity$4,108 $4,388 Debt-to-equity ratio5.0-to-1 5.0-to-1BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2014 decreased from December 31, 2013 primarily due to portfolio run-off, partially offset by the origination of notes receivable and equipment under operating lease totaling $489 million. At December 31, 2014 and 2013, BCC had $48 million and $83 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $183 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2015. We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended.37Table of ContentsBCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.On October 31, 2014, Boeing issued $850 million of fixed and floating rate notes and entered into a concurrent intercompany loan on the same terms with BCC for $550 million, comprised of $300 million of fixed rate notes and $250 million of floating rate notes. Interest expense associated with these intercompany notes is included in Boeing Capital interest expense. See Note 13.Restructurings and Restructuring Requests From time to time, certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. During 2014, BCC did not reach agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow Summary(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2014 2013 2012Net earnings$5,446 $4,585 $3,900Non-cash items2,515 2,516 2,728Changes in working capital897 1,078 880Net cash provided by operating activities8,858 8,179 7,508Net cash provided/(used) by investing activities2,467 (5,154) (3,757)Net cash used by financing activities(8,593) (4,249) (3,477)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(87) (29) 18Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents2,645 (1,253) 292Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year9,088 10,341 10,049Cash and cash equivalents at end of period$11,733 $9,088 $10,341Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $8.9 billion during 2014, compared with $8.2 billion during 2013 and $7.5 billion in 2012. The increase of $0.7 billion in 2014 was primarily due to higher customer advances which more than offset higher gross inventory. The increase of $0.7 billion in 2013 was primarily due to increased customer receipts reflecting higher delivery and order volumes in 2013. Our investment in gross inventories increased by $7.6 billion in 2014, $5.7 billion in 2013 and $6.2 billion in 2012, driven by continued investment in commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787 inventory. Advances and progress billings increased by $6.9 billion in 2014, $3.9 billion in 2013 and $1.9 billion in 2012, primarily due to payments from commercial airplane customers. Discretionary contributions to our pension plans totaled $0.8 billion in 2014 compared with $1.5 billion in 2013 and $1.6 billion in 2012. Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities was $2.5 billion during 2014 compared with $5.2 billion used during 2013 and $3.8 billion used during 2012, largely due to changes in investments in time deposits. Net proceeds from investments were $4.8 billion in 2014 compared with net contributions to investments of $2.9 billion in 2013 and $2 billion in 2012. In 2014, capital expenditures totaled $2.2 billion, up from $2.1 billion in 2013 and $1.7 billion in 2012. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in 2015 than 2014 due to continued investment to support growth.38Table of ContentsFinancing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $8.6 billion during 2014, an increase of $4.3 billion compared with 2013 primarily due to higher share repurchases of $3.2 billion, higher dividends paid of $0.6 billion and a decrease in proceeds from stock options exercised of $0.8 billion in 2014, partially offset by higher new borrowings of $0.4 billion in 2014. Cash used by financing activities was $4.2 billion during 2013, an increase of $0.8 billion compared with 2012 primarily due to share repurchases of $2.8 billion in 2013 partially offset by higher new borrowings of $0.5 billion, lower debt repayments of $0.6 billion and an increase in stock options exercised of $1.0 billion in 2013.During 2014, we issued unsecured debt totaling $0.8 billion, of which $0.5 billion was used to fund the BCC segment, and we repaid $1.4 billion of unsecured debt, including repayments of $0.7 billion of debt held at BCC. At December 31, 2014 and 2013 the recorded balance of debt was $9.1 billion and $9.6 billion of which $0.9 billion and $1.6 billion was classified as short-term. This includes $2.4 billion and $2.6 billion of debt attributable to BCC, of which $0.1 billion and $0.7 billion was classified as short-term at December 31, 2014 and 2013.During 2014 and 2013 we repurchased 46.6 million and 25.4 million shares totaling $6.0 billion and $2.8 billion through our open market share repurchase program. In 2014 and 2013, we had 0.7 million and 0.8 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2014, the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 15, 2014, totaled $12 billion.Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2014 and at December 31, 2014, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $5.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs.Financing commitments totaled $16.7 billion and $18.0 billion at December 31, 2014 and 2013. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required.In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities.At December 31, 2014 and 2013, our pension plans were $17.3 billion and $10.5 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. The increase in the liability primarily reflects the decrease in the discount rate used from 4.80% at December 31, 2013 to 3.90% at December 31, 2014. See Note 14. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2014 with minimal required contributions in 2015. We do not expect the contributions to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans to be significant in 2015. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.At December 31, 2014, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation 39Table of Contentson consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2014, and the estimated timing thereof.(Dollars in millions)Total Lessthan 1year 1-3years 3-5years After 5yearsLong-term debt (including current portion)$8,950 $870 $1,356 $1,871 $4,853Interest on debt(1)5,387 431 800 729 3,427Pension and other postretirement cash requirements10,965 477 1,080 1,972 7,436Capital lease obligations169 67 73 17 12Operating lease obligations1,503 226 386 271 620Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position131,549 47,249 37,187 20,505 26,608Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position16,872 15,959 891 5 17Total contractual obligations$175,395 $65,279 $41,773 $25,370 $42,973(1) Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2014. Variable rate debt was 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2014.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Approximately 4% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts.Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.40Table of ContentsPurchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2014, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2014, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $17.8 billion that extend through 2030. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2014, our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $406 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. Our income tax matters are excluded from the table above. See Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Commercial CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2014.(Dollars in millions)Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3years 4-5years After 5yearsStandby letters of credit and surety bonds$3,985 $2,277 $1,658 $1 $49Commercial aircraft financing commitments16,723 2,552 7,207 4,043 2,921Total commercial commitments$20,708 $4,829 $8,865 $4,044 $2,970Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Contingent ObligationsWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.41Table of ContentsEnvironmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $601 million at December 31, 2014. For additional information, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Income Taxes We have $1,312 million of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2014 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-GAAP MeasuresCore Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per ShareOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expenses which represent costs not attributable to business segments - see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP MeasuresThe table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share.

Disclosure is required even if the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. We have disclosed such activities in our Form 10-Q reports for the second and third quarter of 2014 and those disclosures are incorporated herein by reference. During the fourth quarter of 2014, we sold aeronautical navigation charts and data services to Iran Air. These sales were authorized by a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). Boeing applied for the OFAC license consistent with guidance from the U.S. government in connection with ongoing negotiations between the “P5+1” nations and Iran related to, among other things, the safety of Iran’s civil aviation industry. We generated approximately $190 thousand in gross revenues and $15 thousand net profits during the fourth quarter of 2014 from these sales. We may engage in additional sales pursuant to this license, which sales may require additional disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Act.Critical Accounting PoliciesContract AccountingContract accounting is used to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit predominantly by our BDS business. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ending December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by $100 million, $242 million and $379 million, respectively.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2014 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $309 million. In addition, 43Table of Contentsa number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.Program AccountingProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower initial margins than established programs.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2014 had been estimated to be lower by 1%, it would have increased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $520 million. If the combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2014 (excluding the 747 and 787 programs which had gross margins that were breakeven or near breakeven during 2014) had been estimated to be higher by 1%, it would have decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $360 million. If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if we are required to change one or more of our pricing, cost or other assumptions related to these programs, we could be required to record reach-forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results.44Table of ContentsGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible ImpairmentsWe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2014 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2014, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had $490 million and $497 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets.Pension PlansThe majority of our employees are earning benefits under defined benefit pension plans through 2016. In 2014, we announced changes to our retirement plans whereby nonunion and the majority of union employees currently participating in defined benefit pension plans will transition in 2016 to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.45Table of ContentsThe following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2014.(Dollars in millions)Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bpsPension plans Projected benefit obligation($2,449) $3,068Net periodic pension cost(266) 329Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2014 net periodic pension expense by $141 million. We expect 2015 net periodic pension cost to increase by approximately $367 million and the portion recognized in earnings to decrease by approximately $1,084 million primarily due to amortization of actuarial losses.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate RiskWe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2014, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2014, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $237 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.46Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:51.842773
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2016,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations and Financial ConditionOverviewWe are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in many countries and rely on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security (BDS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Commercial Airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits us as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets sometimes offset. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.Consolidated Results of Operations Earnings From Operations and Core Operating Earnings (Non-GAAP) The following table summarizes key indicators of consolidated results of operations:(Dollars in millions, except per share data) Years ended December 31,2015 2014 2013Revenues$96,114 $90,762 $86,623 GAAP Earnings from operations7,443 7,473 6,562Operating margins7.7% 8.2% 7.6%Effective income tax rate27.7% 23.7% 26.4%Net earnings$5,176 $5,446 $4,585Diluted earnings per share$7.44 $7.38 $5.96 Non-GAAP (1) Core operating earnings$7,741 $8,860 $7,876Core operating margin8.1% 9.8% 9.1%Core earnings per share$7.72 $8.60 $7.07(1)These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense.

Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $6,058 million or 10% due to higher new airplane deliveries and mix. BDS revenues decreased by $493 million or 2% due to lower revenues in all three segments. Revenues in 2014 increased by $4,139 million or 5% compared with 2013. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $7,009 million primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries. BDS revenues decreased by $2,316 million due to lower revenues in all three segments. The changes in unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2015, 2014 and 2013 primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries. Earnings From Operations The following table summarizes Earnings from operations:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2015 2014 2013Commercial Airplanes$5,157 $6,411 $5,795Defense, Space & Security3,274 3,133 3,235Boeing Capital50 92 107Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense (298) (1,387) (1,314)Other unallocated items and eliminations(740) (776) (1,261)Earnings from operations (GAAP)$7,443 $7,473 $6,562Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense298 1,387 1,314Core operating earnings (Non-GAAP)$7,741 $8,860 $7,876Earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $30 million compared with 2014 primarily reflecting a fourth quarter charge of $885 million related to the 747 program at Commercial Airplanes and higher charges of $410 million related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker recorded by Commercial Airplanes and our Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) segment, partially offset by lower unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense of $1,089 million.Earnings from operations in 2014 increased by $911 million compared with 2013 primarily reflecting higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes of $616 million and lower unallocated items and eliminations of $485 million. The decrease in unallocated items is due to the A-12 litigation settlement of $406 million which was recorded in 2013 and lower 2014 deferred compensation of $194 million. The A-12 aircraft litigation settlement resulted in the Company recording a $406 million pre-tax charge in 2013, which consisted of writing-off A-12 inventory, recorded as cost of sales, and providing three EA-18G Growlers at no cost to the U.S. Navy, recorded as a reduction in revenues.20Table of ContentsDuring the second quarter of 2015 and of 2014, we recorded reach-forward losses of $835 million and $425 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract. $513 million of the 2015 charge was recorded at Commercial Airplanes and $322 million at our BMA segment. $238 million of the 2014 charge was recorded at Commercial Airplanes and $187 million at our BMA segment.Core operating earnings in 2015 decreased by $1,119 million compared with 2014 primarily due to the 2015 747 charge and higher USAF KC-46A Tanker charges. Core operating earnings in 2014 increased by $984 million compared with 2013 primarily reflecting higher earnings at Commercial Airplanes and the 2013 A-12 charge.Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2015 2014 2013Share-based plans($76) ($67) ($95)Deferred compensation(63) (44) (238)Eliminations and other(601) (665) (522)Litigation settlements (406)Sub-total (included in core operating earnings*)(740) (776) (1,261)Pension(421) (1,469) (1,374)Postretirement123 82 60Pension and other postretirement benefit expense (excluded from core operating earnings*)(298) (1,387) (1,314)Total unallocated items, eliminations and other($1,038) ($2,163) ($2,575)* Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See page 43.Deferred compensation expense increased by $19 million in 2015 and decreased by $194 million in 2014, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price.Eliminations and other unallocated expense decreased by $64 million in 2015 primarily due to the timing of the elimination of profit on intercompany aircraft deliveries and expense allocations. The increase of $143 million in 2014 was primarily due to insurance recoveries which were recorded in the third quarter of 2013.Litigation settlements include the 2013 charge of $406 million related to the settlement of the A-12 litigation.21Table of ContentsNet periodic benefit cost related to pension totaled $2,786 million, $2,208 million and $3,449 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The components of net periodic benefit cost are shown in the following table: PensionYears ended December 31,2015 2014 2013Service cost$1,764 $1,661 $1,886Interest cost2,990 3,058 2,906Expected return on plan assets(4,031) (4,169) (3,874)Amortization of prior service costs196 177 196Recognized net actuarial loss1,577 1,020 2,231Settlement/curtailment/other losses290 461 104Net periodic benefit cost$2,786 $2,208 $3,449The increase in 2015 net periodic benefit cost related to pension is primarily due to $557 million of higher amortization of actuarial losses due to lower discount rates. The decrease in 2014 is primarily due to lower amortization of actuarial losses due to higher discount rates which more than offset higher 2014 curtailment charges.A portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods. Costs are allocated to the business segments as described in Note 21.Net periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows:(Dollars in millions)PensionYears ended December 31,2015 2014 2013Allocated to business segments($1,945) ($1,746) ($1,662)Unallocated items, eliminations and other(421) (1,469) (1,374)Total($2,366) ($3,215) ($3,036)Unallocated pension expense recognized in earnings decreased by $1,048 million in 2015 primarily due to lower amortization of pension costs capitalized as inventory in prior years and lower curtailment charges in 2015. Unallocated pension expense in 2014 reflects pension charges of $395 million, primarily for pension curtailment costs.

Interest and debt expense decreased by $53 million in 2014 as a result of lower weighted average debt balances.Our effective income tax rates were 27.7%, 23.7% and 26.4% for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Our 2015 effective tax rate was higher than 2014 primarily due to tax benefits of $524 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to tax basis adjustments and settlement of the 2007 - 2010 federal tax audits. Our 2014 effective tax rate was lower than 2013 primarily due to the tax benefits of $524 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales and BDS predominantly uses contract accounting. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. Under contract accounting, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. The following table summarizes cost of sales:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2015 2014Change 2014 2013ChangeCost of sales$82,088 $76,752$5,336 $76,752 $73,268$3,484Cost of sales as a % of revenues85.4% 84.6%0.8% 84.6% 84.6%0.0%Cost of sales in 2015 increased by $5,336 million, or 7%, compared with the same period in 2014, primarily driven by the $5,352 million, or 6%, increase in revenues. Cost of sales at Commercial Airplanes increased by $6,846 million, or 14%, primarily driven by the 10% increase in revenues. Cost of sales at BDS decreased by $252 million, or 1%, primarily due to the 2% reduction in revenues. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was approximately 85.4% in 2015 compared with 84.6% in 2014 primarily driven by the 2015 747 charge and higher KC-46A Tanker charges. Cost of sales in 2014 increased by $3,484 million, or 5%, compared with the same period in 2013, primarily driven by the increase in revenue. Cost of sales at Commercial Airplanes increased by $6,265 million, or 14%, primarily driven by the 13% increase in revenues. Cost of sales at BDS decreased by $2,085 million, or 8%, primarily due to the 7% reduction in revenues.Research and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2015 2014 2013Commercial Airplanes$2,340 $1,881 $1,807Defense, Space & Security986 1,158 1,215Other5 8 49Total$3,331 $3,047 $3,07123Table of ContentsResearch and development expense in 2015 increased by $284 million compared to 2014 primarily due to higher 777X spending at Commercial Airplanes which more than offset lower spending at BDS. Research and development expense in 2014 decreased by $24 million compared to 2013. In 2014, Commercial Airplanes spending increased on 777X, 787-10 and 737 MAX, partially offset by lower spending on the 787-9. BacklogOur backlog at December 31 was as follows:(Dollars in millions)2015 2014 2013Contractual Backlog: Commercial Airplanes$431,408 $440,118 $372,980Defense, Space & Security: Boeing Military Aircraft20,019 21,119 23,580Network & Space Systems7,368 8,935 9,832Global Services & Support17,800 16,920 16,269Total Defense, Space & Security45,187 46,974 49,681Total contractual backlog$476,595 $487,092 $422,661Unobligated backlog$12,704 $15,299 $18,267Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog at December 31, 2015 compared with December 31, 2014 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. The increase in contractual backlog at December 31, 2014 compared with December 31, 2013 was primarily due to commercial airplane orders and reclassifications from unobligated backlog related to incremental funding. The increase was partially offset by commercial airplane deliveries and revenues recognized on awarded contracts.Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The decreases in unobligated backlog in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to reclassifications to contractual backlog related to incremental funding for BDS contracts, partially offset by contract awards. Additional ConsiderationsKC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. We have also begun work on low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft for the USAF. The USAF is expected to authorize two low rate initial production lots in 2016 for a total of 19 aircraft, subject to satisfactory progress being made on the EMD contract.In second quarter 2014, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $425 million on the EMD contract. In second quarter 2015, we recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $835 million. $513 million of this loss was recorded at our Commercial Airplanes segment and the remaining $322 million was recorded in our BMA segment. The $835 million loss includes $670 million related to the EMD contract and $165 million related to LRIP aircraft. The reach-forward loss on the EMD contract was driven primarily by design changes required in the aircraft fuels and aerial refueling systems which were identified as we prepared for and conducted ground and flight testing. Other costs include additional qualification and certification testing as well as investments that will enable us to meet our delivery commitments in 2017. The reach-forward 24Table of Contentsloss related to LRIP aircraft was primarily driven by increased manufacturing complexity resulting from design changes. As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience technical or quality issues, schedule delays or increased costs. We continue to expect to meet our commitment to deliver 18 fully operational aircraft to the customer by August 2017. The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft and full rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. Russia/Ukraine We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted.Export-Import Bank of the United States Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the bank’s board of directors and assist with alternative third party financing sources. Segment Results of Operations and Financial ConditionCommercial AirplanesBusiness Environment and TrendsAirline Industry Environment Global economic activity and global trade, which are the primary drivers of the demand for air travel, grew below the long-term average for the fourth year in a row in 2015. Despite this, passenger traffic continued to grow more than 5%, as it has every year since 2010, and accelerated to more than 6% in 2015. While growth was strong across all major world regions, there continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models. Airlines operating in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions as well as low-cost-carriers globally are currently leading passenger growth. Air cargo traffic grew at 5% in the first quarter and 3% in the second quarter of 2015 compared with the same periods in 2014. However, weaker global industrial production and world trade resulted in little to no cargo traffic growth during the remainder of the year. The slowing air cargo market recovery has resulted in reduced orders and demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions, and in January 2016, we announced plans to further reduce production rates on the 747 program. Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes and in 2015 benefited significantly from lower fuel costs. Net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to total $33 billion in 2015 compared to $17 billion in 2014. We expect airline profits to continue to grow in 2016, driven by strong passenger demand and relatively low oil prices.25Table of ContentsThe long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.9% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 3.1% average annual GDP growth, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $5.6 trillion market for approximately 38,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years.The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations.Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 11% of Commercial Airplanes’ contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines, including cargo carriers. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and increasingly capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above 90 seats. Many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors’ revenues and profits. Many competitors are expected to benefit from the strong U.S. dollar experienced in 2015 and ongoing improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share through pricing and/or improving earnings.We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spare parts, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively. 26Table of ContentsResults of Operations(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2015 2014 2013Revenues$66,048 $59,990 $52,981% of total company revenues69% 66% 61%Earnings from operations$5,157 $6,411 $5,795Operating margins7.8% 10.7% 10.9%Research and development$2,340 $1,881 $1,807Contractual backlog$431,408 $440,118 $372,980Unobligated backlog$216 $360 $660Revenues Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $6,058 million or 10% in 2015 compared with 2014 and by $7,009 million or 13% in 2014 compared with 2013 primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries and mix.Commercial Airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: 737*747†767 777 787†Total2015 Cumulative deliveries5,713 1,519 1,083 1,361 363 Deliveries495(15) 18(3) 16 98 135 7622014 Cumulative deliveries5,218 1,501 1,067 1,263 228 Deliveries485(15) 19(3) 6 99 114 7232013 Cumulative deliveries4,733 1,482 1,061 1,164 114 Deliveries440(8) 24 21 98 65(1) 648* Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses†Aircraft accounted for as revenues by Commercial Airplanes and as operating leases in consolidation identified by parenthesesEarnings From Operations Earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $1,254 million or 20% compared with 2014 primarily due to higher reach-forward losses of $1,160 million and higher research and development spending of $459 million, largely on the 777X, which more than offset higher new airplane deliveries and mix. During the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a charge of $885 million to recognize a reach-forward loss on the 747 program. In addition, we recorded reach-forward losses on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract of $513 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $238 million in the second quarter of 2014. Operating margins in 2015 decreased primarily due to additional reach-forward losses, higher research and development expense and the dilutive impact of 787 volume and mix.Earnings from operations in 2014 increased by $616 million or 11% compared with 2013. The increase in earnings is primarily due to higher earnings of $947 million driven by higher new airplane deliveries and commercial aviation services revenue growth. This earnings increase was partially offset by a reach-27Table of Contentsforward loss of $238 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and higher research and development expense of $74 million. The increase in research and development reflects higher spending on the 777X, 787-10 and 737 MAX, which more than offset lower 787-9 spending. Operating margins decreased from 10.9% in 2013 to 10.7% in 2014 primarily due to the dilutive impact of 747 and 787 deliveries and the USAF KC-46A Tanker reach-forward loss.Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers.The decrease in contractual backlog during 2015 was due to deliveries in excess of net orders. The increase in contractual backlog during 2014 was due to net orders in excess of deliveries. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the reclassification from unobligated to contractual backlog related to incremental funding of the existing multi-year contract for Commercial Airplanes’ share of the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract.Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.28Table of ContentsThe following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31.

Program Highlights737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 600 units during 2015 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 42 per month and plan an additional increase to 47 per month in 2017. We plan to further increase the rate to 52 per month in 2018 and to 57 per month in 2019. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017.747 Program Lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic have resulted in market uncertainties, ongoing pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. During the second half of 2015, the cargo market recovery slowed, and in January 2016, we announced a plan to further reduce the production rate to 0.5 per month as well as recognize a reach-forward loss of $885 million on the program. The charge, which was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015, is primarily related to lower anticipated revenues reflecting ongoing pricing and market pressures, as well as higher estimated costs due to the reduced production rate. We are currently producing at a rate of 1.3 per month with plans to reduce the rate to 1.0 per month in March 2016, further reduce the rate to 0.5 per month in September 2016 and then return to 1.0 per month in 2019. We have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold production positions and we remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders in 2016 and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face an additional reach-forward loss that may be material.767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 34 units during 2015 due to the program's progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. We are currently producing at a combined tanker and 29Table of Contentscommercial production rate of 1.5 per month and plan to increase to 2 per month in 2016. We plan to further increase the rate to 2.5 per month in the fourth quarter of 2017. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2015 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 8.3 per month and plan to reduce the rate to 7 per month in 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. 787 Program We continue to produce at a rate of 10 per month and plan for rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month by the end of the decade. First delivery of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018. The accounting quantity of 1,300 units remains unchanged. We remain focused on increasing the production rate to 12 per month in 2016 and improving productivity. We continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly for both the 787-8 and 787-9, including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, as well as completing and delivering early build aircraft. In addition, we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes, including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions. During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense. Based on sales activity and market interest we continue to believe that the remaining 787 flight-test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to these aircraft in program inventory. However, there is risk that we may be unable to sell these aircraft. If we determine that any of the remaining flight-test aircraft cannot be sold, we would incur additional material charges related to the reclassification of costs associated with those aircraft to research and development expense.The combination of production challenges, change incorporation on early build aircraft, schedule delays, customer and supplier impacts and changes to price escalation factors has created significant pressure on program profitability and we continue to have near breakeven gross margins. If risks related to these challenges, together with risks associated with planned production rate increases, or introducing or manufacturing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks.Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services.30Table of ContentsProgram Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.Reflects models in development during 2015We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013.Additional ConsiderationsThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.Defense, Space & SecurityBusiness Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment Overview The enactment of The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 in November 2015 established overall defense spending levels for FY2016 and FY2017. However, uncertainty remains with respect to levels of defense spending for FY2018 and beyond, including risk of future sequestration cuts. Significant uncertainty also continues with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorization and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows. In addition to the risks described above, if Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to 31Table of Contentsfurlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of international opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats.

In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, including remanufactures and modifications, were as follows:Years ended December 31,2015 2014 2013F/A-18 Models35 44 48F-15 Models12 14 14C-17 Globemaster III5 7 10CH-47 Chinook (New)41 54 44CH-47 Chinook (Renewed)16 14AH-64 Apache (New)23 45 37AH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)38 37 45P-8 Models14 11 11AEW&C1 3 C-40A11 Total186 216 22332Table of ContentsRevenues BDS revenues in 2015 decreased by $493 million compared with 2014 due to lower revenues in all three segments. BDS revenues in 2014 decreased by $2,316 million compared with 2013 primarily due to lower revenues of $1,775 million in the BMA segment and lower revenues of $509 million in the Network & Space Systems (N&SS) segment. Earnings From Operations BDS earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $141 million compared with 2014 due to higher earnings in all three segments. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $49 million lower in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily reflecting higher charges of $135 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract recorded at BMA which more than offset higher favorable adjustments in the Global Services & Support (GS&S) segment.BDS earnings from operations in 2014 decreased by $102 million compared with 2013 due to lower earnings of $200 million and $21 million in the BMA and N&SS segments, partially offset by higher earnings of $119 million in the GS&S segment. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $96 million higher in 2014 compared with 2013, primarily reflecting higher favorable adjustments in the GS&S segment.BacklogTotal backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog was $57,675 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting a decrease of 7% from December 31, 2014. BDS total backlog was $61,913 million at December 31, 2014, reflecting a decrease of 8% from December 31, 2013. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional ConsiderationsOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Proprietary and Space Launch System (SLS) programs.Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew and commercial and military satellites.33Table of ContentsBoeing Military Aircraft Results of Operations(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2015 2014 2013Revenues$13,482 $13,500 $15,275% of total company revenues14% 15% 18%Earnings from operations$1,318 $1,301 $1,501Operating margins9.8% 9.6% 9.8%Contractual backlog$20,019 $21,119 $23,580Unobligated backlog$7,151 $8,020 $10,064Revenues BMA revenues in 2015 decreased by $18 million compared with 2014 primarily due to lower revenues of $1,083 million from fewer deliveries and mix on the F/A-18, Apache and V-22 programs, partially offset by higher revenues related to a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015 on the F-15 program due to contract negotiations and higher milestone revenue on the USAF KC-46A Tanker program. BMA revenues in 2014 decreased by $1,775 million, or 12%, compared with 2013 primarily due to a reduction of revenue of $1,730 million related to F-15 and USAF KC-46A Tanker milestones, fewer C-17 aircraft deliveries and delivery mix on the P-8 program.Earnings From Operations BMA earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $17 million compared with 2014 primarily due to lower C-17 charges, higher Chinook deliveries and higher earnings on the F-15 program, primarily due to a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015. These increases were partially offset by higher charges of $135 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and lower earnings on proprietary programs. BMA recorded charges of $322 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $187 million in the second quarter of 2014 related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract. In addition, BMA recorded a charge of $48 million in the first quarter of 2014 to write-off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of our decision to produce three fewer C-17 aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $96 million lower in 2015 than in 2014 primarily driven by the USAF KC-46A Tanker charges and lower favorable F/A-18 adjustments, partially offset by higher favorable F-15 program adjustments.BMA earnings from operations in 2014 decreased by $200 million, or 13%, compared with 2013 primarily due to 2014 charges of $235 million and lower earnings of $73 million related to fewer deliveries on the C-17 program. The charges recorded in 2014 included $187 million related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and $48 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of our 2014 decision to produce three fewer C-17 aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These decreases were partially offset by higher earnings of $65 million related to improved performance on the F/A-18 program. In addition, in 2013, we recorded a charge of $64 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of the Republic of Korea's announcement to restart its F-X fighter aircraft competition. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $39 million lower in 2014 than in 2013 primarily driven by the reach-forward loss on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract, partially offset by higher favorable adjustments to the F/A-18 and F-15 programs.34Table of ContentsBacklogBMA total backlog at December 31, 2015 was $27,170 million, a decrease of 7% reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by contract awards for the F-15, Apache, C-17 and F/A-18 programs. BMA total backlog at December 31, 2014 was $29,139 million, a decrease of 13% reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by contract awards for the F/A-18, P-8 and Apache programs.Additional ConsiderationsC-17 and F/A-18 See the discussion of the C-17 and F/A-18 programs in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.USAF KC-46A Tanker See the discussion of the USAF KC-46A Tanker program on pages 24 – 25.

These decreases were partially offset by higher Aircraft Modernization & Sustainment (AM&S) revenues of $245 million primarily related to deliveries of three AEW&C Peace Eagle to Turkey in 2014.Earnings From Operations GS&S earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $96 million compared with 2014 primarily due to improved performance across the segment. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $57 million higher in 2015 than in 2014 primarily due to favorable F-15 program adjustments. GS&S earnings from operations in 2014 increased by $119 million, or 12%, compared with 2013 primarily due to an increase of $145 million related to improved performance in several MM&U programs, most notably the AEW&C Peace Eagle contract. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $123 million higher in 2014 than in 2013 primarily due to unfavorable adjustments on the AEW&C Peace Eagle contract in 2013. BacklogGS&S total backlog at December 31, 2015 was $18,158 million, an increase of 2% reflecting current year contract awards, including C-17 support programs, Advanced Surveillance Command and Control and F-15 support programs, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years. GS&S total backlog at December 31, 2014 was $17,852 million, which was largely unchanged from backlog of $17,736 million at December 31, 2013. Boeing CapitalBusiness Environment and TrendsBCC’s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2015 totaled $3,459 million. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is concentrated among certain U.S. commercial airline customers. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8F aircraft.BCC provided customer financing of $586 million and $489 million during 2015 and 2014. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2016, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources.Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,300 western-built commercial jet aircraft (9.5% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2015, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 11% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2014 and 2013, 9.8% and 9.2% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.37Table of ContentsResults of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2015 2014 2013Revenues$413 $416 $408Earnings from operations$50 $92 $107Operating margins12% 22% 26%Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2015 are consistent with 2014. BCC’s revenues in 2014 increased by $8 million compared with 2013 primarily due to higher aircraft return condition payments of $60 million, partially offset by a decrease in finance lease income and lower interest income.Earnings From Operations BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $42 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher asset impairment expense. Earnings from operations in 2014 decreased by $15 million compared with 2013 due to $60 million increase in asset impairment expense, partially offset by a reduction in the provision for losses on receivables, driven by a change to a customer credit rating recorded in the first quarter of 2014, in addition to lower depreciation and interest expense.Financial PositionThe following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31:(Dollars in millions)2015 2014Customer financing and investment portfolio, net$3,449 $3,493Other assets, primarily cash and short-term investments480 615Total assets$3,929 $4,108 Other liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes$1,099 $1,212Debt, including intercompany loans2,355 2,412Equity475 484Total liabilities and equity$3,929 $4,108 Debt-to-equity ratio5.0-to-1 5.0-to-1BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2015 decreased from December 31, 2014 primarily due to normal portfolio run-off, impairments and dispositions, partially offset by the increased volume of $586 million.

Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $111 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2016. We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended.38Table of ContentsBCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow Summary(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2015 2014 2013Net earnings$5,176 $5,446 $4,585Non-cash items2,392 2,515 2,516Changes in working capital1,795 897 1,078Net cash provided by operating activities9,363 8,858 8,179Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities(1,846) 2,467 (5,154)Net cash used by financing activities(7,920) (8,593) (4,249)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(28) (87) (29)Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents(431) 2,645 (1,253)Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year11,733 9,088 10,341Cash and cash equivalents at end of period$11,302 $11,733 $9,088Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.4 billion during 2015, compared with $8.9 billion during 2014 and $8.2 billion in 2013. The increase of $0.5 billion in 2015 was primarily due to lower inventory growth, partially offset by lower receipts of advances and progress billings. The increase of $0.7 billion in 2014 was primarily due to higher customer advances which more than offset higher gross inventory. Our investment in gross inventories decreased by $0.3 billion in 2015 primarily in our BDS business, largely driven by ending production of C-17 aircraft, which more than offset continued investment in commercial airplane program inventory. Our investment in gross inventories increased $7.6 billion in 2014 and $5.7 billion in 2013, largely driven by continued investment in commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787 inventory. Advances and progress billings increased by $0.4 billion in 2015, $6.9 billion in 2014 and $3.9 billion in 2013, primarily due to payments from Commercial Airplane customers. Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were insignificant in 2015 compared with $0.8 billion in 2014 and $1.5 billion in 2013. Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities was $1.8 billion during 2015 compared with $2.5 billion provided during 2014 and $5.2 billion used during 2013, largely due to changes in investments in time deposits. Net proceeds from investments were $0.6 billion in 2015 compared with $4.8 billion in 2014 and net contributions to investments of $2.9 billion in 2013. In 2015, capital expenditures totaled $2.5 billion, up from $2.2 billion in 2014 and $2.1 billion in 2013. We expect capital expenditures in 2016 to be consistent with 2015 due to continued investment to support growth.Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $7.9 billion during 2015, a decrease of $0.7 billion compared with 2014 primarily due to higher new borrowings of $0.8 billion and lower repayments of debt and distribution rights of $0.9 billion in 2015, which more than offset higher share repurchases of $0.8 billion and higher dividend payments of $0.4 billion in 2015. Cash used by financing activities was $8.6 billion during 2014, an increase of $4.3 billion compared with 2013 primarily due to higher share repurchases of $3.2 billion, higher dividends paid of $0.6 billion and a decrease in proceeds from stock options exercised of $0.8 billion in 2014, partially offset by higher new borrowings of $0.4 billion in 2014. 39Table of ContentsDuring 2015, we issued $1.7 billion and repaid $0.9 billion of debt. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 the recorded balance of debt was $10.0 billion and $9.1 billion of which $1.2 billion and $0.9 billion was classified as short-term. At December 31, 2015 and 2014 this includes $2.4 billion of debt attributable to BCC, of which $0.5 billion and $0.1 billion was classified as short-term.During 2015 and 2014 we repurchased 46.7 million and 46.6 million shares totaling $6.8 billion and $6.0 billion through our open market share repurchase program. In 2015 and 2014, we had 0.7 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2015, the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 14, 2015, totaled $14 billion.Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2015 and at December 31, 2015, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $5.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs.Financing commitments totaled $16.3 billion and $16.7 billion at December 31, 2015 and 2014. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers.In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities.At December 31, 2015 and 2014, our pension plans were $17.9 billion and $17.3 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2015 with minimal required contributions in 2016. We expect to make contributions to our plans of approximately $0.1 billion in 2016. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.At December 31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.40Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2015, and the estimated timing thereof.(Dollars in millions)Total Lessthan 1year 1-3years 3-5years After 5yearsLong-term debt (including current portion)$9,922 $1,186 $996 $2,358 $5,382Interest on debt(1)5,580 459 849 718 3,554Pension and other postretirement cash requirements14,146 640 1,718 4,222 7,566Capital lease obligations157 55 76 16 10Operating lease obligations1,529 244 405 277 603Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position123,100 43,471 31,741 24,465 23,423Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position16,580 15,358 824 125 273Total contractual obligations (2)$171,014 $61,413 $36,609 $32,181 $40,811(1) Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2015. Variable rate debt was 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2015.(2) Excludes income tax matters. As of December 31, 2015, our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $1,177 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.41Table of ContentsPurchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2015, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2015, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $18.4 billion that extend through 2030. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.Commercial CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2015.(Dollars in millions)Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3years 4-5years After 5yearsStandby letters of credit and surety bonds$4,968 $3,127 $1,355 $182 $304Commercial aircraft financing commitments16,283 2,897 6,899 4,205 2,282Total commercial commitments$21,251 $6,024 $8,254 $4,387 $2,586Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Contingent ObligationsWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $566 million at December 31, 2015. For additional information, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Income Taxes We have $1,617 million of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2015 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.42Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-GAAP MeasuresCore Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per ShareOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of certain pension and other postretirement benefit expenses that are not allocated to business segments - see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP MeasuresThe table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share.

Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2015, net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operations by $224 million. For the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by $100 million and $242 million.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2015 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $304 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.Program AccountingProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.44Table of ContentsFactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segment’s operating margins. For the year-ended December 31, 2015, a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segment would have a $650 million impact on operating earnings. The 747 is in a reach-forward loss position at December 31, 2015 while the 787 program had near breakeven margins during 2015. Absent changes in estimated revenues or costs, subsequent 747 deliveries are recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately as an additional reach-forward loss. If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if we are required to change one or more of our pricing, cost or other assumptions related to these programs, we could be required to record additional reach-forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible ImpairmentsWe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the 45Table of Contentstwo-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2015 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2015, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets.Pension PlansThe majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans will transition to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2015.(Dollars in millions)Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bpsPension plans Projected benefit obligation($2,128) $2,648Net periodic pension cost(129) 152Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2015 net periodic pension expense by $148 million. We expect 2016 net periodic pension cost 46Table of Contentsto decrease by approximately $2,119 million and the portion recognized in earnings to decrease by approximately $378 million primarily due to lower service cost and amortization of actuarial losses.OtherSection 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”), require disclosure of certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran that occurred during the period covered by this report. Disclosure is required even if the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. We have disclosed such activities in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the second quarter of 2015 and such disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. During the fourth quarter of 2015, we agreed to sell aircraft maintenance manuals to Iran Air Tours. We generated no revenues or net profits during the fourth quarter of 2015 from these activities. These sales were authorized by a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). Boeing applied for the OFAC license consistent with guidance from the U.S. government in connection with ongoing negotiations between the “P5+1” nations and Iran related to, among other things, the safety of Iran’s civil aviation industry. We may engage in additional activities pursuant to this license, which sales may require additional disclosure pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Act.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate RiskWe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2015, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2015, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $229 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.47Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:51.362725
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2017,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations and Financial ConditionOverviewWe are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in many countries and rely on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security (BDS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Commercial Airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits us as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets sometimes offset. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.In November 2016, we announced plans for the formation of Boeing Global Services (BGS), which will bring together certain Commercial Aviation Services businesses currently included in the Commercial Airplanes segment and certain BDS businesses (primarily those currently included in the Global Services & Support (GS&S) segment). We expect BGS to be operational during the second half of 2017. 18Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations The following table summarizes key indicators of consolidated results of operations:(Dollars in millions, except per share data) Years ended December 31,2016 2015 2014Revenues$94,571 $96,114 $90,762 GAAP Earnings from operations5,834 7,443 7,473Operating margins6.2% 7.7% 8.2%Effective income tax rate12.1% 27.7% 23.7%Net earnings$4,895 $5,176 $5,446Diluted earnings per share$7.61 $7.44 $7.38 Non-GAAP (1) Core operating earnings$5,464 $7,741 $8,860Core operating margins5.8% 8.1% 9.8%Core earnings per share$7.24 $7.72 $8.60(1)These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense.

Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $979 million or 1% primarily due to lower deliveries. BDS revenues for 2016 decreased by $890 million compared with the same period in 2015 due to lower revenues in Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) and Network & Space Systems (N&SS), partially offset by higher revenues in GS&S. Revenues in 2015 increased by $5,352 million or 6% compared with 2014. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $6,058 million or 10% due to higher new airplane deliveries and mix. BDS revenues decreased by $493 million or 2% primarily due to lower revenues in the GS&S and N&SS segments.The changes in unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2016, 2015 and 2014 primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries. 19Table of ContentsEarnings From Operations The following table summarizes Earnings from operations:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2016 2015 2014Commercial Airplanes$3,130 $5,157 $6,411Defense, Space & Security3,008 3,274 3,133Boeing Capital59 50 92Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit income/(expense) 370 (298) (1,387)Other unallocated items and eliminations(733) (740) (776)Earnings from operations (GAAP)$5,834 $7,443 $7,473Unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit(370) 298 1,387Core operating earnings (Non-GAAP)$5,464 $7,741 $8,860Earnings from operations in 2016 decreased by $1,609 million compared with 2015 due to lower earnings at Commercial Airplanes, partially offset by the change in unallocated pension and postretirement income/(expense). Commercial Airplanes earnings in 2016 decreased by $2,027 million primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft costs to research and development and higher reach-forward losses on the 747 and KC-46A Tanker programs. The reclassification of flight test aircraft costs was recorded in second quarter as a result of our determination that two 787 flight test aircraft were no longer commercially saleable. The change in the unallocated pension and postretirement income/(expense) in 2016 was primarily driven by lower service costs and lower amortization of actuarial losses. Earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $30 million compared with 2014 primarily reflecting a fourth quarter charge of $885 million related to the 747 program at Commercial Airplanes and higher charges of $410 million related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker recorded by Commercial Airplanes and our BMA segment, partially offset by lower unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense of $1,089 million. The 2015 unallocated expense is lower than 2014, primarily due to the lower amortization of pension costs capitalized as inventory in prior years as well as lower settlements and curtailments. During 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program. In 2016, we recorded charges of $1,128 million, of which $772 million was recorded at Commercial Airplanes and $356 million at our BMA segment. During 2015, we recorded charges of $835 million: $513 million at Commercial Airplanes and $322 million at our BMA segment. During 2014, we recorded charges of $425 million: $238 million at Commercial Airplanes and $187 million at our BMA segment. During 2016 and 2015 we recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million and $885 million.Core operating earnings for 2016 decreased by $2,277 million compared with 2015 primarily due to the reclassification of costs related to the 787 flight test aircraft and higher charges on the 747 and KC-46A Tanker programs described above. Core operating earnings in 2015 decreased by $1,119 million compared with 2014 primarily due to the 2015 747 charge and higher KC-46A Tanker charges. 20Table of ContentsUnallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2016 2015 2014Share-based plans($66) ($76) ($67)Deferred compensation(46) (63) (44)Eliminations and other(621) (601) (665)Sub-total (included in core operating earnings*)(733) (740) (776)Pension217 (421) (1,469)Postretirement153 123 82Pension and other postretirement benefit income/(expense)(excluded from core operating earnings*)370 (298) (1,387)Total unallocated items, eliminations and other($363) ($1,038) ($2,163)* Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense. See pages 42 - 43.Deferred compensation expense decreased by $17 million in 2016 and increased by $19 million in 2015, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price.Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $20 million in 2016 and decreased by $64 million in 2015 primarily due to the timing of the elimination of profit on intercompany aircraft deliveries and expense allocations. Net periodic benefit cost related to pension totaled $523 million, $2,786 million and $2,208 million in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The components of net periodic benefit cost are shown in the following table: PensionYears ended December 31,2016 2015 2014Service cost$604 $1,764 $1,661Interest cost3,050 2,990 3,058Expected return on plan assets(3,999) (4,031) (4,169)Amortization of prior service costs38 196 177Recognized net actuarial loss790 1,577 1,020Settlement/curtailment/other losses40 290 461Net periodic benefit cost$523 $2,786 $2,208The decrease in net periodic pension benefit cost of $2,263 million in 2016 is primarily due to lower service costs and lower amortization of actuarial losses. The lower service costs reflect the changes to our retirement plans whereby certain employees transitioned in 2016 to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan. The lower amortization of actuarial losses reflects actuarial gains in 2015 resulting from the year-end discount rate increase from 3.9% to 4.2%. The increase in 2015 net periodic benefit cost related to pension is primarily due to $557 million of higher amortization of actuarial losses in 2015 resulting from the 2014 year-end discount rate decrease from 4.8% to 3.9%.A portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods. Costs are allocated to the business segments as described in Note 21.21Table of ContentsNet periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows:(Dollars in millions)PensionYears ended December 31,2016 2015 2014Allocated to business segments($2,196) ($1,945) ($1,746)Unallocated items, eliminations and other217 (421) (1,469)Total($1,979) ($2,366) ($3,215)The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings in 2016 was a benefit of $217 million compared with expense of $421 million in 2015. The 2016 benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period. Unallocated pension expense recognized in earnings decreased by $1,048 million in 2015 primarily due to lower amortization of pension costs capitalized as inventory in prior years and lower curtailment charges in 2015.Other Earnings Items(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2016 2015 2014Earnings from operations$5,834 $7,443 $7,473Other income/(loss), net40 (13) (3)Interest and debt expense(306) (275) (333)Earnings before income taxes5,568 7,155 7,137Income tax expense(673) (1,979) (1,691)Net earnings from continuing operations$4,895 $5,176 $5,446Interest and debt expense increased by $31 million in 2016 as a result of higher average debt balances.Our effective income tax rates were 12.1%, 27.7% and 23.7% for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. Our 2016 effective tax rate was lower than 2015 primarily due to tax benefits of $617 million recorded in the third quarter of 2016 related to tax basis adjustments and settlement of the 2011 - 2012 federal tax audits. Our 2015 effective tax rate was higher than 2014 primarily due to tax benefits of $524 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to tax basis adjustments and settlement of the 2007-2010 federal tax audits. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales and BDS predominantly uses contract accounting. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. Under contract accounting, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. 22Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes cost of sales:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2016 2015Change 2015 2014ChangeCost of sales$80,790 $82,088($1,298) $82,088 $76,752$5,336Cost of sales as a % of revenues85.4% 85.4%0.0% 85.4% 84.6%0.8%Cost of sales in 2016 decreased by $1,298 million, or 2%, compared with 2015, primarily due to lower volume across all segments, partially offset by the 747 reach-forward losses at Commercial Airplanes. Cost of sales in 2015 increased by $5,336 million, or 7%, compared with 2014, primarily driven by the $5,352 million, or 6%, increase in revenues. Cost of sales at Commercial Airplanes increased by $6,846 million, or 14%, primarily driven by the 10% increase in revenues. Cost of sales at BDS decreased by $252 million, or 1%, primarily due to the 2% reduction in revenues. Cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was approximately 85.4% in 2015 compared with 84.6% in 2014 primarily driven by the 2015 747 charge and higher KC-46A Tanker charges. Research and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2016 2015 2014Commercial Airplanes$3,755 $2,340 $1,881Defense, Space & Security919 986 1,158Other(47) 5 8Total$4,627 $3,331 $3,047Research and development expense in 2016 increased by $1,296 million compared with 2015 primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of costs from inventory in the second quarter of 2016 related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher spending on 777X at Commercial Airplanes. Research and development expense in 2015 increased by $284 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher 777X spending at Commercial Airplanes which more than offset lower spending at BDS. BacklogOur backlog at December 31 was as follows:(Dollars in millions)2016 2015 2014Contractual Backlog: Commercial Airplanes$416,198 $431,408 $440,118Defense, Space & Security: Boeing Military Aircraft21,415 19,947 21,078Network & Space Systems5,054 7,368 8,935Global Services & Support15,610 17,872 16,961Total Defense, Space & Security42,079 45,187 46,974Total contractual backlog$458,277 $476,595 $487,092Unobligated backlog$15,215 $12,704 $15,29923Table of ContentsContractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2016 and 2015 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The increase in unobligated backlog in 2016 was primarily due to contract awards, partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS contracts. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2015 was primarily due to reclassifications to contractual backlog related to incremental funding for BDS contracts, partially offset by contract awards. Additional ConsiderationsKC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. The EMD contract is currently in the certification and flight testing phases. In 2015, we began work on low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft for the USAF. During the third quarter of 2016, following our achievement of key flight testing milestones, the USAF authorized two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion. On January 27, 2017, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1 billion.Through 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,260 million related to the EMD contract and LRIP aircraft. During 2016 we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,128 million. In the first quarter of 2016, we recorded charges of $243 million which were primarily driven by higher than anticipated certification and test rework and the change incorporation impact to EMD and LRIP aircraft. In the second quarter of 2016, technical complexities and schedule delays resulted in charges of $573 million. The charges were driven by costs associated with certification delays and higher costs associated with the overall revised schedule, as well as a boom axial load issue that required a hardware solution, and production concurrency between late-stage development testing and the initial production aircraft. Charges of $312 million in the fourth quarter were primarily driven by greater than anticipated effort required to incorporate previously identified changes into LRIP aircraft currently in production, along with associated manufacturing and schedule disruptions. The need for this additional work was identified as aircraft were being prepared for certification and testing. As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience further technical or quality issues, schedule delays or increased costs. The first tanker delivery is expected to occur in late 2017 with 18 fully operational aircraft to be delivered in early 2018. The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft and full rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. Russia/Ukraine We continue to monitor political unrest involving Russia and Ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. A number of our commercial customers also have operations in Russia and Ukraine. To date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries. Should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted.Export-Import Bank of the United States Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than 24Table of Contents$10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the bank’s board of directors and assist with alternative third party financing sources. Segment Results of Operations and Financial ConditionCommercial AirplanesBusiness Environment and TrendsAirline Industry Environment Passenger traffic growth is estimated at approximately 6% in 2016. While growth was strong across all major world regions, there continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models. Airlines operating in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions as well as low-cost-carriers globally are currently leading passenger growth. Air cargo traffic growth is estimated at approximately 3% in 2016. The sluggish air cargo market recovery has resulted in reduced orders and demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions.Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes and in 2016 benefited significantly from lower fuel costs. Net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to be approximately $36 billion in 2016. 2017 airline profits are expected to be slightly lower than 2016, at approximately $30 billion.The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.8% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on long-term projections of 2.9% average annual GDP growth, we project a $5.9 trillion market for approximately 39,600 new airplanes over the next 20 years. However, we continue to monitor near-term market conditions in the wide-body segment.The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations.Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 11% of Commercial Airplanes’ contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines, including cargo carriers. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and increasingly capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above 90 seats. Some of these competitors 25Table of Contentshave historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors’ revenues and profits. Many competitors are expected to benefit from the strong U.S. dollar experienced in 2016 and ongoing improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share through pricing and/or improving earnings.We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spare parts, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively.

Revenues increased by $6,058 million or 10% in 2015 compared with 2014 primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries and mix.26Table of ContentsCommercial Airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: 737*747†767 777 787Total2016 Cumulative deliveries6,203 1,528 1,096 1,460 500 Deliveries490(19) 9(3) 13 99 1377482015 Cumulative deliveries5,713 1,519 1,083 1,361 363 Deliveries495(15) 18(3) 16 98 1357622014 Cumulative deliveries5,218 1,501 1,067 1,263 228 Deliveries485(15) 19(3) 6 99 114723* Intercompany deliveries identified by parenthesesEarnings From Operations Earnings from operations in 2016 decreased by $2,027 million compared with the same period in 2015. The decrease in earnings and operating margins is primarily due to higher research and development costs of $1,415 million, delivery mix and higher reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million compared with $885 million in 2015. Research and development expense in 2016 reflect the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of $1,235 million related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher planned spending related to the 777X program. Earnings include reach-forward losses related to the KC-46A Tanker of $772 million recorded in 2016 compared with $513 million in 2015. Earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $1,254 million or 20% compared with 2014 primarily due to higher reach-forward losses of $1,160 million and higher research and development spending of $459 million, largely on the 777X, which more than offset higher new airplane deliveries and mix. During the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a charge of $885 million to recognize a reach-forward loss on the 747 program. In addition, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker contract of $513 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $238 million in the second quarter of 2014. Operating margins in 2015 decreased primarily due to additional reach-forward losses, higher research and development expense and the dilutive impact of 787 volume and mix.Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their board of directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers.The decrease in backlog during 2016 and 2015 was due to deliveries in excess of net orders. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity 27Table of Contentsis limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders.

Program Highlights737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 600 units during 2016 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 42 per month and plan to increase to 47 per month in 2017. We plan to further increase the rate to 52 per month in 2018 and to 57 per month in 2019. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017.747 Program During the fourth quarter of 2016 we received an order for 14 new aircraft. We are currently producing at rate of 0.5 aircraft per month having reduced the rate from 1.0 per month in September 2016. Lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic have continued to drive market uncertainties, pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. As a result, during 2016, we canceled previous plans to return to a production rate of 1.0 aircraft per month beginning in 2019, resulting in a reduction in the program accounting quantity from 1,574 to 1,555 aircraft. This reduction in the program accounting quantity, together with lower anticipated revenues from future sales and higher costs associated with producing fewer airplanes, resulted 28Table of Contentsin a reach-forward loss of $1,188 million in the second quarter of 2016. We previously recognized reach-forward losses of $885 million in 2015 and $70 million during the first quarter of 2016 related to our prior decision to reduce the production rate to 0.5 per month and anticipating lower estimated revenue from future sales due to ongoing pricing and market pressures. We continue to have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold production positions and we remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. If we are unable to obtain sufficient orders and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, we could record additional losses that may be material, and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747.767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during 2016 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. We increased the combined tanker and commercial production rate from 1.5 per month to 2 per month in April 2016. We plan to further increase the rate to 2.5 per month in the fourth quarter of 2017. 777 Program We produced at a rate of 8.3 per month during 2016. We implemented a planned production rate decrease to 7 per month at the beginning of 2017. In addition, we announced in December 2016 that, due to lower than anticipated 777 orders, we plan to further reduce the rate to 5 per month in the second half of 2017. We reduced the program accounting quantity from 1,650 to 1,625 aircraft, reflecting recent order activity and planned production rates. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. 787 Program During 2016, the program received 58 net new orders and increased the production rate from 10 per month to a rate of 12 per month. We are planning a further rate increase to 14 per month by the end of the decade. First delivery of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018. The accounting quantity of 1,300 units remains unchanged. We remain focused on improving productivity and obtaining additional orders to support planned production. We continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly, including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, as well as completing and delivering early build aircraft. During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with those airplanes were included in research and development expense. We produced the fourth and fifth flight test aircraft in 2009 but have been unable to sell them at acceptable prices. The aircraft have been used extensively for flight and ground testing and we intended to begin to refurbish the aircraft in early 2017 for commercial sale based on sales activity and market interest. However, during the second quarter of 2016 we determined that firm orders for these aircraft prior to refurbishment were now unlikely, and that the Company would not invest company funds for their refurbishment. The Company also determined the costs to refurbish the aircraft at a future date would be prohibitively expensive. We therefore determined that the aircraft were not commercially saleable, and accordingly, costs of $1,235 million associated with these aircraft were reclassified from 787 program inventory to research and development expense during the second quarter of 2016. We have firm orders for the five remaining undelivered early build aircraft and plan to complete retrofitting them by the end of 2017.The combination of production challenges, change incorporation on early build aircraft, schedule delays, customer and supplier impacts and changes to price escalation factors has created significant pressure on program profitability and we continue to have near breakeven gross margins. We are continuing to monitor wide-body demand and if sufficient orders do not materialize during the next several quarters we 29Table of Contentsmay consider appropriate adjustments to the planned production rate increase. If risks related to these challenges, together with risks associated with the planned production rate and productivity improvements, supply chain management or introducing or manufacturing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks.Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services.Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.Go-ahead and Initial Delivery 737 MAX2011 2017 787-10 2013 2018 777X 2013 2020 Reflects models in development during 2016We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013.Additional ConsiderationsThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 MAX and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.30Table of ContentsDefense, Space & SecurityBusiness Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment Overview The new U.S. administration and key members of the 115th Congress have expressed a general desire to reverse the effects of the budgetary reductions of the past several years. However, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (The Act), which mandated limits on U.S. government discretionary spending, remains in effect through the 2021 government fiscal year causing budget uncertainty and continued risk of future sequestration cuts. In addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows.Funding timeliness also remains a risk as the federal government is currently operating under a continuing resolution that expires on April 28, 2017. If Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills before the continuing resolution expires, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of international opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats.

In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.31Table of ContentsDeliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, including remanufactures and modifications, were as follows:Years ended December 31,2016 2015 2014F/A-18 Models25 35 44F-15 Models15 12 14C-17 Globemaster III4 5 7CH-47 Chinook (New)25 41 54CH-47 Chinook (Renewed)25 16 AH-64 Apache (New)31 23 45AH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)34 38 37P-8 Models18 14 11AEW&C 1 3C-40A11 1Total178 186 216Revenues BDS revenues in 2016 decreased by $890 million compared with the same period in 2015 due to lower revenues of $909 million and $705 million in the BMA and N&SS segments, partially offset by higher revenues of $724 million in the GS&S segment.BDS revenues in 2015 decreased by $493 million compared with 2014 primarily due to lower revenues in the GS&S and N&SS segments.Earnings From Operations BDS earnings from operations in 2016 decreased by $266 million compared with the same period in 2015 due to lower earnings of $233 million and $80 million in the N&SS and BMA segments, partially offset by higher earnings of $47 million in the GS&S segment. Included above are net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $429 million higher in 2016 compared with 2015, primarily reflecting the absence of favorable F-15 program adjustments recorded in 2015 and the charge of $162 million on the Commercial Crew program recorded at N&SS during 2016. BDS earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $141 million compared with 2014 due to higher earnings in all three segments. Included above are net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $49 million lower in 2015 compared with 2014, primarily reflecting higher charges of $135 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract recorded at BMA which more than offset higher favorable adjustments in the GS&S segment.During 2016, 2015 and 2014, BDS earnings from operations include reach-forward losses of $356 million, $322 million and $187 million on the KC-46A Tanker program.BacklogTotal backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog was $57,134 million at December 31, 2016, reflecting a decrease of 1% from December 31, 2015. BDS total backlog was $57,675 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting a decrease of 7% from December 31, 2014. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below.32Table of ContentsAdditional ConsiderationsOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Proprietary and Space Launch System (SLS) programs.Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew and commercial and military satellites.Boeing Military Aircraft Results of Operations(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2016 2015 2014Revenues$12,515 $13,424 $13,410% of total company revenues13% 14% 15%Earnings from operations$1,231 $1,311 $1,294Operating margins9.8% 9.8% 9.6%Contractual backlog$21,415 $19,947 $21,078Unobligated backlog$4,026 $7,141 $7,962Revenues BMA revenues in 2016 decreased by $909 million compared with 2015 primarily due to lower revenues of $973 million related to fewer C-17 deliveries and timing and mix of deliveries on the CH-47 Chinook and F/A-18 programs.BMA revenues in 2015 increased by $14 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher revenues of $1,131 million from a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015 on the F-15 program due to completion of contract negotiations, higher milestone revenue on the USAF KC-46A Tanker program, and higher deliveries and mix on the CH-47 Chinook program. The increase was partially offset by fewer deliveries and mix on the F/A-18, Apache and V-22 programs. Earnings From Operations BMA earnings from operations in 2016 decreased by $80 million compared with 2015 primarily due to lower volume and mix on the CH-47 Chinook, and C-17, partially offset by higher volume and mix on the Apache and P-8 programs. BMA recorded charges of $356 million in 2016 compared with $322 million in 2015 related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract. Net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $253 million higher in 2016 than in 2015 primarily driven by the absence of favorable 33Table of ContentsF-15 program adjustments recorded in 2015 and higher USAF KC-46A Tanker charges recorded in 2016.BMA earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $17 million compared with 2014 primarily due to C-17 charges in 2014, higher CH-47 Chinook deliveries in 2015 and higher earnings on the F-15 program, primarily due to a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015. These increases were partially offset by higher charges of $135 million on the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract and lower earnings on proprietary programs. BMA recorded charges of $322 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $187 million in the second quarter of 2014 related to the USAF KC-46A Tanker contract. In addition, BMA recorded a charge of $48 million in the first quarter of 2014 to write-off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of our decision to produce three fewer C-17 aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $96 million lower in 2015 than in 2014 primarily driven by the USAF KC-46A Tanker charges and lower favorable F/A-18 adjustments, partially offset by higher favorable F-15 program adjustments.During 2016, 2015 and 2014, BMA earnings from operations include reach-forward losses of $356 million, $322 million and $187 million on the KC-46A Tanker program.BacklogBMA total backlog of $25,441 million at December 31, 2016 decreased by 6% from December 31, 2015, reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by current year contract awards for the P-8, Apache, CH-47 Chinook, and weapons programs.BMA total backlog at December 31, 2015 was $27,088 million, a decrease of 7% reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by contract awards for the F-15, Apache, C-17 and F/A-18 programs.

Net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $186 million higher in 2016 than 2015 primarily reflecting the charge on the Commercial Crew program during 2016. These decreases were partially offset by higher equity earnings.N&SS earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $28 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher earnings of $83 million from improved performance on several Electronic and Information Solutions (E&IS) programs partially offset by lower performance on a development program. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $10 million lower in 2015 than in 2014 primarily due to higher unfavorable adjustments on commercial satellite programs.N&SS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $255 million, $183 million and $211 million primarily from our ULA joint venture in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. BacklogN&SS total backlog of $13,347 million at December 31, 2016 increased by 8% compared to December 31, 2015. The increase was due to adjustments recorded in 2016 related to backlog in prior years. Current year contract awards for missile defense, SLS, and government satellite programs were more than offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.N&SS total backlog was $12,347 million at December 31, 2015, reflecting a decrease of 17% from December 31, 2014 primarily due to revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by current year contract awards including orders from NASA for International Space Station engineering support and Post Certification Mission 1 on the Commercial Crew program.

GS&S revenues in 2015 decreased by $255 million compared with 2014 primarily due to final Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) deliveries and lower volume in several TSGS programs, partially offset by higher volume on several IL programs.Earnings From Operations GS&S earnings from operations in 2016 increased by $47 million compared with the same period in 2015 primarily due to higher volume and mix across the segment partially offset by lower performance. The impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was not significant in 2016. GS&S earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $96 million compared with 2014 primarily due to improved performance across the segment. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $57 million higher in 2015 than in 2014 primarily due to favorable F-15 program adjustments. BacklogGS&S total backlog has remained consistent at $18,346 million, $18,240 million and $17,951 million at December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 36Table of ContentsBoeing CapitalBusiness Environment and TrendsBCC’s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2016 totaled $4,115 million. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is related to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.BCC provided customer financing of $1,376 million and $586 million during 2016 and 2015. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2017 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. However, a number of factors could cause BCC’s new business volume to increase further, including if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, approve new financing transactions. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,200 western-built commercial jet aircraft (8.8% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2016, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 7% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2015 and 2014, 9.5% and 9.8% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2016 2015 2014Revenues$298 $413 $416Earnings from operations$59 $50 $92Operating margins20% 12% 22%Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2016 decreased by $115 million compared with 2015 primarily due to lower lease income, and lower end of lease settlement payments. BCC’s revenues in 2015 were consistent with 2014. Earnings From Operations BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2016 increased by $9 million primarily due to lower asset impairment expense which more than offset lower revenues. Earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $42 million compared with 2014 primarily due to higher asset impairment expense.37Table of ContentsFinancial PositionThe following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31:(Dollars in millions)2016 2015Customer financing and investment portfolio, net$4,109 $3,449Other assets, primarily cash and short-term investments346 480Total assets$4,455 $3,929 Other liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes$1,007 $1,099Debt, including intercompany loans2,864 2,355Equity584 475Total liabilities and equity$4,455 $3,929 Debt-to-equity ratio4.9-to-1 5.0-to-1BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2016 increased from December 31, 2015, primarily due to new volume of $1,376 million partially offset by note payoffs, asset sales and portfolio run-off. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, BCC had $6 million and $49 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $46 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2017. We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended.BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow Summary(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2016 2015 2014Net earnings$4,895 $5,176 $5,446Non-cash items2,559 2,392 2,515Changes in working capital3,045 1,795 897Net cash provided by operating activities10,499 9,363 8,858Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities(3,380) (1,846) 2,467Net cash used by financing activities(9,587) (7,920) (8,593)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(33) (28) (87)Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents(2,501) (431) 2,645Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year11,302 11,733 9,088Cash and cash equivalents at end of period$8,801 $11,302 $11,733Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $10.5 billion during 2016, compared with $9.4 billion during 2015 and $8.9 billion in 2014. The increase of $1.1 billion in 2016 was primarily 38Table of Contentsdue to lower expenditures on commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787. The increase of $0.5 billion in 2015 was primarily due to lower inventory growth, partially offset by lower receipts of advances and progress billings. Advances and progress billings decreased by $1.9 billion in 2016 and increased by $0.4 billion in 2015 and $6.9 billion in 2014. Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were $0.1 billion in 2016 and insignificant in 2015 compared with $0.8 billion in 2014. Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities during 2016 and 2015 was $3.4 billion and $1.8 billion, largely due to capital expenditures. Cash provided by investing activities during 2014 was $2.5 billion, largely due to changes in investments in time deposits. Net contributions to investments were $0.5 billion in 2016 compared with net proceeds from investments of $0.6 billion in 2015 and $4.8 billion in 2014. Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, during 2016 was $0.3 billion compared with an insignificant amount in 2015 and $0.2 billion in 2014. In 2016, capital expenditures totaled $2.6 billion, up from $2.5 billion in 2015 and $2.2 billion in 2014. We expect capital expenditures in 2017 to be lower than 2016.Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $9.6 billion during 2016, an increase of $1.7 billion compared with 2015 primarily due to net borrowings in 2015 as well as higher share repurchases and dividend payments in 2016. Cash used by financing activities was $7.9 billion during 2015, a decrease of $0.7 billion compared with 2014 primarily due to higher new borrowings in 2015 of $0.8 billion and lower repayments of debt and distribution rights of $0.9 billion in 2015, which more than offset higher share repurchases of $0.8 billion and higher dividend payments of $0.4 billion.During 2016, we issued $1.3 billion and repaid $1.4 billion of debt. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 the recorded balance of debt was $10.0 billion and $10.0 billion of which $0.4 billion and $1.2 billion was classified as short-term. At December 31, 2016 and 2015 this included $2.9 billion and $2.4 billion of debt attributable to BCC, of which $0.1 billion and $0.5 billion were classified as short-term.During 2016 and 2015 we repurchased 55.1 million and 46.7 million shares totaling $7.0 billion and $6.8 billion through our open market share repurchase program. In 2016 and 2015, we had 0.7 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2016, the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 12, 2016, totaled $14 billion.Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2016 and at December 31, 2016, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $5.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs.Financing commitments totaled $14.8 billion and $16.3 billion at December 31, 2016 and 2015. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers.In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy 39Table of Contentsexisting short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities.At December 31, 2016 and 2015, our pension plans were $20.1 billion and $17.9 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2016 with minimal required contributions in 2017. We expect to make contributions to our plans of approximately $0.5 billion in 2017. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.At December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2016, and the estimated timing thereof.(Dollars in millions)Total Lessthan 1year 1-3years 3-5years After 5yearsLong-term debt (including current portion)$9,945 $327 $1,911 $1,840 $5,867Interest on debt(1)5,656 459 872 691 3,634Pension and other postretirement cash requirements15,476 779 3,412 3,969 7,316Capital lease obligations144 60 64 13 7Operating lease obligations1,494 239 400 235 620Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position107,564 38,458 31,381 20,478 17,247Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position17,415 16,652 746 3 14Total contractual obligations (2)$157,694 $56,974 $38,786 $27,229 $34,705(1) Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2016. Variable rate debt was 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2016.(2) Excludes income tax matters. As of December 31, 2016, our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions of $1,557 million, was $1,169 million. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 40Table of ContentsPurchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2016, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2016, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $18.1 billion that extend through 2029. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.41Table of ContentsCommercial CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2016.(Dollars in millions)Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3years 4-5years After 5yearsStandby letters of credit and surety bonds$4,701 $3,051 $805 $3 $842Commercial aircraft financing commitments14,847 2,432 6,874 3,493 2,048Total commercial commitments$19,548 $5,483 $7,679 $3,496 $2,890Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required, particularly if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, provide new financing support. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Contingent ObligationsWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $562 million at December 31, 2016. For additional information, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-GAAP MeasuresCore Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per ShareOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of certain pension and other postretirement benefit expenses that are not allocated to business segments. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to Commercial Airplanes. Pension costs allocated to BDS segments are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally 42Table of Contentsbased on benefits paid. The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings during 2016 was a benefit of $217 million compared with an expense of $421 million and $1,469 million in 2015 and 2014. The 2016 benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period, as well as lower settlements and curtailments. The 2015 unallocated expense is lower than 2014, primarily due to the lower amortization of pension costs capitalized as inventory in prior years as well as lower settlements and curtailments. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 21 and 22 of this Form 10-K and see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP MeasuresThe table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share.

Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operations by $912 million and $224 million. For the year ended December 31, 2014 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by $100 million.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2016 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $295 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.Program AccountingProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.44Table of ContentsFactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 and 777X programs, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segment’s operating margins. For the year ended December 31, 2016, a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segment would have a $650 million impact on operating earnings. The 747 program was in a reach-forward loss position at December 31, 2016 and 2015. Deliveries of 747s in 2016 were recorded at a zero margin and absent changes in estimated revenues or costs, future 747 deliveries will be recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately as an additional reach-forward loss. It is reasonably possible that we could make a decision to terminate the 747 program, which may result in additional reach-forward losses which may be material. The 787 program had near breakeven margins during 2016. If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if our assumptions with respect to items such as pricing, cost or future production rates were to change, we could be required to record reach-forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results. 45Table of ContentsGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible ImpairmentsWe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2016 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2016, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets.Pension PlansThe majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.46Table of ContentsThe following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2016.(Dollars in millions)Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bpsPension plans Projected benefit obligation($2,218) $2,793Net periodic pension cost(89) 107Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2016 net periodic pension expense by $147 million. We expect 2017 net periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately $214 million and the portion recognized in earnings to decrease by approximately $1,315 million primarily due to lower service cost and amortization of actuarial losses.OtherSection 219 of the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012 and Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Act”), require disclosure of certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran that occurred during the period covered by this report. Disclosure is required even if the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. We have disclosed such activities in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the first quarter of 2016 and such disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate RiskWe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2016, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2016, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $226 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.47Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:51.931470

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations and Financial ConditionOverviewWe are a global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS), and Global Services (BGS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders. BCA is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. BGS provides support for commercial, defense and space customers through innovative, comprehensive, and cost-competitive product and service solutions. Our strategy also benefits us as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets sometimes offset. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.Consolidated Results of Operations The following table summarizes key indicators of consolidated results of operations:(Dollars in millions, except per share data) Years ended December 31,2017 2016 2015Revenues$93,392 $94,571 $96,114 GAAP Earnings from operations10,278 5,834 7,443Operating margins11.0% 6.2% 7.7%Effective income tax rate18.4% 12.1% 27.7%Net earnings$8,197 $4,895 $5,176Diluted earnings per share$13.43 $7.61 $7.44 Non-GAAP (1) Core operating earnings$8,970 $5,464 $7,741Core operating margins9.6% 5.8% 8.1%Core earnings per share$12.04 $7.24 $7.72(1)These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense.

BCA revenues decreased by $1,283 million or 2% primarily due to delivery mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting the impact of higher single aisle deliveries. BDS revenues decreased by $1,506 million primarily due to fewer C-17 deliveries, lower milestone revenue on satellite programs, and the mix of deliveries on the Apache and F-15 programs, partially offset by higher volume on various weapons programs. The decreases at BCA and BDS were partially offset by higher unallocated revenue and higher BGS revenue, primarily due to higher commercial parts revenue. Revenues in 2016 decreased by $1,543 million or 2% compared with 2015. BCA revenues decreased by $1,387 million or 2% due fewer deliveries. BDS revenues decreased by $1,145 million or 5% primarily due to lower milestone revenue on government satellite programs, fewer C-17 deliveries, lower Commercial Crew revenue, as well as timing and mix of CH-47 Chinook deliveries, partially offset by higher revenue on several modifications and upgrades programs. The decreases at BCA and BDS were partially offset by higher BGS revenue, primarily due to higher commercial parts revenue and government services revenue.The changes in unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2017, 2016 and 2015 primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries and the sale of aircraft previously leased to customers.

BCA's 2017 earnings increased by $3,437 million primarily reflecting lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs, and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance, which more than offset the impact of lower revenues. In 2016, BCA recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million on the 747 program and reclassified $1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft inventory costs to research and development expense. BDS earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $257 million compared with 2016 primarily due to lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs, which more than offset the impact of fewer C-17 deliveries and Apache delivery mix. Earnings from operations in 2016 decreased by $1,609 million compared with 2015 due to lower earnings at BCA, partially offset by the change in unallocated pension and postretirement income/(expense). BCA earnings in 2016 decreased by $2,289 million primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft costs to research and development and higher reach-forward losses on the 747 and KC-46A Tanker programs. The reclassification of flight test aircraft costs was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of our determination that two 787 flight test aircraft were no longer commercially saleable. The change in the unallocated pension and postretirement income/(expense) in 2016 was primarily driven by lower service costs and lower amortization of actuarial losses. During 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program. In 2017, we recorded charges of $471 million, of which $378 million was recorded at BCA and $93 million at BDS. During 2016, we recorded charges of $1,128 million: $772 million at BCA and $356 million at BDS. During 2015, we recorded charges of $835 million: $513 million at BCA and $322 million at BDS. During 2016 and 2015 we recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million and $885 million.Core operating earnings for 2017 increased by $3,506 million compared with 2016 primarily due to lower reach forward losses and the reclassification of costs related to the 787 flight test aircraft in 2016. Core operating earnings in 2016 decreased by $2,227 million compared with 2015 primarily due to the reclassification of costs related to the 787 flight test aircraft and higher charges on the 747 and KC-46A Tanker programs described above.

See pages 39 - 40.20Table of ContentsDeferred compensation expense increased by $194 million in 2017 and decreased by $17 million in 2016, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price.Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $117 million in 2017 and increased by $20 million in 2016 primarily due to the timing of the elimination of profit on intercompany aircraft deliveries and expense allocations. Net periodic benefit cost related to pension totaled $312 million, $523 million and $2,786 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The components of net periodic benefit cost are shown in the following table: PensionYears ended December 31,2017 2016 2015Service cost$402 $604 $1,764Interest cost2,991 3,050 2,990Expected return on plan assets(3,847) (3,999) (4,031)Amortization of prior service costs(39) 38 196Recognized net actuarial loss804 790 1,577Settlement/curtailment/other losses1 40 290Net periodic benefit cost$312 $523 $2,786The decreases in net periodic pension benefit costs of $211 million in 2017 and of $2,263 million in 2016 are primarily due to lower service costs reflecting the transition of employees in 2016 to defined contribution retirement savings plans. The decrease in 2016 costs is also due to lower amortization of actuarial losses which reflects actuarial gains in 2015 resulting from the year-end discount rate increase from 3.9% to 4.2%. A portion of net periodic benefit cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods. Costs are allocated to the business segments as described in Note 21.Net periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows:(Dollars in millions)PensionYears ended December 31,2017 2016 2015Allocated to business segments($1,759) ($2,196) ($1,945)Unallocated items, eliminations and other1,120 217 (421)Total($639) ($1,979) ($2,366)The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings in 2017 was a benefit of $1,120 million compared with $217 million in 2016. The higher unallocated pension benefit recognized in earnings in 2017 primarily reflects the amortization of pension benefits capitalized as inventory in prior years. The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings in 2016 was a benefit of $217 million compared with expense of $421 million in 2015. The 2016 benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period. 21Table of ContentsOther Earnings Items(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2017 2016 2015Earnings from operations$10,278 $5,834 $7,443Other income/(loss), net129 40 (13)Interest and debt expense(360) (306) (275)Earnings before income taxes10,047 5,568 7,155Income tax expense(1,850) (673) (1,979)Net earnings from continuing operations$8,197 $4,895 $5,176Other income, net increased by $89 million and $53 million in 2017 and 2016, primarily due to higher gains from foreign exchange and interest income.Interest and debt expense increased by $54 million in 2017 as a result of lower capitalized interest and increased by $31 million in 2016 as a result of higher average debt balances.Our effective income tax rates were 18.4%, 12.1% and 27.7% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, enacted in December 2017, reduced the 2017 effective tax rate by 10.5% and resulted in incremental tax benefits of $1,051 million, primarily related to the remeasurement of our U.S. net deferred tax liabilities to reflect the reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. Our 2016 effective tax rate was lower than the 2015 rate primarily due to lower pre-tax income in 2016 and discrete tax benefits of $617 million recorded in the third quarter of 2016 related to tax basis adjustments and the settlement of the 2011-2012 federal tax audit. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our Commercial Airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales, BDS predominantly uses contract accounting and BGS uses contract accounting for defense contracts. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. Under contract accounting, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. The following table summarizes cost of sales:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2017 2016Change 2016 2015ChangeCost of sales$76,066 $80,790($4,724) $80,790 $82,088($1,298)Cost of sales as a % of revenues81.4% 85.4%(4.0%) 85.4% 85.4%0.0%Cost of sales in 2017 decreased by $4,724 million, or 6%, compared with 2016, primarily due to lower reach-forward losses, delivery model mix at BCA and improved performance at BCA and BDS. Cost of sales in 2016 decreased by $1,298 million, or 2%, compared with 2015, primarily due to lower volume across all segments, partially offset by the 747 reach-forward losses at BCA.22Table of ContentsResearch and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2017 2016 2015Commercial Airplanes$2,247 $3,706 $2,311Defense, Space & Security834 815 902Global Services140 153 113Other(42) (47) 5Total$3,179 $4,627 $3,331Research and development expense in 2017 decreased by $1,448 million compared with 2016 primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of costs from inventory in the second quarter of 2016 related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft as well as lower spending on the 737 MAX, 787-10, and 777X.Research and development expense in 2016 increased by $1,296 million compared with 2015 primarily due to the reclassification of $1,235 million of costs from inventory in the second quarter of 2016 related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher spending on the 777X.BacklogOur backlog at December 31 was as follows:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2017 2016 2015Commercial Airplanes$421,345 $413,036 $429,346Defense, Space & Security49,577 44,825 46,933Global Services17,223 15,631 13,020Total Backlog$488,145 $473,492 $489,299 Contractual backlog470,241 458,277 476,595Unobligated backlog17,904 $15,215 $12,704Total Backlog$488,145 $473,492 $489,299Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2017 was primarily due to orders and funding in excess of deliveries. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2016 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The increase in unobligated backlog in 2017 and 2016 was primarily due to contract awards, partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS and BGS contracts.Additional ConsiderationsKC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. In 2015, we began work on low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft for the USAF. During the third quarter of 2016, following our achievement of key flight testing milestones, the USAF authorized two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion. On January 27, 2017, the USAF authorized an additional 23Table of ContentsLRIP lot for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1 billion. The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft and full rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. The EMD contract is currently in the certification and flight testing phases and we expect 18 fully operational aircraft to be delivered in 2018.During 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,128 million and $835 million related to the EMD contract and LRIP aircraft. During 2017, we recorded further reach-forward losses of $471 million primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification and incorporating changes into LRIP aircraft. As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses or delivery delays if we experience further production, technical or quality issues, delays in certification and/or flight testing. Export-Import Bank of the United States Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the bank’s board of directors and assist with alternative third party financing sources. Segment Results of Operations and Financial ConditionCommercial AirplanesBusiness Environment and TrendsAirline Industry Environment Global economic growth, a primary driver for air travel, has returned to the long-term average of approximately 3%. Passenger traffic in 2017 is estimated to grow by more than 7%, exceeding the long-term trend of approximately 5%. While growth was strong across all major world regions, there continues to be variation between regions and airline business models. Airlines operating in the Asia Pacific regions and Europe, as well as low-cost-carriers globally, are currently leading the growth in passenger traffic. Air cargo traffic growth, building on the recovery that started in 2016, is expected to exceed 9% in 2017, driven by strong trade and industrial production in all regions.Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also focusing on reducing costs and renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes. Net profits in 2017 are expected to approximate $35 billion, consistent with 2016.The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.7% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.8% average annual GDP growth, we project a $6.1 trillion market for approximately 41,030 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations.24Table of ContentsIndustry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 91% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier continue to develop and market larger and increasingly more capable airplanes, including Embraer’s E-195 in the regional jet market and Bombardier’s C Series in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Many competitors have continued to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.We are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our cost-reduction efforts, which enhances our ability to compete. We are also focused on taking actions to ensure that Boeing is not harmed by unfair subsidization of competitors.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2017 2016 2015Revenues$56,729 $58,012 $59,399% of total company revenues61% 61% 62%Earnings from operations$5,432 $1,995 $4,284Operating margins9.6% 3.4% 7.2%Research and development$2,247 $3,706 $2,311Revenues Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $1,283 million or 2% in 2017 compared with 2016 due to delivery mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting the impact of higher single aisle deliveries. Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $1,387 million or 2% in 2016 compared with 2015 primarily due to fewer deliveries. 25Table of ContentsCommercial Airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: 737*747†767 777 787Total2017 Cumulative deliveries6,732 1,542 1,106 1,534 636 Deliveries529(17) 14(1) 10 74 1367632016 Cumulative deliveries6,203 1,528 1,096 1,460 500 Deliveries490(19) 9(3) 13 99 1377482015 Cumulative deliveries5,713 1,519 1,083 1,361 363 Deliveries495(15) 18(3) 16 98 135762* Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses† Aircraft accounted for as revenues by BCA and as operating leases in consolidation identified by parenthesesEarnings From Operations Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $3,437 million compared with 2016. The increase in earnings and operating margins is primarily due to lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance, which more than offset the impact of lower revenues. Earnings from operations in 2016 decreased by $2,289 million compared with 2015. The decrease in earnings and operating margins is primarily due to higher research and development costs of $1,395 million, delivery mix and higher reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million compared with $885 million in 2015. Research and development expense in 2016 reflect the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of $1,235 million related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher planned spending related to the 777X program. Reach-forward losses of $378 million, $772 million and $513 million were recorded related to the KC-46A Tanker in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. During 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million and $885 million.Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm backlog excludes options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers.BCA total backlog was $421,345 million, $413,036 million and $429,346 million at December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The increase in 2017 was primarily due to net orders in excess of deliveries. The decrease in 2016 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. 26Table of ContentsAccounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders.

Program Highlights737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 800 units during 2017 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 47 per month and plan to increase to 52 per month in 2018. We plan to further increase the rate to 57 per month in 2019. We delivered the first 737 MAX 8 in May 2017 and announced the launch of the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017.747 Program During the fourth quarter of 2017, we received firm orders and commitments for 15 aircraft and we increased the program accounting quantity by 15 aircraft. The program accounting quantity now includes aircraft scheduled to be produced through 2021. We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month, having reduced the rate from 1.0 per month in September 2016. In 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million and $885 million as lower than expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic 27Table of Contentsresulted in lower anticipated revenues from future sales and higher costs to produce fewer airplanes. We continue to evaluate the viability of the 747 program and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during the third quarter of 2017 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. The combined tanker and commercial production rate increased from 2 per month to 2.5 per month in the third quarter of 2017. 777 Program We implemented a planned production rate decrease from 8.3 per month to 7 per month during the first quarter of 2017. We further reduced the rate to 5 per month in the third quarter of 2017. In the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. 787 Program The accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 100 units during the third quarter of 2017 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 12 per month and plan to increase to 14 per month in 2019. First delivery of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1.0% of total consolidated costs of products and services.Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.Go-ahead and Initial Delivery 737 MAX 72011 2019 737 MAX 82011 2017 737 MAX 92011 2018 737 MAX 10 2017 2020 787-10 2013 2018 777X 2013 2020 Reflects models in development during 2017We launched the 737 MAX 7, 8, 9 in August 2011 and the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017. We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013.Additional ConsiderationsThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-10 and 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting 28Table of Contentsquantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.Defense, Space & Security Business Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment OverviewIn November 2017, Congress passed the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 (FY2018), which authorizes a U.S. DoD budget topline higher than the administration’s budget request from May. While the appropriations process for FY2018 remains incomplete, both the House and Senate appropriations committees have also produced bills that increase the U.S. DoD budget topline above the administration’s request. On February 9, 2018, Congress passed a fifth Continuing Resolution that maintains current funding levels through March 23, 2018 and includes increases to the Budget Control Act caps for defense and non-defense spending for FY2018 and FY2019. However, the Budget Control Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending and remains in effect. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts will remain unless Congress acts to repeal or suspend this law. Funding timeliness also remains a risk. If Congress is unable to pass appropriations bills or an omnibus spending bill before the expiration of the current Continuing Resolution, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. For example, requirements to furlough employees in the U.S. DoD, the Department of Transportation, or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. In addition, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), within the overall budgetary framework described above. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows. Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2017, 40% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-US customers.29Table of ContentsResults of Operations(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2017 2016 2015Revenues$21,057 $22,563 $23,708% of total company revenues23% 24% 25%Earnings from operations$2,223 $1,966 $2,312Operating margins10.6% 8.7% 9.8%Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues, earnings and backlog may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, including remanufactures and modifications were as follows:Years ended December 31,2017 2016 2015F/A-18 Models23 25 35F-15 Models16 15 12C-17 Globemaster III 4 5CH-47 Chinook (New)9 25 41CH-47 Chinook (Renewed)35 25 16AH-64 Apache (New)11 31 23AH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)57 34 38P-8 Models19 18 14AEW&C 1C-40A 1 1Total170 178 186New-build satellite deliveries were as follows:Years ended December 31,2017 2016 2015Commercial and civil satellites3 5 3Military satellites1 2 1Revenues BDS revenues in 2017 decreased by $1,506 million compared with 2016 primarily due to fewer C-17 deliveries, lower milestone revenue on satellite programs, and the mix of deliveries on the Apache and F-15 programs, partially offset by higher volume on various weapons programs.BDS revenues in 2016 decreased by $1,145 million compared with 2015 primarily due to lower milestone revenue on government satellite programs, fewer C-17 deliveries, lower Commercial Crew revenue, as well as timing and mix of CH-47 Chinook deliveries, partially offset by higher revenue on several modifications and upgrades programs.30Table of ContentsEarnings From Operations BDS earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $257 million compared with 2016 primarily due to lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs, which more than offset the impact of fewer C-17 deliveries and Apache delivery mix. Higher earnings reflect the favorable impact of cumulative catch-up adjustments which were $541 million higher in 2017 than in 2016, primarily driven by lower charges.BDS earnings from operations in 2016 decreased by $346 million compared with 2015, primarily due to lower earnings on the Commercial Crew program, driven by a charge of $162 million during the third quarter of 2016, as well as lower volume and mix on the CH-47 Chinook program. Lower earnings include the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments which were $441 million higher than 2015, primarily due to Commercial Crew charges in 2016 and the absence of favorable F-15 program adjustments recorded in 2015.BDS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $183 million, $249 million and $202 million primarily from our ULA joint venture in 2017, 2016 and 2015.During 2017, 2016 and 2015, BDS recorded charges related to the KC-46A Tanker contract of $93 million, $356 million and $322 million.BacklogTotal backlog of $49,577 million at December 31, 2017 increased by 11% from December 31, 2016, primarily due to current year contract awards for the F-15 and Apache programs, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.Total backlog of $44,825 million at December 31, 2016 decreased by 4% reflecting revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by current year contract awards for satellite, P-8, weapons, Apache and CH-47 Chinook programs.Additional ConsiderationsOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, and commercial and military satellites.KC-46A Tanker See the discussion of the USAF KC-46A Tanker program on page 23. 31Table of ContentsUnited Launch Alliance See the discussion of Indemnifications to ULA and Financing Commitments in Notes 6, 11, and 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.F/A-18 See the discussion of the F/A-18 program in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Sea Launch See the discussion of the Sea Launch receivables in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Commercial Crew See the discussion of Fixed-Price Development Contracts in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Global Services Business Environment and TrendsThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics, and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering, and upgrades; training and professional services; and information services. We expect the market to grow by around 3.5% annually. As the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of airplanes. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.Government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability. BGS’ major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 29, which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2017 2016 2015Revenues$14,639 $13,925 $13,293% of total company revenues16% 15% 14%Earnings from operations$2,256 $2,177 $1,835Operating margins15.4% 15.6% 13.8%32Table of ContentsRevenues BGS revenues in 2017 increased by $714 million compared with 2016 primarily due to higher commercial parts revenue.BGS revenues in 2016 increased by $632 million compared with 2015 primarily due to higher commercial parts revenues and government services revenue. Earnings From Operations BGS earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $79 million compared with 2016 primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by commercial services mix. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $9 million lower in 2017 than in 2016.BGS earnings from operations in 2016 increased by $342 million compared with 2015 primarily due to higher revenues and favorable mix of commercial parts and government services. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $12 million higher in 2016 than in 2015.BacklogBGS total backlog of $17,223 million at December 31, 2017 increased by 10% from December 31, 2016, primarily due to current year contract awards including F-15, C-17, and Apache support programs.BGS total backlog of $15,631 million at December 31, 2016 increased by 20% from December 31, 2015 primarily due to current year contract awards including the C-17 support program.Boeing CapitalBusiness Environment and TrendsBCC’s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2017 totaled $3,006 million. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is related to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.BCC provided customer financing of $480 million and $1,376 million during 2017 and 2016. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2018 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. However, a number of factors could cause BCC’s new business volume to increase further, including if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, approve new financing transactions. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,000 western-built commercial jet aircraft (8.3% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2017, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 2% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2016 and 2015, 8.8% and 9.5% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.33Table of ContentsResults of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2017 2016 2015Revenues$307 $298 $413Earnings from operations$114 $59 $50Operating margins37% 20% 12%Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2017 were consistent with 2016.BCC’s revenues in 2016 decreased by $115 million compared with 2015 primarily due to lower lease income, and lower end of lease settlement payments.Earnings From Operations BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $55 million primarily due to lower asset impairment and depreciation expenses. Earnings from operations in 2016 increased by $9 million primarily due to lower asset impairment expense which more than offset lower revenues.

Aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $25 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2018. We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended.BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.34Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow Summary(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2017 2016 2015Net earnings$8,197 $4,895 $5,176Non-cash items2,652 2,559 2,392Changes in working capital2,495 3,045 1,795Net cash provided by operating activities13,344 10,499 9,363Net cash used by investing activities(2,062) (3,380) (1,846)Net cash used by financing activities(11,350) (9,587) (7,920)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents80 (33) (28)Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents12 (2,501) (431)Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year8,801 11,302 11,733Cash and cash equivalents at end of period$8,813 $8,801 $11,302Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $13.3 billion during 2017, compared with $10.5 billion during 2016 and $9.4 billion in 2015. The increase of $2.8 billion in 2017 was primarily driven by higher advances more than offsetting inventory increases. The increase of $1.1 billion in 2016 was primarily due to lower expenditures on commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787. Advances and progress billings increased by $4.6 billion in 2017, decreased by $1.9 billion in 2016 and increased by $0.4 billion in 2015. During 2017, our discretionary contributions to our pension plans included 14.4 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5 billion and $0.5 billion in cash. Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were insignificant in 2016 and 2015. Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities during 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $2.1 billion, $3.4 billion and $1.8 billion. Capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion in 2017, down from $2.6 billion in 2016 and $2.5 billion in 2015. We expect capital expenditures in 2018 to be higher than 2017. Net proceeds from investments was insignificant in 2017. Net contributions to investments were $0.5 billion in 2016 compared with net proceeds from investments of $0.6 billion in 2015. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $11.4 billion during 2017, an increase of $1.8 billion compared with 2016, primarily due to higher share repurchases and dividend payments. During 2017, our net borrowings were $1.1 billion compared with minimal net repayments in 2016. Cash used by financing activities was $9.6 billion during 2016, an increase of $1.7 billion compared with 2015, primarily due to lower net borrowings and higher dividend payments and share repurchases. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 the recorded balance of debt was $11.1 billion and $10.0 billion of which $1.3 billion and $0.4 billion was classified as short-term. At December 31, 2017 and 2016 this included $2.5 billion and $2.9 billion of debt attributable to BCC, of which $0.9 billion and $0.1 billion were classified as short-term.During 2017 and 2016 we repurchased 46.1 million and 55.1 million shares totaling $9.2 billion and $7.0 billion through our open market share repurchase program. In 2017 and 2016, we had 0.7 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2017, the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 11, 2017, totaled $18 billion.Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper 35Table of Contentsprogram that serves as a source of short-term liquidity. At December 31, 2017, commercial paper borrowings totaling $600 million were supported by unused commitments under the revolving credit agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings in 2016. Currently, we have $5.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Financing commitments totaled $10.2 billion and $14.8 billion at December 31, 2017 and 2016. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers.In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities.At December 31, 2017 and 2016, our pension plans were $16.4 billion and $20.1 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2017 with minimal required contributions in 2018. During 2017, we contributed shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5 billion and $0.5 billion in cash. We do not expect to make contributions to our pension plans in 2018. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.36Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2017, and the estimated timing thereof.(Dollars in millions)Total Lessthan 1year 1-3years 3-5years After 5yearsLong-term debt (including current portion)$11,130 $1,285 $2,362 $1,266 $6,217Interest on debt5,635 478 831 672 3,654Pension and other postretirement cash requirements6,190 609 1,245 1,246 3,090Capital lease obligations147 55 61 16 15Operating lease obligations1,367 220 365 212 570Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position115,064 48,375 31,369 23,223 12,097Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position18,630 18,289 325 2 14Total contractual obligations (1)$158,163 $69,311 $36,558 $26,637 $25,657(1) Excludes income tax matters. As of December 31, 2017, our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions of $1,736 million, was $1,634 million. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, customer financing equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.37Table of ContentsIndustrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2017, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2017, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $17.9 billion that extend through 2030. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.Commercial CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2017.(Dollars in millions)Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3years 4-5years After 5yearsStandby letters of credit and surety bonds$3,708 $1,659 $782 $559 $708Commercial aircraft financing commitments10,221 2,047 4,372 2,256 1,546Total commercial commitments$13,929 $3,706 $5,154 $2,815 $2,254Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required, particularly if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, provide new financing support. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Contingent ObligationsWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $524 million at December 31, 2017. For additional information, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.38Table of ContentsNon-GAAP MeasuresCore Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per ShareOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of certain pension and other postretirement benefit expenses that are not allocated to business segments. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid. The unallocated pension costs recognized in earnings during 2017 was a benefit of $1,120 million compared with a benefit of $217 million in 2016 and an expense of $421 million in 2015. The higher 2017 benefit reflects the amortization of pension benefits capitalized as inventory in prior years. The 2016 benefit reflects the difference between the higher segment allocation compared to the U.S. GAAP net periodic pension costs recognized in earnings in the current period, as well as lower settlements and curtailments. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 20 and 21 of this Form 10-K and see Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.39Table of ContentsReconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP MeasuresThe table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share.

Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the year ended December 31, 2017 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased Earnings from operations by $14 million. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased Earnings from operations by $912 million and $224 million. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS and defense contracts at BGS for all of 2017 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $280 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.Program AccountingProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.41Table of ContentsFactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. For example, in 2016 and 2015, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million and $885 million on the 747 program. We continue to evaluate the viability of the 747 program and it is reasonably possible that we could decide to end production of the 747.The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 and 777X programs, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segment’s operating margins. For the year ended December 31, 2017, a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segment would have a $567 million impact on operating earnings.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible ImpairmentsWe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.42Table of ContentsWe estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2017 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As a result of the change in our reportable segments, as described in Note 21, we reallocated goodwill to our new reporting units using a relative fair value approach. We evaluated goodwill for impairment at July 1, 2017 and determined that no impairment existed. As of December 31, 2017, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets.Pension PlansThe majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2017.(Dollars in millions)Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bpsPension plans Projected benefit obligation($2,364) $2,961Net periodic pension cost(84) 99Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2017 net periodic pension expense by $148 million. We expect 2018 net periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately $44 million and the portion recognized in earnings before income taxes to decrease by approximately $512 million primarily due to lower amortization of actuarial losses.43Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate RiskWe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2017, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2017, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $289 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.44Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:50.687489

BCA revenues increased by $2,701 million due to higher 737 and 787 deliveries and favorable 737 and 787 model mix, which more than offset lower 777 and 747 deliveries. BDS revenues increased by $2,634 million primarily due to non-US contract awards for fighters, higher weapons revenue, the final C-17 aircraft sale and higher satellites revenue. BGS revenues increased by $2,437 million due to growth across our services portfolio, primarily driven by higher parts revenue including the acquisition of KLX Inc. (KLX). The increases at BCA, BDS, and BGS were partially offset by lower unallocated revenue.Revenues in 2017 increased by $509 million or 1% compared with 2016. BDS revenues increased by $381 million primarily due to higher weapons revenue. BGS revenues increased by $762 million primarily due to higher commercial parts revenue. The increases at BDS and BGS were partially offset by lower BCA revenues, primarily due to delivery mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting the impact of higher single aisle deliveries.The changes in Unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2018, 2017 and 2016 primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries and the sale of aircraft previously leased to customers. 19Table of ContentsEarnings From Operations The following table summarizes Earnings from operations:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Commercial Airplanes$7,879 $5,452 $1,981Defense, Space & Security1,594 2,193 1,678Global Services2,522 2,246 2,159Boeing Capital79 114 59Segment Operating Profit12,074 10,005 5,877Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment1,005 1,127 1,029Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment322 311 328Unallocated items, eliminations and other(1,414) (1,099) (707)Earnings from operations (GAAP)$11,987 $10,344 $6,527FAS/CAS service cost adjustment * (1,327) (1,438) (1,357)Core operating earnings (Non-GAAP) **$10,660 $8,906 $5,170*The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. **Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. See page 40.Earnings from operations in 2018 increased by $1,643 million compared with 2017, primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BGS, which more than offset the decrease at BDS and the change in Unallocated items, eliminations and other. BCA earnings from operations increased by $2,427 million in 2018 due to higher revenues and improved operating margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due to higher 787 margins, improved cost performance and favorable delivery mix. BGS earnings from operations increased by $276 million in 2018 primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher period costs. BDS earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $599 million compared with 2017 as earnings’ growth from higher revenues was more than offset by charges of $691 million related to winning the T-X Trainer and MQ-25 competitions, as well as $199 million of higher KC-46A Tanker reach-forward losses.Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $3,817 million compared with 2016 due to higher earnings at BCA and BDS, partially offset by the change in Unallocated items, eliminations and other. BCA earnings from operations increased by $3,471 million in 2017 primarily due to lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs, and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance. In 2016, BCA recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million on the 747 program and reclassified $1,235 million of 787 flight test aircraft inventory costs to research and development. The reclassification of flight test aircraft costs was recorded in the second quarter of 2016 as a result of our determination that two 787 flight test aircraft were no longer commercially saleable. BDS earnings from operations increased by $515 million in 2017 primarily due to lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs.During 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program. In 2018, we recorded charges of $736 million, of which $500 million was recorded at BCA, $222 million at BDS, and $14 million at BGS. During 2017, we recorded charges of $445 million: $378 million at BCA, $44 million at BGS, and $23 million at BDS. During 2016, we recorded charges of $1,127 million: $772 million at BCA and $351 million at BDS. Core operating earnings for 2018 increased by $1,754 million compared with 2017 primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BGS, partially offset by lower earnings at BDS and higher unallocated expenses.20Table of ContentsCore operating earnings in 2017 increased by $3,736 million compared with 2016 primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BDS.Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Share-based plans($76) ($77) ($66)Deferred compensation(19) (240) (46)Eliminations and other unallocated items(1,319) (782) (595)Unallocated items, eliminations and other($1,414) ($1,099) ($707)Deferred compensation expense decreased by $221 million in 2018 and increased by $194 million in 2017, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price.Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $537 million in 2018 primarily due to timing of expense allocations, higher research and development expense and a $148 million charge incurred related to the outcome of the Spirit litigation. See the discussion in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $187 million in 2017 primarily due to the timing of expense allocations. A portion of service cost is recognized in Earnings from operations in the period incurred and the remainder is included in inventory at the end of the reporting period and recorded in Earnings from operations in subsequent periods.Net periodic pension benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows:(Dollars in millions)PensionYears ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Allocated to business segments($1,318) ($1,637) ($2,286)Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment1,005 1,127 1,029Net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations($313) ($510) ($1,257)The pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in earnings in 2018, 2017, and 2016 were largely consistent across all periods. The decrease in net periodic benefit costs included in Earnings from operations in 2017 was primarily due to lower service costs reflecting the transition of employees in 2016 to defined contribution retirement savings plans.For additional discussion related to Postretirement Plans, see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.21Table of ContentsOther Earnings Items(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Earnings from operations$11,987 $10,344 $6,527Other income/(loss), net92 123 (438)Interest and debt expense(475) (360) (306)Earnings before income taxes11,604 10,107 5,783Income tax expense(1,144) (1,649) (749)Net earnings from continuing operations$10,460 $8,458 $5,034Other income/(loss), net decreased by $31 million in 2018 primarily due to lower gains from foreign exchange, partially offset by higher interest income. Other income/(loss), net increased by $561 million in 2017 primarily due to a decrease in non-operating pension and postretirement costs and higher gains from foreign exchange. The non-operating pension expense included in Other income/(loss), net was a benefit of $143 million in 2018 and $117 million in 2017, compared with an expense of $327 million in 2016. The benefits in 2018 and 2017 reflect expected returns in excess of interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses. The expense in 2016 reflects the amortization of non-service costs previously capitalized as inventory in prior years, primarily interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses in excess of expected returns.Interest and debt expense increased by $115 million in 2018 as a result of higher debt balances and lower capitalized interest and increased by $54 million in 2017 as a result of lower capitalized interest.For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. For long-term contracts, the amount reported as cost of sales is recognized as incurred. Substantially all contracts at our BDS segment, certain military derivative aircraft contracts at BCA and certain contracts at our BGS segment are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Costs on these contracts are recorded as incurred.

The increase in contractual backlog during 2018 was primarily due to BDS orders and funding for contract awards in excess of revenue recognized. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The increase in unobligated backlog in 2018 was primarily due to contract awards, partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS and BGS contracts.Additional ConsiderationsKC-46A Tanker In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs and systems integration. In 2016, following our achievement of key flight testing milestones, the USAF authorized two LRIP lots for 7 and 12 aircraft valued at $2.8 billion, and in 2017, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 15 aircraft valued at $2.1 billion. On September 10, 2018, the USAF authorized an additional LRIP lot for 18 aircraft valued at $2.9 billion. The contract contains production options for both LRIP aircraft and 23Table of Contentsfull rate production aircraft. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. In January 2019, we delivered the first KC-46A Tanker to the USAF.During 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,127 million related to the EMD contract and LRIP aircraft. During 2017, we recorded reach-forward losses of $445 million related to this program, primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification and incorporating changes into LRIP aircraft. During 2018, we recorded additional reach-forward losses of $736 million primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification, flight testing and change incorporation on aircraft, as well as higher than expected effort to meet customer requirements in order to support delivery of the initial aircraft. As with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses and/or delivery delays if we experience further production, technical or quality issues, and delays in flight testing, certification and/or delivery. Export-Import Bank of the United States Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. Certain of our non-U.S. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-U.S. customers. We continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the bank’s board of directors and assist with alternative third party financing sources. Global Trade On June 1, 2018, the U.S. Government began imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several major U.S. trading partners have imposed, or announced their intention to impose, tariffs on U.S. goods. We continue to monitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from these actions. On July 6, 2018, the U.S. and China began imposing tariffs on approximately $34 billion of each other's exports. Certain aircraft parts and components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. Subsequently, the U.S. imposed tariffs on an additional $216 billion in Chinese goods, and China imposed tariffs on an additional $76 billion worth of U.S goods. On December 1, 2018, the U.S. and China agreed to a 90-day timetable to negotiate a resolution to the trade dispute. We continue to monitor the potential for any disruption and adverse revenue and/or cost impacts that may result from these actions or future geopolitical economic developments. The U.S. Government continues to impose and/or threaten to impose sanctions on certain businesses and individuals in Russia. Although our operations or sales in Russia have not been impacted to date, we continue to monitor additional sanctions that may be imposed by the U.S. Government and any responses from Russia that could affect our supply chain, business partners or customers.24Table of ContentsSegment Results of Operations and Financial ConditionCommercial AirplanesBusiness Environment and TrendsAirline Industry Environment Global economic growth, a primary driver for air travel, was above the long-term average of approximately 3% in 2018. Passenger traffic is estimated to grow by 6.5% in 2018, exceeding the long-term average of approximately 5%. While growth was strong across all major world regions, there continues to be variation between regions and airline business models. Airlines operating in Asia Pacific, Europe and North America, as well as low-cost-carriers globally, are currently leading the growth in passenger traffic. Air cargo traffic growth is expected to be between 4.0% and 4.5% in 2018, around the long-term average.Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also focusing on reducing costs and renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes. Net profits in 2018 are expected to approximate $32 billion. The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.7% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.8% average annual GDP growth, we project a $6.3 trillion market for approximately 42,700 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations.Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 88% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers, Embraer and Bombardier, continue to develop and market larger and increasingly more capable airplanes. During 2018, Airbus acquired a majority share of Bombardier’s C Series (now A220) and is in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market, while Embraer’s first E195-E2 delivered in 2018. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Many competitors have continued to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.25Table of ContentsWe are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our cost-reduction efforts, which enhances our ability to compete. We are also focused on taking actions to ensure that Boeing is not harmed by unfair subsidization of competitors.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Revenues$60,715 $58,014 $59,378% of total company revenues60% 62% 64%Earnings from operations$7,879 $5,452 $1,981Operating margins13.0% 9.4% 3.3%Research and development$2,188 $2,247 $3,706Revenues BCA revenues increased by $2,701 million or 5% in 2018 compared with 2017 due to higher 737 and 787 deliveries and favorable 737 and 787 model mix, which more than offset lower 777 and 747 deliveries. BCA revenues decreased by $1,364 million or 2% in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to delivery mix, with fewer twin aisle deliveries more than offsetting the impact of higher single aisle deliveries. Commercial Airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: 737*747†767*777 787Total2018 Cumulative deliveries7,312 1,548 1,133 1,582 781 Deliveries580(18) 6 27(10) 48 1458062017 Cumulative deliveries6,732 1,542 1,106 1,534 636 Deliveries529(17) 14(1) 10 74 1367632016 Cumulative deliveries6,203 1,528 1,096 1,460 500 Deliveries490(19) 9(3) 13 99 137748* Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses† Aircraft accounted for as revenues by BCA and as operating leases in consolidation identified by parenthesesEarnings From Operations Earnings from operations in 2018 increased by $2,427 million compared with 2017. The increase in operating earnings reflects higher revenues and improved operating margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due to higher 787 margins, improved cost performance and favorable delivery mix. Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $3,471 million compared with 2016. The increase in operating earnings and operating margins is primarily due to lower reach-forward losses, lower research and development costs, and improved margins reflecting favorable cost performance, which more than offset the impact of lower revenues. Research and development expense in 2016 reflects the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of $1,235 million related to the fourth and fifth 787 flight test aircraft and higher planned spending related to the 777X program. 26Table of ContentsReach-forward losses of $500 million, $378 million and $772 million were recorded related to the KC-46A Tanker in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. During 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,258 million.Backlog Our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).BCA total backlog of $412,307 million at December 31, 2018 increased from $410,986 million at December 31, 2017, primarily due to net orders in excess of deliveries. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.27Table of ContentsThe following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders.

We delivered the first 737 MAX 8 in May 2017, announced the launch of the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017 and delivered the first 737 MAX 9 in March 2018. The production rate increased from 47 per month to 52 per month in the second quarter of 2018, however the timing of deliveries in 2018 was adversely affected by delays in the supply chain. We continue to plan to increase the production rate to 57 per month in 2019. 747 Program During the fourth quarter of 2018, we received a firm order for 4 new aircraft and increased the accounting quantity by 4 units to 1,574 aircraft. The program accounting quantity now includes aircraft scheduled to be produced through 2022. We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month having reduced the rate from 1.0 per month in September 2016. In 2016, we recorded reach-forward losses of $1,258 million as lower than expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower than expected growth of global freight traffic resulted in lower anticipated revenues from future sales and higher costs to produce fewer airplanes. We continue to evaluate the viability of the 747 program. We believe that a decision to end production of the 747 at the end of the current accounting quantity would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.28Table of Contents767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 24 units during the first quarter of 2018 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. We are currently producing at a rate of 2.5 per month and plan to increase to 3 per month in 2020. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 55 units during 2018 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 5 per month. In 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. 787 Program The accounting quantity for the 787 program increased by 200 units during 2018 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a rate of 12 per month and plan to increase to 14 per month in 2019. We delivered the first 787-10 in March 2018.Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1.0% of total consolidated costs of products and services.Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.Go-ahead and Initial Delivery 737 MAX 72011 2019 737 MAX 82011 2017 737 MAX 92011 2018 737 MAX 10 2017 2020 787-10 2013 2018 777X 2013 2020 Reflects models in development during 2018We launched the 737 MAX 7, 8 and 9 in August 2011 and the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017. We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013.Additional ConsiderationsThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new 29Table of Contentsproduction capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.Defense, Space & Security Business Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment OverviewThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, passed in February 2018, raised the 2011 Budget Control Act spending caps for fiscal years 2018 and 2019 (FY18 and FY19). The consolidated spending bills signed into law in September 2018 provide defense funding for FY19, in compliance with the revised caps. These bills also provide FY19 appropriations for most of the federal government. Full year funding for the departments and agencies not covered by enacted FY19 appropriations, including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), remains uncertain. The unfunded departments and agencies affected by the partial government shutdown (December 22, 2018 through January 25, 2019) are now covered by a Continuing Resolution that extends funding at FY18 levels through February 15, 2019. Congress and the President must agree to FY19 appropriations or an additional Continuing Resolution to fund affected departments and agencies beyond the February 15 deadline in order to prevent a second partial government shutdown. The impact of a partial government shutdown to the Company’s operations would increase as the shutdown continues. There continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including NASA. The 2011 Budget Control Act continues to mandate limits on U.S. government discretionary spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21). The lower budget caps will take effect again in FY20 and FY21 unless Congress acts to raise the spending caps or to repeal or suspend the law. As a result, continued budget uncertainty and the risk of future sequestration cuts remain. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the Company’s operations, financial position and/or cash flows. Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2018, 30% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Revenues$23,195 $20,561 $20,180% of total company revenues23% 22% 22%Earnings from operations$1,594 $2,193 $1,678Operating margins6.9% 10.7% 8.3%30Table of ContentsSince our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues, earnings and backlog may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, including remanufactures and modifications were as follows:Years ended December 31,2018 2017 2016F/A-18 Models17 23 25F-15 Models10 16 15C-17 Globemaster III 4CH-47 Chinook (New)13 9 25CH-47 Chinook (Renewed)17 35 25AH-64 Apache (New) 11 31AH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)23 57 34P-8 Models16 19 18C-40A 1Total96 170 178New-build satellite deliveries were as follows:Years ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Commercial and civil satellites1 3 5Military satellites1 1 2Revenues BDS revenues in 2018 increased by $2,634 million compared with 2017 primarily due to non-US contract awards for fighters, higher weapons revenue, the final C-17 aircraft sale and higher satellites revenue. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments to revenue for 2018 were $214 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting increased unfavorable adjustments on the KC-46A Tanker recorded in 2018.BDS revenues in 2017 increased by $381 million compared with 2016 primarily due to higher weapons revenue. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments to revenue for 2017 were $81 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting decreased unfavorable adjustments on the KC-46A Tanker recorded in 2017. Earnings From Operations BDS earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $599 million compared with 2017 as earnings’ growth from higher revenues was more than offset by charges of $691 million related to winning the T-X Trainer and MQ-25 competitions, as well as $199 million of higher KC-46A Tanker reach-forward losses. Net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments to earnings for 2018 were $315 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year, driven by higher charges on development programs in 2018.31Table of ContentsBDS earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $515 million compared with 2016 primarily due to lower charges on the KC-46A Tanker and Commercial Crew programs. Higher earnings reflect the favorable impact of cumulative catch-up adjustments which were $374 million higher in 2017 than in 2016, primarily driven by lower charges on development programs in 2017.BDS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $147 million, $183 million and $249 million primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.During 2018, 2017 and 2016, BDS recorded charges related to the KC-46A Tanker contract of $222 million, $23 million and $351 million, respectively.BacklogTotal backlog of $57,166 million at December 31, 2018 increased by 30% from $44,049 million at December 31, 2017, primarily due to current year contract awards in many of our programs greater than revenue recognized. Significant orders included Satellites, F/A-18 fighters, Ground-based Midcourse Defense, weapons, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, V-22 Osprey, CH-47 Chinook, MQ-25 Stingray and T-X Trainer.Additional ConsiderationsOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed priced proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, Saudi F-15, USAF KC-46A Tanker, T-X Trainer, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25 Stingray, and commercial and military satellites. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. In the third quarter, we were awarded contracts to develop the T-X Trainer aircraft with complementary devices and the MQ-25 Stingray. We recorded orders of $1,618 million and recognized losses of $691 million associated with these contracts. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues.KC-46A Tanker See the discussion of the KC-46A Tanker program on page 23. United Launch Alliance See the discussion of Indemnifications to ULA and Financing Commitments in Notes 8 and 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Sea Launch See the discussion of the Sea Launch receivables in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Commercial Crew See the discussion of Fixed-Price Development Contracts in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.32Table of ContentsT-X Trainer In September 2018, we were selected by the U.S. Air Force to build the next generation training capability, known as T-X. The program includes aircraft and simulators as well as support and ground equipment. The contract is structured as an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) fixed-price contract with a minimum of 206 aircraft and a maximum of 475 aircraft. The EMD contract is a fixed-price contract valued at $813 million and includes five aircraft and seven simulators, with a period of performance that runs through 2022. The production and support contracts are structured as options that begin with authorization from fiscal year 2022 to 2034. In connection with winning this competition, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $400 million associated with anticipated losses on the options for 346 aircraft that we believe are probable of being exercised. We believe that our investment in this contract positions us for additional market opportunities for both trainer and light attack aircraft.MQ-25 Stingray In August 2018, we were awarded an EMD contract to build the MQ-25 Stingray for the U.S. Navy. The EMD contract is a fixed-price contract that includes development and delivery of four aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $805 million. In connection with winning this competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $291 million. The period of performance runs from 2018 through 2024. The MQ-25 Stingray is the U.S. Navy’s first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft, and we believe that our investment in this contract positions us for long-term leadership in autonomy and artificial intelligence technologies along with additional market opportunities.Global Services Business Environment and TrendsThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics, and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering, and upgrades; training and professional services; and information services. We expect the market to grow by around 3.5% annually. As the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of airplanes. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.Government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability. BGS’ major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 30, which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.33Table of ContentsResults of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Revenues$17,018 $14,581 $13,819% of total company revenues17% 16% 15%Earnings from operations$2,522 $2,246 $2,159Operating margins14.8% 15.4% 15.6%Revenues BGS revenues in 2018 increased by $2,437 million compared with 2017 due to growth across our services portfolio, primarily driven by higher parts revenue including the acquisition of KLX.

A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is related to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.BCC provided customer financing of $601 million and $480 million during 2018 and 2017. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2019 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. However, a number of factors could cause BCC’s new business volume to increase further, including if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, approve new financing transactions. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 1,700 western-built commercial jet aircraft (6.7% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2018, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 2% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2017 and 2016, 8.3% and 8.8% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Revenues$274 $307 $298Earnings from operations$79 $114 $59Operating margins29% 37% 20%Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2018 decreased by $33 million compared with 2017 primarily due to lower lease income driven by a smaller portfolio, partially offset by gain on sale of assets. BCC’s revenues in 2017 were consistent with 2016.Earnings From Operations BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $35 million primarily due to lower revenues. Earnings from operations in 2017 increased by $55 million primarily due to lower asset impairment and depreciation expenses.35Table of ContentsFinancial PositionThe following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31:(Dollars in millions)2018 2017Customer financing and investment portfolio, net$2,790 $3,003Other assets, primarily cash and short-term investments717 677Total assets$3,507 $3,680 Other liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes$523 $653Debt, including intercompany loans2,487 2,523Equity497 504Total liabilities and equity$3,507 $3,680 Debt-to-equity ratio5.0-to-1 5.0-to-1BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2018 decreased from December 31, 2017, primarily due to $812 million of note payoffs, asset sales and portfolio run-off, partially offset by new volume.

We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended.BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow Summary(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2018 2017 2016Net earnings$10,460 $8,458 $5,034Non-cash items2,578 2,636 2,540Changes in working capital2,284 2,252 2,922Net cash provided by operating activities15,322 13,346 10,496Net cash used by investing activities(4,621) (2,058) (3,378)Net cash used by financing activities(11,722) (11,350) (9,587)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(53) 80 (33)Net (decrease) / increase in cash & cash equivalents, including restricted(1,074) 18 (2,502)Cash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at beginning of year8,887 8,869 11,371Cash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at end of year$7,813 $8,887 $8,869Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $15.3 billion during 2018, compared with $13.3 billion during 2017 and $10.5 billion in 2016. The increase of $2.0 billion in 2018 was primarily driven by higher earnings and lower spending on inventory, partially offset by lower advances. The increase of $2.9 billion in 2017 was primarily driven by higher advances more than offsetting inventory increases. 36Table of ContentsAdvances and progress billings increased by $2.6 billion in 2018, increased by $4.7 billion in 2017 and decreased by $1.3 billion in 2016. During 2017, our discretionary contributions to our pension plans included $14.4 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5 billion and $0.5 billion in cash. Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were insignificant in 2018 and 2016. Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities during 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $4.6 billion, $2.1 billion and $3.4 billion primarily due to acquisitions during the second half of 2018 and the timing of investments. Acquisitions net of cash acquired were $3.2 billion in 2018, compared with $0.3 billion in 2017 and 2016. Capital expenditures totaled $1.7 billion in both 2018 and 2017, down from $2.6 billion in 2016. We expect capital expenditures in 2019 to be higher than 2018. Net proceeds from investments was $0.3 billion in 2018 and insignificant in 2017, compared with net contributions to investments of $0.5 billion in 2016. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $11.7 billion during 2018, an increase of $0.4 billion compared with 2017 primarily due to higher dividend payments partially offset by higher net borrowings. Cash used by financing activities was $11.4 billion during 2017, an increase of $1.8 billion compared with 2016, primarily due to higher share repurchases and dividend payments. Net borrowings were $1.4 billion in 2018, $1.1 billion in 2017 and insignificant in 2016.At December 31, 2018 and 2017 the recorded balance of debt was $13.8 billion and $11.1 billion of which $3.2 billion and $1.3 billion was classified as short-term. At December 31, 2018 and 2017 this included $2.5 billion of debt attributable to BCC, of which $0.5 billion and $0.9 billion were classified as short-term.During 2018 and 2017 we repurchased 26.1 million and 46.1 million shares totaling $9.0 billion and $9.2 billion through our open market share repurchase program. In 2018 and 2017, we had 0.7 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2018, the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 17, 2018, totaled $20 billion.Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that serves as a source of short-term liquidity. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, commercial paper borrowings totaling $1,895 million and $600 million, which were supported by unused commitments under the revolving credit agreement. We had no commercial paper borrowings in 2016. At December 31, 2018, we had $5.1 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Financing commitments totaled $19.5 billion and $10.2 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The increase primarily relates to commercial airplane orders received in 2018. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In addition, many of our non-U.S. customers finance aircraft purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. Following the expiration of the bank’s charter on June 30, 2015, the bank’s charter was reauthorized in December 2015. The bank is now authorized through September 30, 2019. However, until the U.S. Senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the bank’s board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. As a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers.In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility 37Table of Contentsto take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings under our commercial paper program or in the debt markets.At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our pension plans were $15.3 billion and $16.4 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) basis our plans are 96% funded at December 31, 2018 with minimal required contributions in 2019. We do not expect to make contributions to our pension plans in 2019. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.At December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2018, and the estimated timing thereof.(Dollars in millions)Total Lessthan 1year 1-3years 3-5years After 5yearsLong-term debt (including current portion)$13,932 $3,137 $1,927 $1,326 $7,542Interest on debt6,458 523 891 752 4,292Pension and other postretirement cash requirements14,379 606 1,627 5,050 7,096Capital lease obligations164 58 75 20 11Operating lease obligations1,850 278 432 291 849Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position126,693 51,784 41,470 22,649 10,790Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position19,900 19,076 716 80 28Total contractual obligations (1)$183,376 $75,462 $47,138 $30,168 $30,608(1) Excludes income tax matters. As of December 31, 2018, our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions of $2,412 million, was $2,392 million. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 38Table of ContentsPurchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, customer financing equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2018, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2018, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $18.4 billion that extend through 2030. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.39Table of ContentsCommercial CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2018.(Dollars in millions)Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3years 4-5years After 5yearsStandby letters of credit and surety bonds$3,761 $1,274 $1,703 $1 $783Commercial aircraft financing commitments19,462 2,331 6,216 5,189 5,726Total commercial commitments$23,223 $3,605 $7,919 $5,190 $6,509Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required, particularly if the Export-Import Bank of the United States continues to be unable to, or does not, provide new financing support. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Contingent ObligationsWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $555 million at December 31, 2018. For additional information, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-GAAP MeasuresCore Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per ShareOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated 40Table of Contentsto BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in earnings during 2018 was a benefit of $1,005 million, largely consistent with a benefit of $1,127 million in 2017 and $1,029 million in 2016. The non-operating pension expense included in Other income/(loss), net was a benefit of $143 million in 2018 and $117 million in 2017, compared with an expense of $327 million in 2016. The benefits in 2018 and 2017 reflect expected returns in excess of interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses. The expense in 2016 reflects the amortization of non-service costs previously capitalized as inventory in prior years, primarily interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses in excess of expected returns.For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on page 21 of this Form 10-K and see Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost, primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.41Table of ContentsReconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP MeasuresThe table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share.

Disclosure is required even if the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. In connection with the U.S. withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (Iran Nuclear Agreement), we engaged in activities during the third quarter that were required to unwind and terminate all agreements with Iranian airlines entered into prior to the withdrawal. These activities were authorized by a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and generated no revenues or profits. In addition, during the fourth quarter Iran Aseman Airlines requested Boeing support, and we replied that the current laws of the United States do not permit Boeing to provide any services, parts, or aircraft without a license from OFAC.Critical Accounting PoliciesAccounting for long-term contractsSubstantially all contracts at BDS, certain military derivative aircraft contracts at BCA and certain contracts at BGS are long-term contracts. Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.Accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2016 net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts decreased Earnings from operations by $190 million and $263 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts increased Earnings from operations by $250 million.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances 43Table of Contentsmay adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all long-term contract performance obligations for all of 2018 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $297 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.Program AccountingProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. For example, in 2016, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $1,258 million on the 747 program. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 and 777X programs, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the Commercial Airplane segment’s 44Table of Contentsoperating margins. For the year ended December 31, 2018, a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our Commercial Airplane segment would have a $607 million impact on operating earnings.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible ImpairmentsWe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2018 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2018, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets.Pension PlansThe majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union employees transitioned to company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.45Table of ContentsThe following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2018.(Dollars in millions)Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bpsPension plans Projected benefit obligation($1,947) $2,408Net periodic pension cost(30) 29Pension cost is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2018 net periodic pension cost by $154 million.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate RiskWe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2018, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2018, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $262 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.46Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:37.570090

We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS), and Global Services (BGS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders. BCA is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, safety, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. BGS provides support for commercial and defense through innovative, comprehensive, and cost-competitive product and service solutions. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.On March 13, 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S. aircraft operators following two fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation authorities have issued directives to the same effect. Deliveries of the 737 MAX have been suspended until clearance is granted by the appropriate regulatory authorities. The grounding is having a significant adverse impact on our operations and creates significant uncertainty. We are focused on safely returning the 737 MAX to service. 19Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations The following table summarizes key indicators of consolidated results of operations:(Dollars in millions, except per share data) Years ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Revenues$76,559 $101,127 $94,005 GAAP (Loss)/earnings from operations($1,975) $11,987 $10,344Operating margins(2.6)% 11.9% 11.0%Effective income tax rate71.8 % 9.9% 16.3%Net (loss)/earnings($636) $10,460 $8,458Diluted (loss)/earnings per share($1.12) $17.85 $13.85 Non-GAAP (1) Core operating (loss)/earnings($3,390) $10,660 $8,906Core operating margins(4.4%) 10.5% 9.5%Core (loss)/earnings per share($3.47) $16.01 $12.33(1)These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense.

Lower BCA revenues are primarily driven by lower 737 MAX deliveries and a revenue reduction of $8,259 million recorded in 2019 for estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions and associated delivery delays related to the 737 MAX grounding, net of insurance recoveries.Revenues increased by $7,122 million in 2018 compared with 2017 due to higher revenues at BCA, BDS, and BGS. BCA revenues increased by $2,887 million due to higher 737 and 787 deliveries and favorable 737 and 787 model mix, which more than offset lower 777 and 747 deliveries. BDS revenues increased by $2,454 million primarily due to non-US contract awards for fighters, higher weapons revenue, the final C-17 aircraft sale and higher satellites revenue. BGS revenues increased by $2,445 million due to higher parts revenue, including the acquisition of KLX, Inc. (KLX) in the fourth quarter of 2018. 20Table of ContentsThe changes in Unallocated items, eliminations and other in 2019, 2018 and 2017 primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries and the sale of aircraft previously leased to customers. Earnings From Operations The following table summarizes Earnings from operations:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Commercial Airplanes($6,657) $7,830 $5,285Defense, Space & Security2,608 1,657 2,383Global Services2,697 2,536 2,251Boeing Capital28 79 114Segment operating (loss)/profit(1,324) 12,102 10,033Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment1,071 1,005 1,127Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment344 322 311Unallocated items, eliminations and other(2,066) (1,442) (1,127)(Loss)/earnings from operations (GAAP)($1,975) $11,987 $10,344FAS/CAS service cost adjustment * (1,415) (1,327) (1,438)Core operating (loss)/earnings (Non-GAAP) **($3,390) $10,660 $8,906*The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. **Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. See page 42.Loss from operations was $1,975 million in 2019 compared with earnings from operations of $11,987 million in 2018. The decrease of $13,962 million is primarily due to a loss from operations at BCA of $6,657 million in 2019 compared to earnings from operations of $7,830 million in 2018, partially offset by higher earnings at BDS and BGS in 2019 compared with 2018. BCA decreased by $14,487 million due to lower 737 deliveries and the earnings charge for the 737 MAX grounding of $8,259 million, net of insurance recoveries. BDS earnings from operations increased by $951 million primarily due to lower charges in 2019 for development programs. BGS earnings from operations increased by $161 million primarily due to higher revenues, which was partially offset by less favorable performance and mix. Earnings from operations increased by $1,643 million in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BGS, which more than offset the decrease at BDS and the change in Unallocated items, eliminations and other. BCA earnings from operations increased by $2,545 million due to higher revenues and improved operating margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due to higher 787 margins, improved cost performance and favorable delivery mix. BGS earnings from operations increased by $285 million primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher period costs. BDS earnings from operations decreased by $726 million as earnings growth from higher revenues was more than offset by charges of $691 million related to winning the T-7A Red Hawk and MQ-25 competitions, as well as higher KC-46A Tanker reach-forward losses. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program of $148 million, $736 million, and $445 million, respectively. Core operating earnings decreased by $14,050 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to a loss from operations at BCA in 2019, partially offset by higher earnings at BDS and BGS.21Table of ContentsCore operating earnings increased by $1,754 million in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to higher earnings at BCA and BGS, partially offset by lower earnings at BDS and higher unallocated expenses.Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Share-based plans($65) ($76) ($77)Deferred compensation(174) (19) (240)Amortization of previously capitalized interest(89) (92) (96)Research and development expense, net(384) (132) 42Customer financing impairment(250) Litigation (109) (148) Eliminations and other unallocated items(995) (975) (756)Unallocated items, eliminations and other($2,066) ($1,442) ($1,127)Deferred compensation expense increased by $155 million in 2019 and decreased by $221 million in 2018, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price.Research and development expense increased by $252 million in 2019 and increased by $174 million in 2018 primarily due to spending by Boeing NeXt on product development.In 2019, we recorded a $250 million charge related to the impairment of lease incentives with one customer that experienced liquidity issues, and a $109 million charge related to ongoing litigation associated with recoverable costs on U.S. government contracts. In 2018, we recorded a $148 million charge related to the outcome of the Spirit litigation. Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $20 million in 2019 and $219 million in 2018 primarily due to timing of expense allocations. Net periodic pension benefit costs included in Earnings from operations were as follows:(Dollars in millions)PensionYears ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Allocated to business segments($1,384) ($1,318) ($1,637)Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment1,071 1,005 1,127Net periodic benefit cost included in (Loss)/earnings from operations($313) ($313) ($510)The pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in Earnings from operations in 2019, 2018, and 2017 was largely consistent across all periods. The net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations in 2019 was consistent with 2018, as reductions in current year service cost were offset by higher amortization of prior year service costs. The decrease in net periodic benefit cost included in Earnings from operations in 2018 compared to 2017 was primarily due to a lower portion of service cost recognized in Earnings from operations.For additional discussion related to Postretirement Plans, see Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.22Table of ContentsOther Earnings Items(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2019 2018 2017(Loss)/earnings from operations($1,975) $11,987 $10,344Other income, net438 92 123Interest and debt expense(722) (475) (360)(Loss)/earnings before income taxes(2,259) 11,604 10,107Income tax benefit/(expense)1,623 (1,144) (1,649)Net (loss)/earnings from continuing operations($636) $10,460 $8,458Other income, net increased by $346 million in 2019 primarily due to higher non-operating pension income. Other income, net decreased by $31 million in 2018 primarily due to lower gains from foreign exchange, partially offset by higher interest income. The non-operating pension income included in Other income, net was $374 million in 2019, $143 million in 2018, and $117 million in 2017. The increased income in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to lower amortization of actuarial losses, partially offset by decreases in expected return on assets and increases in interest cost. The increase in 2018 compared to 2017 was due to decreases in interest cost and increases in estimated return on assets, partially offset by higher amortization of actuarial losses.Interest and debt expense increased by $247 million in 2019 and increased by $115 million in 2018 as a result of higher debt balances.For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. For long-term contracts, the amount reported as cost of sales is recognized as incurred. Substantially all contracts at our BDS segment and certain contracts at our BGS segment are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Costs on these contracts are recorded as incurred. Cost of sales for commercial spare parts is recorded at average cost.The following table summarizes cost of sales:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 312019 2018Change 2018 2017ChangeCost of sales$72,093 $81,490($9,397) $81,490 $76,612$4,878Cost of sales as a % of revenues94.2% 80.6%13.6% 80.6% 81.5%(0.9)%Cost of sales decreased by $9,397 million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to lower revenue and lower reach-forward losses. Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues increased in 2019 primarily due to the 737 MAX grounding. Cost of sales increased by $4,878 million in 2018 compared with 2017, primarily due to higher revenue and higher reach-forward losses.23Table of ContentsResearch and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Commercial Airplanes$1,956 $2,188 $2,247Defense, Space & Security758 788 834Global Services121 161 140Other384 132 (42)Total$3,219 $3,269 $3,179Research and development expense decreased by $50 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower spending on 777X and 737 MAX, partially offset by higher spending by BCA and Boeing NeXt on product development.Research and development expense increased by $90 million in 2018 compared with 2017 due to investment in product development, partially offset by lower spending on 777X and 787-10.BacklogOur backlog at December 31 was as follows:(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2019 2018Commercial Airplanes$376,593 $408,140Defense, Space & Security63,908 61,277Global Services22,902 21,064Total Backlog$463,403 $490,481 Contractual backlog$436,473 $462,070Unobligated backlog26,930 $28,411Total Backlog$463,403 $490,481Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2019 was primarily due to BCA deliveries in excess of new orders and a reduction in backlog related to orders from a customer that experienced liquidity issues, partially offset by BDS current year contract awards in excess of revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior yearsUnobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2019 was primarily due to reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS and BGS contracts partially offset by contract awards.Additional ConsiderationsExport-Import Bank of the United States Many of our non-U.S. customers finance purchases through the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The bank is authorized through December 31, 2026. 24Table of ContentsGlobal Trade We continually monitor the global trade environment for changes in tariffs, trade agreements, sanctions or other potential geopolitical economic developments that may impact the company. Beginning in June 2018, the U.S. Government has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several major U.S. trading partners have imposed, or announced their intention to impose, tariffs on U.S. goods. In May 2019, the U.S. Government, Mexico and Canada reached an agreement to end the steel and aluminum tariffs between these countries. Passage of the U.S./Mexico/Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA) will also result in lower tariffs. We continue to monitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from the remaining global tariffs.Since 2018, the U.S. and China imposed tariffs on approximately $34 billion of each other's exports in July 2018. Certain aircraft parts and components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. Subsequently, the U.S. imposed tariffs on an additional $216 billion in Chinese goods, and China imposed tariffs on an additional $76 billion worth of U.S goods. The U.S. and China Phase I agreement in January 2020 is a positive development for overall trade with China. Negotiations to resolve remaining trade issues continue.Overall global trade tensions and increased market uncertainty have resulted in fewer orders than anticipated for our commercial aircraft. The U.S. Government continues to impose and/or consider imposing sanctions on certain businesses and individuals in Russia. Although our operations or sales in Russia have not been impacted to date, we continue to monitor additional sanctions that may be imposed by the U.S. Government and any responses from Russia that could affect our supply chain, business partners or customers.Segment Results of Operations and Financial ConditionCommercial AirplanesBusiness Environment and TrendsAirline Industry Environment Global economic growth, a primary driver for air travel, was 2.6% in 2019, slightly below the long-term average of approximately 3%. Passenger traffic is estimated to grow by 4% to 5% in 2019, close to the long-term average of approximately 5%. The grounding of the 737 MAX and suspension of 737 MAX deliveries has slowed growth at certain airlines. While growth was solid across most major world regions, there continues to be variation between regions and airline business models. Despite some moderation in the growth rates, airlines operating in Asia Pacific and Europe, as well as low-cost-carriers globally, are leading the 2019 growth in passenger traffic. Air cargo traffic growth is expected to contract this year due to weak global trade growth.Airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. Airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. Airlines are also focusing on reducing costs and renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes. Net profits in 2019 are expected to approximate $26 billion. The long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.6% per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.7% average annual GDP growth, we project a $6.8 trillion market for approximately 44,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations.25Table of ContentsIndustry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe, the Middle East and Asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 80% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. The grounding of the 737 MAX and the associated suspension of 737 MAX deliveries have significantly reduced our market share with respect to deliveries of single aisle aircraft in 2019 and may provide competitors with an opportunity to obtain more orders and increase market share. We are continuing to monitor the impact of the 737 MAX grounding on our suppliers and working to ensure that our supply chain can support our production plans once production resumes. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. After the acquisition of a majority share of Bombardier’s C Series (now A220) in 2018, Airbus continues to expand in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are developing commercial jet aircraft. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Many competitors have continued to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.We are focused on safely returning the 737 MAX to service, improving our products and services and continuing our cost-reduction efforts, which enhances our ability to compete. We are also focused on taking actions to ensure that Boeing is not harmed by unfair subsidization of competitors.26Table of ContentsResults of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Revenues$32,255 $57,499 $54,612% of total company revenues42% 57% 58%(Loss)/earnings from operations($6,657) $7,830 $5,285Operating margins(20.6)% 13.6% 9.7%Research and development$1,956 $2,188 $2,247Revenues BCA revenues decreased by $25,244 million in 2019 compared with 2018 driven by lower 737 MAX deliveries and a revenue reduction of $8,259 million that was recorded in 2019 for estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions and associated delivery delays related to the 737 MAX grounding, net of $500 million of insurance recoveries. BCA revenues increased by $2,887 million in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to higher 737 and 787 deliveries and favorable 737 and 787 model mix, which more than offset lower 777 and 747 deliveries. The 737 MAX grounding will continue to have a significant impact on revenues until deliveries resume.Commercial Airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: 737*747†767*777†787Total2019 Cumulative deliveries7,439 1,555 1,176 1,627 939 Deliveries127(19) 7 43(23) 45(2) 1583802018 Cumulative deliveries7,312 1,548 1,133 1,582 781 Deliveries580(18) 6 27(10) 48 1458062017 Cumulative deliveries6,732 1,542 1,106 1,534 636 Deliveries529(17) 14(1) 10 74 136763* Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses† Aircraft accounted for as revenues by BCA and as operating leases in consolidation identified by parenthesesLoss/Earnings From Operations BCA loss from operations was $6,657 million in 2019 compared with earnings from operations of $7,830 million in 2018. The decrease of $14,487 million is primarily due to lower 737 deliveries and earnings charges related to the 737 MAX. The 737 MAX grounding and associated changes to our production rate will continue to adversely impact 737 program and overall BCA margins.BCA earnings from operations increased by $2,545 million in 2018 compared with 2017. The increase in operating earnings reflects higher revenues and improved operating margins. The increase in operating margins is primarily due to higher 787 margins, improved cost performance and favorable delivery mix. 27Table of ContentsBacklog Our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606).BCA total backlog of $376,593 million at December 31, 2019 decreased from $408,140 million at December 31, 2018, primarily due to deliveries in excess of new orders and a reduction in backlog related to orders from a customer that experienced liquidity issues. We are experiencing fewer new 737 MAX orders than we were receiving prior to the grounding. If 737 MAX aircraft remain grounded for an extended period of time, we may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations. To date, the 737 MAX grounding has not resulted in significant order cancellations. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.28Table of ContentsThe following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31.

Program Highlights737 Program See the discussion of the 737 MAX Grounding and 737NG Structure (Pickle Fork) in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.747 Program We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month. We believe that ending production of the 747 at the end of the current accounting quantity would not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.767 Program The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the tanker program. We are increasing our combined production rate from 2.5 to 3 per month in 2020. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 10 units during 2019 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. In 2013, we launched the 777X, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. We have experienced issues in engine design and development on the 777X. The first flight of the 777X was completed on January 25, 2020, and first delivery is targeted for 2021. The 777 and 777X programs have a combined production rate of 5 per month. We plan to produce more 777 models and fewer 777X models in the near term than previously planned. We expect to deliver at an average rate of 3 per month in 2020. The 777X will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery. 787 Program At the end of the first quarter of 2019, we increased the production rate from 12 per month to 14 per month. As a result of fewer orders than anticipated, we plan to reduce the 787 production rate to 12 per month in late 2020 and to 10 per month in early 2021. We plan to return to a production rate of 12 per month in 2023. 29Table of ContentsFleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.Go-ahead and Initial Delivery 737 MAX 72011 2020 737 MAX 82011 2017 737 MAX 92011 2018 737 MAX 10 2017 2021 787-10 2013 2018 777X 2013 2021 Reflects models in development during 2019We launched the 737 MAX 7, 8 and 9 in August 2011 and the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017. We launched the 787-10 in June 2013 and the 777X in November 2013.Additional ConsiderationsThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.Defense, Space & Security Business Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment OverviewThe Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 raised the Budget Control Act limits on federal discretionary defense and non-defense spending for fiscal years 2020 and 2021 (FY20 and FY21), reducing budget uncertainty 30Table of Contentsand the risk of sequestration. The consolidated appropriations acts for FY20, enacted in December 2019, provided FY20 appropriations for government departments and agencies, including the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA).The enacted FY20 appropriations included funding for Boeing’s major programs, such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15EX, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Tanker, P-8 Poseidon and Space Launch System. However, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including NASA. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows. Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2019, 29% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Revenues$26,227 $26,392 $23,938% of total company revenues34% 26% 25%Earnings from operations$2,608 $1,657 $2,383Operating margins9.9% 6.3% 10.0%Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues, earnings and backlog may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.31Table of ContentsDeliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, including remanufactures and modifications were as follows:Years ended December 31,2019 2018 2017F/A-18 Models23 17 23F-15 Models11 10 16C-17 Globemaster III1 CH-47 Chinook (New)13 13 9CH-47 Chinook (Renewed)22 17 35AH-64 Apache (New)37 11AH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)74 23 57KC-46 Tanker28 P-8 Models18 16 19C-40A2 Total229 96 170New-build satellite deliveries were as follows:Years ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Commercial and civil satellites2 1 3Military satellites 1 1Revenues BDS revenues in 2019 decreased by $165 million compared with 2018 due to timing associated with non-U.S. contract awards for fighters and the final C-17 sale in 2018, lower revenue related to charges on Commercial Crew, and lower volume from certain unmanned and vertical lift programs. These reductions were partially offset by increases from new programs, including E-7 early warning aircraft, VC-25B, T-7A Red Hawk, and MQ-25, as well as from satellites and weapons. The unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019 was $163 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting unfavorable adjustments on the Commercial Crew contract and less favorable performance.BDS revenues in 2018 increased by $2,454 million compared with 2017 primarily due to non-US contract awards for fighters, higher weapons revenue, the final C-17 aircraft sale and higher satellites revenue. The unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2018 was $359 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting increased unfavorable adjustments on the KC-46A Tanker recorded in 2018.Earnings From Operations BDS earnings from operations in 2019 increased by $951 million compared with 2018 primarily due to lower net charges on development programs. In 2019, BDS recorded charges of $143 million compared with $722 million in 2018 related to the KC-46A Tanker contract. Also during 2019, BDS recorded charges of $489 million compared with $57 million in 2018 related to the Commercial Crew contract. In 2018, we recorded charges of $691 million related to losses on the T-7A Red Hawk and MQ-25 contracts. The unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019 was $62 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year, reflecting lower net unfavorable adjustments on development programs.BDS earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $726 million compared with 2017 as earnings growth from higher revenues was more than offset by the higher charges on development programs in 2018. In 32Table of Contents2017, BDS recorded charges of $401 million related to the KC-46A Tanker contract. The unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2018 was $412 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year, driven by higher charges on development programs in 2018.BDS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $128 million, $147 million and $183 million primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.BacklogTotal backlog of $63,908 million at December 31, 2019 increased by 4% from $61,277 million at December 31, 2018, primarily due to current year contract awards in many of our programs greater than revenue recognized. Significant orders included F/A-18 fighters, Space Launch System, P-8A Poseidon, KC-46A Tanker, and E-7 Airborne Early Warning & Control, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years. Additional ConsiderationsOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed priced proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B Presidential Aircraft, MQ-25, and commercial and military satellites. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues.KC-46A Tanker The KC-46A Tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. In 2011, we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver next generation aerial refueling tankers. The contract contains production options for both low rate initial production (LRIP) aircraft and full rate production aircraft. Since 2016, the USAF has authorized five LRIP lots for a total of 67 aircraft. The Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) contract and the five authorized LRIP lots are valued at approximately $15 billion. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. In January 2019, we delivered the first KC-46A to the USAF, and by December 2019, we had delivered a total of 28 aircraft. During 2017, we recorded reach-forward losses of $445 million related to this program, primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification and incorporating changes into LRIP aircraft. During 2018, we recorded additional reach-forward losses of $736 million primarily reflecting higher estimated costs associated with certification, flight testing and change incorporation on aircraft, as well as higher than expected effort to meet customer requirements in order to support delivery of the initial aircraft. During 2019, we recorded additional reach-forward losses of $148 million reflecting higher manufacturing costs. 33Table of ContentsAs with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses and/or delivery delays if we experience further production, technical or quality issues. Commercial Crew NASA has contracted us to design and build the CST-100 Starliner spacecraft to transport crews to the International Space Station. On December 20, 2019 the Starliner launched and successfully landed two days later completing an abbreviated uncrewed flight test that performed many mission objectives before returning to Earth as the first orbital land touchdown of a human-rated capsule in U.S. history. The flight test was abbreviated, however, because anomalies experienced during the mission prevented docking with the International Space Station. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we recorded an increase to the reach-forward loss of $410 million, primarily to provision for another uncrewed mission. Root cause analysis is underway and NASA is evaluating the data received during the mission to determine if another uncrewed mission is required. T-7A Red Hawk In September 2018, we were selected by the USAF to build the next generation training capability, known as T-7A Red Hawk (formerly T-X Trainer). The program includes aircraft and simulators as well as support and ground equipment. The contract is structured as an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity fixed-price contract with a minimum of 206 aircraft and a maximum of 475 aircraft. The EMD contract is a fixed-price contract valued at $813 million and includes five aircraft and seven simulators, with a period of performance that runs through 2022. The production and support contracts are structured as options that begin with authorization from fiscal year 2022 to 2034. In connection with winning this competition in 2018, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $400 million associated with anticipated losses on the options for 346 aircraft that we believe are probable of being exercised. During 2019, we completed the aircraft’s critical design review. We believe that our investment in this contract positions us for additional market opportunities for both trainer and light attack aircraft.MQ-25 In August 2018, we were awarded an EMD contract to build the MQ-25 for the U.S. Navy. The EMD contract is a fixed-price contract that includes development and delivery of four aircraft and test articles at a contract price of $805 million. In connection with winning this competition, we recognized a reach-forward loss of $291 million. The period of performance runs from 2018 through 2024. In 2019, we conducted a successful first flight. The MQ-25 is the U.S. Navy’s first operational carrier-based unmanned aircraft, and we believe that our investment in this contract positions us for long-term leadership in autonomy and artificial intelligence technologies along with additional market opportunities.United Launch Alliance See the discussion of Indemnifications to ULA and Financing Commitments in Notes 7 and 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Sea Launch See the discussion of the Sea Launch receivables in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Global Services Business Environment and TrendsThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics, and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering, and upgrades; training and professional services; and information services. We expect the market to grow by around 3.5% annually. As the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of airplanes. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.34Table of ContentsGovernment services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability. BGS’ major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 30, which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Revenues$18,468 $17,056 $14,611% of total company revenues24% 17% 16%Earnings from operations$2,697 $2,536 $2,251Operating margins14.6% 14.9% 15.4%Revenues BGS revenues in 2019 increased by $1,412 million compared with 2018 due to the acquisition of KLX in the fourth quarter of 2018 and government services revenue, partially offset by lower commercial services revenue. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019 was $80 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year.BGS revenues in 2018 increased by $2,445 million compared with 2017 due to growth across our services portfolio, primarily driven by higher parts revenue, including the acquisition of KLX. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2018 was $63 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year.Earnings From Operations BGS earnings from operations in 2019 increased by $161 million compared with 2018. The increase in earnings from operations reflects higher revenues, which was partially offset by less favorable performance and mix. Earnings from operations for 2019 also includes a divestiture gain of $395 million and a charge of $293 million related to our decision in the fourth quarter to retire the Aviall brand and trade name. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019 was $21 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year.BGS earnings from operations in 2018 increased by $285 million compared with 2017 primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by higher period costs. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2018 was $25 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year.35Table of ContentsBacklogBGS total backlog of $22,902 million at December 31, 2019 increased by 9% from $21,064 million at December 31, 2018, primarily due to current year contract awards, partially offset by revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.Boeing CapitalBusiness Environment and TrendsBCC’s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 totaled $2,254 million. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is related to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.BCC provided customer financing of $419 million and $601 million during 2019 and 2018. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2020 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,200 western-built commercial jet aircraft (8.5% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2019, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 20% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2018 and 2017, 6.7% and 8.3% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Revenues$244 $274 $307Earnings from operations$28 $79 $114Operating margins11% 29% 37%Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2019 decreased by $30 million compared with 2018 primarily due to lower gains on the sale of assets. BCC’s revenues in 2018 decreased by $33 million compared with 2017 primarily due to lower lease income driven by a smaller portfolio, partially offset by gains on asset sales.Earnings From Operations BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2019 decreased by $51 million primarily due to lower revenues and higher asset impairment expenses. Earnings from operations in 2018 decreased by $35 million primarily due to lower revenues.36Table of ContentsFinancial PositionThe following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31:(Dollars in millions)2019 2018Customer financing and investment portfolio, net$2,251 $2,790Other assets, primarily cash and short-term investments535 717Total assets$2,786 $3,507 Other liabilities, primarily deferred income taxes$432 $523Debt, including intercompany loans1,960 2,487Equity394 497Total liabilities and equity$2,786 $3,507 Debt-to-equity ratio5.0-to-1 5.0-to-1BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2019 decreased from December 31, 2018, primarily due to $720 million of note payoffs and portfolio run-off and $250 million related to the impairment of lease incentives, partially offset by new volume. BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment. The $250 million impairment of lease incentives did not result in an earnings charge in the BCC segment because of an intercompany guarantee. Leased aircraft with a carrying value of approximately $58 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2020. We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow Summary(Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31,2019 2018 2017Net (loss)/earnings($636) $10,460 $8,458Non-cash items2,819 2,578 2,636Changes in working capital(4,629) 2,284 2,252Net cash (used)/provided by operating activities(2,446) 15,322 13,346Net cash used by investing activities(1,530) (4,621) (2,058)Net cash provided/(used) by financing activities5,739 (11,722) (11,350)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(5) (53) 80Net increase/(decrease) in cash & cash equivalents, including restricted1,758 (1,074) 18Cash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at beginning of year7,813 8,887 8,869Cash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at end of year$9,571 $7,813 $8,887Operating Activities Net cash used by operating activities was $2.4 billion during 2019, compared with net cash provided by operating activities of $15.3 billion during 2018 and $13.3 billion in 2017. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2019 primarily reflects the impacts of the 737 MAX grounding that is resulting 37Table of Contentsin lower earnings, higher inventory and lower advances and progress payments. In addition, compensation payments to 737 MAX customers of $1.2 billion for disruption to their operations also reduced 2019 cash from operating activities. Cash used to fund Inventory was $12.4 billion during 2019 as we continued to produce aircraft while deliveries were suspended. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $0.7 billion in 2019, as compared with $2.6 billion in 2018. In December 2019, we announced plans to temporarily suspend production of the 737 MAX beginning in January 2020. This will enable us to prioritize the delivery of stored aircraft. Net cash from operating activities in future quarters is expected to continue to be adversely impacted by the 737 MAX grounding.Discretionary contributions to our pension plans were insignificant in 2019 and 2018. During 2017, our discretionary contributions to our pension plans included 14.4 million shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $3.5 billion and $0.5 billion in cash. Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities during 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $1.5 billion, $4.6 billion and $2.1 billion. The reduction in 2019 compared with 2018 is primarily due to acquisitions completed in the second half of 2018 and the timing of investments. Acquisitions net of cash acquired were $0.5 billion in 2019, compared with $3.2 billion in 2018, primarily related to the acquisition of KLX. Proceeds from dispositions was $0.5 billion in 2019 as a result of the divestiture of two businesses. Capital expenditures totaled $1.8 billion in 2019, relatively consistent with $1.7 billion in 2018 and 2017. We expect capital expenditures in 2020 to be relatively consistent with 2019. Net proceeds from investments was $0.1 billion in 2019, $0.3 billion in 2018, and was insignificant in 2017. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $5.7 billion during 2019, compared with cash used by financing activities of $11.7 billion in 2018. The increase of $17.5 billion compared with 2018 primarily reflects higher net borrowings and lower share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividend payments in 2019. Cash used by financing activities was $11.7 billion during 2018, an increase of $0.4 billion compared with 2017, primarily due to higher dividend payments partially offset by higher net borrowings. Net borrowings were $13.2 billion in 2019, $1.4 billion in 2018 and $1.1 billion in 2017.At December 31, 2019 and 2018 the recorded balance of debt was $27.3 billion and $13.8 billion of which $7.3 billion and $3.2 billion was classified as short-term. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 this included $2.0 billion and $2.5 billion of debt attributable to BCC, of which $0.5 billion and $0.5 billion were classified as short-term.During 2019 and 2018 we repurchased 6.9 million and 26.1 million shares totaling $2.7 billion and $9.0 billion through our open market share repurchase program. In 2019 and 2018, we had 0.6 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. At December 31, 2019, the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on December 17, 2018, totaled $17.3 billion. Share repurchases under this plan are currently suspended. We increased our quarterly dividend from $1.71 to $2.055 in December 2018, which resulted in $684 million of higher dividend payments in 2019 compared with 2018. Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We have a commercial paper program that serves as a source of short-term liquidity. At December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, commercial paper borrowings totaling $6,109 million, $1,895 million and $600 million, respectively, which were supported by unused commitments under the revolving credit agreement. At December 31, 2019, we had $9.6 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Customer financing commitments totaled $13.4 billion and $19.5 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018. The decrease primarily relates to financing commitment expirations and terminations. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been 38Table of Contentsrequired to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. As previously announced, we plan to acquire an 80% ownership stake in a joint venture comprised of the commercial aircraft and services operations of Embraer for $4.2 billion. We expect the transaction to close in the first half of 2020.In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, including impacts related to the 737 MAX grounding, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings under our commercial paper program or in the debt markets.As of January 31, 2020, we have received commitments from a syndicate of banks sufficient for us to enter into a $12 billion delayed draw two-year term loan credit facility. This facility may be increased at the Company’s option if the facility is oversubscribed. The facility will enhance our liquidity and is expected to close in February 2020. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, our pension plans were $15.9 billion and $15.3 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2019. We do not expect to make significant contributions to our pension plans in 2020. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.At December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.39Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2019, and the estimated timing thereof.(Dollars in millions)Total Lessthan 1year 1-3years 3-5years After 5yearsLong-term debt (including current portion)$27,476 $7,306 $2,698 $1,780 $15,692Interest on debt12,408 803 1,479 1,341 8,785Pension and other postretirement cash requirements9,717 621 1,307 3,719 4,070Finance lease obligations238 71 98 26 43Operating lease obligations1,574 287 429 249 609Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position115,411 52,685 33,550 19,246 9,930Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position22,315 20,867 1,423 3 22Acquisition not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position (2)4,200 4,200 Total contractual obligations (1)$193,339 $86,840 $40,984 $26,364 $39,151(1) Excludes income tax matters. As of December 31, 2019, our net liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions of $1,409 million, was $1,262 million. Aside from $670 million of income taxes payable expected to be paid in 2020, we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining net liability for income taxes payable. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) We plan to acquire an 80% ownership stake in a joint venture comprised of the commercial aircraft and services operations of Embraer. For additional information, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. 40Table of ContentsPurchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, customer financing equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2019, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2019, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $24.8 billion that extend through 2034. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.Commercial CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2019.(Dollars in millions)Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3years 4-5years After 5yearsStandby letters of credit and surety bonds$3,769 $1,657 $1,224 $180 $708Commercial aircraft financing commitments13,377 3,506 4,324 3,570 1,977Total commercial commitments$17,146 $5,163 $5,548 $3,750 $2,685Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.41Table of ContentsContingent ObligationsWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $570 million at December 31, 2019. For additional information, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-GAAP MeasuresCore Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per ShareOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in (loss)/earnings from operations during 2019 was a benefit of $1,071 million, largely consistent with a benefit of $1,005 million in 2018 and $1,127 million in 2017. The non-operating pension expense included in Other income, net was a benefit of $374 million in 2019, $143 million in 2018 and $117 million in 2017. The benefits in 2019, 2018, and 2017 reflect expected returns in excess of interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on page 22 of this Form 10-K and see Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated 42Table of Contentspension and other postretirement benefit cost, primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP MeasuresThe table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share.

Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.Accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts decreased Earnings from operations by $111 million and $190 million. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts increased Earnings from operations by $250 million.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all long-term contract performance obligations for all of 2019 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $330 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.44Table of ContentsProgram AccountingProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 777X program, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. In addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. If the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have an approximately $400 million impact on operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2019.737 MAX GroundingOn March 13, 2019, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) issued an order to suspend operations of all 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. and by U.S. aircraft operators following two fatal 737 MAX accidents. Non-U.S. civil aviation authorities have issued directives to the same effect. The grounding is having a significant adverse impact on our operations and creates significant uncertainty.45Table of ContentsMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the March 10, 2019 accident of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. Further, we are fully cooperating with all ongoing governmental and regulatory investigations and inquiries relating to the accidents and the 737 MAX, including investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that may result given the ongoing status of these lawsuits, investigations, and inquiries. We have also experienced claims and/or assertions from customers and suppliers in connection with the grounding. As a result of the grounding, we reduced the 737 production rate from 52 per month to 42 per month in 2019 and in December 2019, we announced plans to temporarily suspend 737 production beginning in January 2020. We have concluded that the suspension of production and the gradual resumption of production at low production rates will result in abnormal production costs which will be expensed when incurred rather than inventoried. Prior to the grounding, we had planned to increase the production rate to 57 per month in 2019.In the preparation of our financial statements, we have made assumptions regarding outcomes of accident investigations and other government inquiries, timing and conditions of return to service, the duration of the 737 MAX production suspension and timing of future 737 production rate increases, supplier readiness to support production rate changes, timing and sequence of future customer deliveries as well as outcomes of negotiations with customers impacted by the grounding. We have also made significant assumptions regarding estimated costs expected to be incurred in 2020 and 2021 that should be included in program inventory and those costs that should be expensed when incurred as abnormal production costs. While these assumptions reflect our best estimate at this time, they are highly uncertain and significantly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements.The FAA and other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities will determine the timing and conditions of the 737 MAX return to service in each relevant jurisdiction. We have assumed that regulatory approval of the 737 MAX will enable deliveries to resume during mid-2020. We have also assumed that, as a condition of return to service, regulators will require 737 MAX pilots to undergo computer and simulator training. We have assumed that we will resume 737 MAX aircraft production at low rates in 2020 as timing and conditions of return to service are better understood, and then we expect to gradually increase to previously planned production rates over the next few years. We are also assuming that 737 MAX airplanes produced during the grounding and included within inventory will be delivered over several quarters with the majority of them delivering during the first year after the resumption of deliveries. The cumulative impacts of changes to assumptions regarding timing of return to service and timing of planned production rates have increased the estimated costs to produce aircraft included in the current accounting quantity by approximately $6.3 billion, which will be recorded in program inventory. In addition, the suspension of 737 MAX production and lower production rates is expected to result in approximately $4.0 billion of abnormal production costs in 2020 and 2021 that will be expensed as incurred. The increases in the estimated costs accounted for as program inventory will reduce 737 program and overall BCA segment operating margins in future periods after deliveries resume. Production costs incurred while production is suspended and a portion of production costs incurred while we gradually increase production rates to a normal level will be expensed as incurred as abnormal costs and will not be included in program inventory. We may face additional costs, delays in regulatory approval of the 737 MAX and/or the resumption of deliveries, and/or further delays in planned production rate increases which may result in further increases in program costs and/or abnormal production costs.We recorded an earnings charge and corresponding liability of $6.1 billion, in the second quarter of 2019, in connection with an estimate of potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions related to the 737 MAX grounding and associated delivery delays. The second quarter estimate of $6.1 billion was updated in the third and fourth quarters of 2019. The remaining liability of $7.4 billion at December 31, 2019 represents our current best estimate of future concessions and other considerations we expect to provide to customers. This estimate relies on the exercise of judgment by management and is significantly impacted by the assumptions described above, as well as the status of negotiations with 46Table of Contentsour customers. Any delays in our ability to resume deliveries, prolonged production suspension, further disruptions to our production system, supplier claims or assertions, or changes to estimated concessions and other considerations we expect to provide to customers could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible ImpairmentsWe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2019 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2019, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. As of December 31, 2018, we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. During 2019, we changed the name of the Aviall business to Boeing Distribution Inc. and, in the fourth quarter, decided to retire the Aviall brand and trade name. As a result we recorded an earnings charge of $293 million to write-off the Aviall indefinite-lived intangible asset. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2019, we had an indefinite-lived intangible asset with a carrying value of $197 million related to the Jeppesen brand and trade name. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of the Jeppesen indefinite-lived intangible asset.47Table of ContentsPension PlansThe majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union employees transitioned to company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2019.(Dollars in millions)Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bpsPension plans Projected benefit obligation($2,231) $2,778Net periodic pension cost(10) 20Pension cost is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2019 net periodic pension cost by $149 million.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate RiskWe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. As of December 31, 2019, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2019, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $226 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.48Table of ContentsCommodity Price RiskWe are subject to commodity price risk relating to commodity purchase contracts for items used in production that are subject to changes in the market price. We use commodity swaps to hedge against these potentially unfavorable price changes. Our commodity purchase contracts and derivatives are both sensitive to changes in the market price. At December 31, 2019, a 10% increase or decrease in the market price in our commodity derivatives would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $63 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of market price fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these commodity purchase contracts and the offsetting swaps do not create material market risk.49Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:29.432033
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations and Financial ConditionOverviewWe are a global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS), and Global Services (BGS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders. BCA is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, safety, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. BGS provides support for commercial and defense through innovative, comprehensive, and cost-competitive product and service solutions. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.Business Environment and TrendsThe global outbreak of COVID-19 and the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding continue to have significant adverse impacts on our business and are expected to continue to negatively impact revenue, earnings and operating cash flow in future quarters. They are also having a significant impact on our liquidity - see Liquidity Matters in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of liquidity and additional actions we are taking in response to these challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel, creating a tremendous challenge for our customers, our business and the entire commercial aerospace manufacturing and services sector. Global economic growth, a primary driver for air travel, is expected to have declined to between -4% and -5% in 2020. The latest International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecast projected full-year 2020 passenger traffic to be down more than 60% compared to 2019 as global economic activity slows due to COVID-19, and governments severely restricted travel to contain the spread of the virus. The recovery remains slow and uneven as travel restrictions and varying regional travel protocols continue to impact air travel. Generally, we expect domestic travel to recover faster than international travel. As a result, we expect the narrow-body market to recover faster than the wide-body market. Also, the pace of the commercial market recovery will be heavily dependent on COVID-19 infection rates, progress on testing, government travel restrictions, and timing and availability of a vaccine. Air cargo traffic levels contracted this year due to weak global trade growth and capacity limitations given the large impact that COVID-19 has had on international passenger operations, which also carry cargo. Demand for dedicated freighters is developing better relative to cargo traffic trends. 24Table of ContentsAirline financial performance, which also plays a role in the demand for new capacity, has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to IATA, net losses in 2020 for the airline industry are expected to be approximately $118 billion, compared to net profits of $26 billion in 2019. Our customers are taking actions to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the market by preserving liquidity. This comes in many forms such as deferrals of advances and other payments to suppliers, deferrals of deliveries, reduced spending on services, and, in some cases, cancellation of orders. We face a challenging environment in the near to medium term as airlines adjust to reduced traffic which in turn will lower demand for commercial aerospace products and services. The current environment is also affecting the financial viability of some airlines.We currently expect it will take approximately three years for world-wide travel to return to 2019 levels and a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term trend growth of approximately 5%. To balance the supply and demand given the COVID-19 shock and to preserve our long-term potential and competitiveness, we have reduced the production rates of several of our BCA programs. These rate decisions are based on our ongoing assessments of the demand environment and availability of aircraft financing. There is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic levels will recover, and whether, and at what point, capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we made adjustments to our estimates regarding timing of 777X entry into service and market demand. We now anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. We will closely monitor the key factors that affect backlog and future demand including customers’ evolving fleet plans, the wide-body replacement cycle and the cargo market. We will maintain a disciplined rate management process, and make adjustments as appropriate in the future. Notwithstanding the changes we have made to production rates, risk remains that further reductions will be required. Additionally, if we are unable to make timely deliveries of the large number of aircraft in inventory as of December 31, 2020, future revenues, earnings and cash flows will be adversely impacted.The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth, increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. The shock from COVID-19 has reduced the near to medium term demand, but our Commercial Market Outlook forecast projects a 4% growth rate for passenger and cargo traffic over a 20 year period. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.5% average annual GDP growth, we project demand for approximately 43,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics and increased global environmental regulations.Deliveries of the 737 MAX resumed in the fourth quarter of 2020, when the FAA rescinded the order that grounded 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. Orders to suspend operations of 737 MAX aircraft from certain non-U.S. civil aviation authorities, including the Civil Aviation Administration of China, are still in effect. The grounding has had a significant adverse impact on our operations and creates significant uncertainty. We are focused on safely returning the 737 MAX to service for all of our customers.At BGS, we are seeing a direct impact on our commercial supply chain business as fewer flights and more aircraft retirements result in a decreased demand for our parts and logistics offerings. Additionally, our commercial customers are curtailing discretionary spending, such as modifications and upgrades and focusing on required maintenance. Similar to BCA, we expect a multi-year recovery period for the commercial services business. The demand outlook for our government services business, which in 2019 accounted for just under half of BGS revenue, remains stable.At BDS, we continue to see a healthy market with solid demand for our major platforms and programs both domestically and internationally. However, we experienced near-term production impacts associated with our temporary suspension of operations at various locations in 2020 .25Table of ContentsIn March and April of 2020, as a result of COVID-19, we temporarily suspended operations at multiple locations including the Puget Sound area, South Carolina and Philadelphia. Operations in Puget Sound and Philadelphia resumed during the week of April 20, while operations in South Carolina resumed beginning on May 3. We have implemented procedures to promote employee safety in our facilities, including more frequent and enhanced cleaning and adjusted schedules and work flows to support physical distancing. These actions have resulted, and will continue to result, in increased operating costs. In addition, a number of our suppliers have suspended or otherwise reduced their operations, and we are experiencing some supply chain shortages. Our suppliers are also experiencing liquidity pressures and disruptions to their operations as a result of COVID-19. We also continue to have large numbers of employees working from home. These measures and disruptions have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows in 2020. We expect further adverse impacts in future quarters.In July 2020, we announced our business transformation efforts to assess our business across five key pillars – infrastructure, overhead and organization, portfolio and investments, supply chain health and operational excellence. We continue to make progress across all five key pillars as we utilize a lower production rate environment to transform and improve our business processes. Within the infrastructure pillar we are assessing our overall facility requirements in light of reduced demand in our commercial businesses and remote and virtual work opportunities for large numbers of our workforce. The consolidation of the 787 production in South Carolina is an example of this. We also anticipate a reduction of approximately 30% in office space needs compared to our current capacity. During 2020, we made certain reductions to our footprint and are planning to implement further reductions over the next few years. However, as we consolidate our footprint, we may incur near term adverse impacts to earnings. The overhead and organization pillar is focused on our cost structure and how we are organized so we can right size our workforce and simplify and reduce management layers and bureaucracy. During 2020, we recorded severance costs for approximately 26,000 employees, of which approximately 18,000 have left the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the remainder are expected to leave in 2021. The portfolio and investments pillar includes aligning our portfolio and investments to focus on our core business and the changes in market conditions. Through our portfolio and investment prioritization, we reduced research and development and capital expenditures during 2020 by $1.3 billion from the prior year. The supply chain pillar is focused on supply chain health and stability, reducing indirect procurement spend and streamlining our transportation, logistics and warehousing approach. We reduced indirect spend in 2020, by reducing expenditures in areas such as freight and logistics, purchased services and others. The operational excellence pillar is focused on improving performance, enhancing quality and reducing rework. For example, our information technology teams are evaluating opportunities to form or expand strategic partnerships with vendors that allow us to simplify and optimize our operations, and reduce overall costs. These activities are not intended to constrain our capacity, but to enable the Company to emerge stronger and be more resilient when the market recovers. We expect that successful execution of these measures will improve near term liquidity and long term cost competitiveness.26Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations The following table summarizes key indicators of consolidated results of operations:(Dollars in millions, except per share data)Years ended December 31,202020192018Revenues$58,158 $76,559 $101,127 GAAP(Loss)/earnings from operations($12,767)($1,975)$11,987 Operating margins(22.0)%(2.6)%11.9 %Effective income tax rate17.5 %71.8 %9.9 %Net (loss)/earnings attributable to Boeing Shareholders($11,873)($636)$10,460 Diluted (loss)/earnings per share($20.88)($1.12)$17.85 Non-GAAP (1)Core operating (loss)/earnings($14,150)($3,390)$10,660 Core operating margins(24.3 %)(4.4 %)10.5 %Core (loss)/earnings per share($23.25)($3.47)$16.01 (1)These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense.

Revenues for each of our segments have been adversely impacted by COVID-19. BCA revenues decreased by $16,093 million due to lower deliveries driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, 787 production issues, and the 737 MAX grounding, offset by lower charges related to estimated potential concessions and other considerations to 737 MAX customers. BDS revenues increased by $162 million primarily due to higher fighter aircraft and other volume, partially offset by the impact of higher unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, largely due to the KC-46A Tanker charges in 2020. BGS revenues decreased by $2,925 million primarily due to lower commercial services revenue driven by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The changes in Unallocated items, eliminations and other primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries, as well as reserves related to cost accounting litigation recorded in 2019. We expect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to significantly impact revenues in future quarters until the commercial airline industry recovers.27Table of ContentsRevenues decreased by $24,568 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower revenues at BCA, partially offset by higher revenues at BGS. Lower BCA revenues are primarily driven by lower 737 MAX deliveries and a revenue reduction of $8,259 million recorded in 2019 for estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers for disruptions and associated delivery delays related to the 737 MAX grounding, net of insurance recoveries. The changes in Unallocated items, eliminations and other primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries and the sale of aircraft previously leased to customers.Loss/Earnings From Operations The following table summarizes (Loss)/earnings from operations:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202020192018Commercial Airplanes($13,847)($6,657)$7,830 Defense, Space & Security1,539 2,615 1,692 Global Services450 2,697 2,536 Boeing Capital63 28 79 Segment operating (loss)/profit(11,795)(1,317)12,137 Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment1,024 1,071 1,005 Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment359 344 322 Unallocated items, eliminations and other(2,355)(2,073)(1,477)(Loss)/earnings from operations (GAAP)($12,767)($1,975)$11,987 FAS/CAS service cost adjustment * (1,383)(1,415)(1,327)Core operating (loss)/earnings (Non-GAAP) **($14,150)($3,390)$10,660 * The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. ** Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. See pages 51 - 52.Loss from operations increased by $10,792 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to increased losses at BCA and decreased earnings at BGS and BDS. BCA loss from operations increased by $7,190 million. The loss in 2020 primarily reflects a reach-forward loss recorded in the fourth quarter of $6,493 million on the 777X program. The reach-forward loss reflects a number of factors, including an updated assessment of global certification requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and resulting in a management decision to make modifications to the aircraft’s design, an updated assessment of COVID-19 impacts on market demand, and discussions with our customers with respect to aircraft delivery timing. These factors resulted in adjustments to production rates and the program accounting quantity, increased change incorporation costs, and associated customer and supply chain impacts. The loss in 2020 also reflects the absence of MAX deliveries during the first three quarters of the year, lower wide-body deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and 787 production issues, abnormal production costs, 737NG frame fitting component repair costs, severance costs and 737 MAX customer considerations. The loss in 2019 primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters, and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations. BDS earnings decreased by $1,076 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to higher unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, including charges of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B in 2020, offset by $489 million of charges on Commercial Crew in 2019. The 28Table of Contentslower earnings were also driven by lower gains on property sales compared to 2019. BGS earnings from operations decreased by $2,247 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower commercial services revenue, as well as asset impairments and severance costs resulting from the COVID-19 market environment. We expect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to reduce earnings in future quarters until the commercial airline industry recovers.Loss from operations was $1,975 million in 2019 compared with earnings from operations of $11,987 million in 2018. The decrease of $13,962 million is primarily due to a loss from operations at BCA of $6,657 million in 2019 compared to earnings from operations of $7,830 million in 2018, partially offset by higher earnings at BDS and BGS in 2019 compared with 2018. BCA results decreased by $14,487 million due to lower 737 deliveries and the earnings charges for estimated 737 MAX grounding customer considerations of $8,259 million, net of insurance recoveries. BDS earnings from operations increased by $923 million primarily due to lower charges in 2019 for development programs. BGS earnings from operations increased by $161 million primarily due to higher revenues, which was partially offset by less favorable performance and mix.During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded reach-forward losses on the KC-46A Tanker program of $1,320 million, $148 million, and $736 million, respectively.Core operating loss increased by $10,760 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher losses at BCA and lower earnings at BGS and BDS.Core operating earnings decreased by $14,050 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to a loss from operations at BCA in 2019, partially offset by higher earnings at BDS and BGS.Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202020192018Share-based plans($120)($65)($76)Deferred compensation(93)(174)(19)Amortization of previously capitalized interest(95)(89)(92)Research and development expense, net(240)(401)(144)Customer financing impairment(250)Litigation (109)(148)Eliminations and other unallocated items(1,807)(985)(998)Unallocated items, eliminations and other($2,355)($2,073)($1,477)Share-based plans expense increased by $55 million in 2020, and decreased by $11 million in 2019. The increase in 2020 was due to increased grants of RSUs and other share-based compensation. See Note 17.Deferred compensation expense decreased by $81 million in 2020 and increased by $155 million in 2019, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price.29Table of ContentsResearch and development expense decreased by $161 million in 2020 and increased by $257 million in 2019 primarily due to spending by Boeing NeXt on product development.In 2019, we recorded a $250 million charge related to the impairment of lease incentives with one customer that experienced liquidity issues, and a $109 million charge related to ongoing litigation associated with recoverable costs on U.S. government contracts. In 2018, we recorded a $148 million charge related to the outcome of the Spirit litigation. Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $822 million in 2020 primarily due to earnings charges of $744 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to an agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice in January 2021. See Note 13. Eliminations and other unallocated expense decreased by $13 million in 2019 primarily due to timing of expense allocations. Net periodic pension benefit costs included in (Loss)/earnings from operations were as follows:(Dollars in millions)PensionYears ended December 31,202020192018Allocated to business segments($1,027)($1,384)($1,318)Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment1,024 1,071 1,005 Net periodic benefit cost included in (Loss)/earnings from operations($3)($313)($313)The pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in (Loss)/earnings from operations in 2020, 2019, and 2018 was largely consistent across all periods. The decrease in net periodic benefit cost included in (Loss)/earnings from operations in 2020 was primarily due to prior year service cost that was included in earnings in 2019. The net periodic benefit cost included in (Loss)/earnings from operations in 2019 was consistent with 2018, as reductions in current year service cost were offset by higher amortization of prior year service costs.For additional discussion related to Postretirement Plans, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Earnings Items(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202020192018(Loss)/earnings from operations($12,767)($1,975)$11,987 Other income, net447 438 92 Interest and debt expense(2,156)(722)(475)(Loss)/earnings before income taxes(14,476)(2,259)11,604 Income tax benefit/(expense)2,535 1,623 (1,144)Net loss from continuing operations(11,941)(636)10,460 Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest(68)Net (loss)/earnings attributable to Boeing Shareholders($11,873)($636)$10,460 Other income, net increased by $9 million in 2020 primarily due to lower non-operating postretirement expense, partially offset by lower non-operating pension income, lower interest income and higher foreign exchange losses.

The decreased income in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and lower asset returns, partially offset by lower interest cost. The increased income in 2019 compared to 2018 was due to lower amortization of actuarial losses, partially offset by lower asset returns and higher interest cost.Non-operating postretirement expense included in Other income, net was $16 million in 2020, $107 million in 2019, and $101 million in 2018. The decreased expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to lower interest cost. The expense in 2019 was largely consistent with 2018.Interest and debt expense increased by $1,434 million in 2020 and increased by $247 million in 2019 as a result of higher debt balances.For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. For long-term contracts, the amount reported as cost of sales is recognized as incurred. Substantially all contracts at our BDS segment and certain contracts at our BGS segment are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Cost of sales for commercial spare parts is recorded at average cost.The following table summarizes cost of sales:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 3120202019Change20192018ChangeCost of sales$63,843 $72,093 ($8,250)$72,093 $81,490 ($9,397)Cost of sales as a % of revenues109.8 %94.2 %15.6 %94.2 %80.6 %13.6 %Cost of sales decreased by $8,250 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower revenue in 2020, partially offset by higher charges in 2020 related to the 777X program, COVID-19 impacts, KC-46A Tanker program, abnormal production costs at BCA and severance costs. Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the reach-forward loss on the 777X program, impacts of the 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as severance costs.Cost of sales decreased by $9,397 million in 2019 compared with 2018, primarily due to lower revenue and lower reach-forward losses. Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues increased in 2019 primarily due to the 737 MAX grounding.31Table of ContentsResearch and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202020192018Commercial Airplanes$1,385 $1,956 $2,188 Defense, Space & Security713 741 776 Global Services138 121 161 Other240 401 144 Total$2,476 $3,219 $3,269 Research and development expense decreased by $743 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower spending at BCA and at Boeing NeXt on product development.Research and development expense decreased by $50 million in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower spending on 777X and 737 MAX, partially offset by higher spending on product development at BCA and Boeing NeXt.BacklogOur backlog at December 31 was as follows:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,20202019Commercial Airplanes$281,588 $376,593 Defense, Space & Security60,847 63,691 Global Services20,632 22,902 Unallocated items, eliminations and other337 217 Total Backlog$363,404 $463,403 Contractual backlog$339,309 $436,473 Unobligated backlog24,095 26,930 Total Backlog$363,404 $463,403 Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2020 was primarily due to a reduction for orders that in our assessment no longer meet the accounting requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 for inclusion in backlog primarily due to 737 MAX and 777X, deliveries in excess of new orders, aircraft order cancellations and changes in projected price escalation. We are experiencing fewer new 737 MAX orders than we were receiving prior to the grounding. If 737 MAX aircraft remain grounded in certain jurisdictions for an extended period of time and/or if entry into service of the 777X, 737 MAX 7 and/or 737 MAX 10 is further delayed, we may experience additional reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations. Additionally, we may continue to experience fewer new orders and increased cancellations across all of our commercial airplane programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand.Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2020 was primarily due to reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BGS and BDS contracts, partially offset by contract awards.32Table of ContentsAdditional ConsiderationsGlobal Trade We continually monitor the global trade environment in response to geopolitical economic developments, as well as changes in tariffs, trade agreements, or sanctions that may impact the company.The global economy is currently experiencing significant adverse impacts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a decline in overall trade in general and in aerospace in particular. There is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the duration, scale, and localization of these impacts to the global economy and governments are enacting a wide range of responses to mitigate the unfolding economic impacts. We are closely monitoring the current impact and potential future economic consequences of COVID-19 to the global economy, the aerospace sector, and our Company. These adverse economic impacts have resulted in fewer orders than previously anticipated for our commercial aircraft.China is a very significant market for commercial airplanes and represents a significant component of our commercial airplanes backlog. Since 2018, the U.S. and China imposed an escalating series of tariffs on each other’s imports. Certain aircraft parts and components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. The U.S. and China entered into a Phase I agreement in January 2020. However, implementation of this agreement is incomplete and overall diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated. We continue monitoring developments for potential adverse impacts to the Company.Beginning in June 2018, the U.S. Government has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several major U.S. trading partners have imposed, or announced their intention to impose, tariffs on U.S. goods. In May 2019, the U.S. Government, Mexico and Canada reached an agreement to end the steel and aluminum tariffs between these countries. Implementation of the U.S./Mexico/Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA) will also result in lower tariffs. We continue to monitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from the remaining global tariffs. The U.S. Government continues to impose and/or consider imposing sanctions on certain businesses and individuals in Russia. Although our operations or sales in Russia have not been impacted to date, we continue to monitor additional sanctions that may be imposed by the U.S. Government and any responses from Russia that could affect our supply chain, business partners or customers.The U.S. and European Union (EU) have been engaged in two long-running disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) relating to large civil aircraft. As part of those disputes, in October 2019, the WTO authorized the U.S. to impose approximately $7.50 billion in annual tariffs on EU products in connection with the EU’s provision of eight instances of launch aid subsidies to Airbus. The U.S. is currently imposing 15% tariffs on new Airbus airplanes imported into the U.S. as well as fuselages that Airbus manufactures in Europe and imports into the U.S. In October 2020, the WTO authorized the EU to impose approximately $3.99 billion in annual tariffs on U.S. products in connection with a tax incentive used by Boeing in Washington state that has since been repealed. The EU is currently imposing 15% tariffs on Boeing airplanes imported into the EU. We will continue to assess and work with our customers on the possible impact of these tariffs, as deliveries to European customers are expected to increase in 2021.33Table of ContentsSegment Results of Operations and Financial ConditionCommercial AirplanesBusiness Environment and TrendsAirline Industry Environment See Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment. Industry Competitiveness The industry continues to adjust to the unprecedented COVID-19 shock and subsequent economic impact, government restrictions, and new regulations. The commercial airplane market and the airline industry both remain extremely competitive. While the impacts and responses have varied globally, the reduction of demand and disruption in production has adversely impacted most manufacturers in the commercial airplane industry.Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 80% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. The grounding of the 737 MAX and the associated suspension of 737 MAX deliveries significantly reduced our market share with respect to deliveries of single aisle aircraft in 2019 and 2020 and may provide competitors with an opportunity to obtain more orders and increase market share. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. After the acquisition of a majority share of Bombardier’s C Series (now A220) in 2018, Airbus continues to expand in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market. Other competitors are also in different phases of developing commercial jet aircraft. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without broad commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Competitors continue to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.We are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our business transformation efforts, which enhances our ability to compete and positions us for market recovery. We are also focused on taking actions to ensure that Boeing is not harmed by unfair subsidization of competitors.34Table of ContentsResults of Operations (Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202020192018Revenues$16,162 $32,255 $57,499 % of total company revenues28 %42 %57 %(Loss)/earnings from operations($13,847)($6,657)$7,830 Operating margins(85.7)%(20.6)%13.6 %Research and development$1,385 $1,956 $2,188 Revenues BCA revenues decreased by $16,093 million in 2020 compared with 2019 due to lower deliveries primarily driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, 787 production issues and the 737 MAX grounding. This was partially offset by lower charges related to estimated potential concessions and other considerations to 737 MAX customers of $498 million in 2020 compared with $8,259 million in 2019. BCA revenues decreased by $25,244 million in 2019 compared with 2018 driven by lower 737 MAX deliveries and a revenue reduction of $8,259 million that was recorded in 2019 for estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers related to the 737 MAX grounding, net of $500 million of insurance recoveries. While we resumed deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft in December 2020, the 737 MAX grounding is still in effect in certain non-U.S. jurisdictions. The 737 MAX grounding will continue to have a significant impact on future revenues until deliveries ramp up, and COVID-19 will continue to have a significant impact on future revenues until the commercial airline industry recovers.Commercial Airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows:737 *747 767 *777 †787 Total2020Cumulative deliveries7,4821,5601,2061,653992Deliveries43(14)530(11)26531572019Cumulative deliveries7,4391,5551,1761,627939Deliveries127(19)743(23)45(2)1583802018Cumulative deliveries7,3121,5481,1331,582781Deliveries580(18)627(10)48145806* Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses† Aircraft accounted for as revenues by BCA and as operating leases in consolidation identified by parenthesesLoss/Earnings From Operations BCA loss from operations was $13,847 million in 2020 compared with loss from operations of $6,657 million in 2019. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million, lower deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and 787 production issues and associated rework, $2,567 million of abnormal production costs related to 737 MAX, $623 million of 35Table of Contentsseverance cost, $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations, $336 million related to 737NG frame fitting component repair costs and $270 million of abnormal production costs in the first half of 2020 from the temporary suspension of operations in response to COVID-19, partially offset by lower research and development spending. Lower 787 margins reflecting a reduction in the accounting quantity in the first quarter of 2020 also contributed to lower earnings. The 2019 loss primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations. BCA loss from operations was $6,657 million in 2019 compared with earnings from operations of $7,830 million in 2018. The decrease of $14,487 million is primarily due to lower 737 deliveries and earnings charges related to the 737 MAX. The 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins until 737 MAX deliveries ramp up and wide-body deliveries return to historical levels.Backlog Our total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of Topic 606.BCA total backlog of $281,588 million at December 31, 2020 decreased from $376,593 million at December 31, 2019, reflecting a reduction for orders that in our assessment no longer meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog, aircraft order cancellations, changes in projected price escalation and deliveries in excess of new orders. Aircraft order cancellations during the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $34,618 million and primarily relate to 737 MAX aircraft. The ASC 606 adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2020 totaled $54,450 million and primarily relate to 737 MAX aircraft and 777X aircraft. The ASC 606 adjustments include aircraft orders where a customer controlled contingency now exists, as well as orders where we can no longer assert that the customer is committed to perform or that it is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. If 737 MAX aircraft remain grounded in certain jurisdictions for an extended period of time and/or if entry into service of the 777X, 737 MAX 7 and/or 737 MAX 10 is further delayed, we may experience additional reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations. Additionally, we may continue to experience fewer new orders and increased cancellations across all of our commercial airplane programs as a result the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand.Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, 36Table of Contentsletters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.The following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. Firm orders include military derivative aircraft that are not included in program accounting quantities. All revenues and costs associated with military derivative aircraft production are reported in the BDS segment.Program737 †747*767 777 †777X787 †2020Program accounting quantities10,0001,5741,2071,700350 1,500Undelivered units under firm orders3,28287541191458(22)Cumulative firm orders10,7641,5681,2811,6941911,4502019Program accounting quantities10,4001,5741,1951,690**1,600Undelivered units under firm orders4,398179468309520(29)Cumulative firm orders11,8371,5721,2701,6953091,4592018Program accounting quantities10,4001,5741,1951,680**1,600Undelivered units under firm orders4,708(75)24111100(2)326604(30)Cumulative firm orders12,0201,5721,2441,6823261,385† Aircraft ordered by BCC are identified in parentheses.* At December 31, 2020, the 747 accounting quantity includes one already completed aircraft that has not been sold and is being remarketed.** See 777 and 777X Programs for discussion of the 777X accounting quantity.Program Highlights737 Program We reduced the program accounting quantity from 10,400 at December 31, 2019 to 10,000 at March 31, 2020. This reflects a slower than previously planned production rate ramp-up caused by commercial airline industry uncertainty due to the impact of COVID-19. See further discussion of the 737 MAX Grounding and COVID-19 Impacts and Product Warranties in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.747 Program We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month. We will complete production of the 747 in 2022. We believe that ending production of the 747 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during 2020 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the tanker program. We are currently producing at a rate of 3 aircraft per month.37Table of Contents777 and 777X Programs The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 10 units during 2020 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The production rate expectation for the combined 777/777X program remains at 2 per month in 2021.In 2013, we launched the 777X-8 and 777X-9, which feature new composite wings, new engines and folding wing-tips. The first flight of the 777X was completed during the first quarter of 2020.During the first three quarters of 2020, we made adjustments to our estimates regarding timing of 777X entry into service and market demand. As previously disclosed, market uncertainties driven primarily by the impacts of COVID-19 resulted in lower planned production rates and created significant pressure on the 777X program’s revenue and cost estimates. While the 777X program did not have a reach-forward loss as of the third quarter of 2020 based on our assessment of the probable range of initial accounting quantities and other factors at that time, we noted that future levels of 777X profitability would be subject to a number of factors, including continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as on our supply chain and customers, subsequent production rate reductions for both 777X and other commercial programs, and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of 777X certification.We now anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. We also recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program in the fourth quarter of 2020. The revised schedule and the reach-forward loss reflect a number of factors, including an updated assessment of global certification requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and resulting in a management decision to make modifications to the aircraft’s design, an updated assessment of COVID-19 impacts on market demand, and discussions with our customers with respect to aircraft delivery timing. These factors resulted in adjustments to production rates and the program accounting quantity, increased change incorporation costs, and associated customer and supply chain impacts. The timing of the certification will ultimately be determined by the regulators, and further determinations with respect to anticipated certification requirements could result in additional delays in entry into service and/or additional cost increases.The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods.787 Program During 2020, we experienced significant reductions in deliveries due to the impacts of COVID-19 on our customers as well as production issues and associated rework. The 787 program delivered four airplanes during the fourth quarter of 2020 and has a large number of undelivered airplanes in inventory at December 31, 2020. We expanded the scope of production inspections during the fourth quarter of 2020, and those inspections and associated rework are delaying scheduled deliveries and resulting in additional 787 aircraft in inventory. At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 80 787 aircraft in inventory. We expect deliveries to resume at a slow pace in early 2021, with the majority of the aircraft in inventory expected to be delivered by the end of 2021. We continue to work with customers to facilitate deliveries. We are implementing changes in the production process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections. Pre-COVID-19, we were producing at a rate of 14 per month and had planned to adjust the 787 production rate to 12 per month in late 2020 and to 10 per month in early 2021. Due to the impacts of COVID-19 on customer demand, we now plan to reduce to 5 per month in 2021. As a result of the planned production rate changes, we reduced the accounting quantity for the 787 program by 100 units during the first quarter of 2020. The 787 program has near breakeven gross margins due to the 38Table of Contentsreductions in the production rates and the reduction in the program accounting quantity. If we are required to further reduce the accounting quantity and/or production rates, experience further delivery delays, or experience other factors that could result in lower margins, the program could record a reach-forward loss in future periods. We made the decision during the third quarter of 2020 to consolidate 787 production in South Carolina in 2021, which did not have a significant financial impact on the program.Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.Go-ahead and Initial Delivery737 MAX 720112021737 MAX 1020172023777X20132023Reflects models in development during 2020We launched the 737 MAX 7 in August 2011 and the 737 MAX 10 in June 2017. We launched the 777X in November 2013. We now anticipate that the first 737 MAX 10 and 777X delivery will occur in 2023. This schedule reflects a number of factors, including an updated assessment of global certification requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and resulting in a management decision to make modifications to the aircraft’s design.Additional ConsiderationsThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X and 737 MAX derivatives, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. These challenges include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, the addition of regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become 39Table of Contentsnecessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.Defense, Space & Security Business Environment and Trends United States Government Defense Environment OverviewThe Omnibus appropriations acts for FY21, enacted in December 2020, provided FY21 appropriations for government departments and agencies, including the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration.The enacted FY21 appropriations included funding for Boeing’s major programs, such as the F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15EX, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Tanker, P-8 Poseidon and Space Launch System. However, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to future program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including NASA. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows.Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2020, 31.8% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers. Results of Operations (Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202020192018Revenues$26,257 $26,095 $26,300 % of total company revenues45 %34 %26 %Earnings from operations$1,539 $2,615 $1,692 Operating margins5.9 %10.0 %6.4 %Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular period, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.40Table of ContentsDeliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, including remanufactures and modifications were as follows:Years ended December 31,202020192018F/A-18 Models20 23 17 F-15 Models4 11 10 C-17 Globemaster III1 CH-47 Chinook (New)27 13 13 CH-47 Chinook (Renewed)3 22 17 AH-64 Apache (New)19 37 AH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)52 74 23 KC-46A Tanker14 28 P-8 Models15 18 16 C-40A2 Total154 229 96 New-build satellite deliveries were as follows:Years ended December 31,202020192018Commercial and civil satellites21Military satellites1Revenues BDS revenues in 2020 increased by $162 million compared with 2019 reflecting higher revenues from fighter aircraft, Space Launch System, B-52 upgrades, proprietary and MQ-25, partially offset by reduced volume in missile defense. These net increases were offset by the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which was $312 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year, largely due to the KC-46A Tanker charges during 2020.BDS revenues in 2019 decreased by $205 million compared with 2018 primarily due to timing associated with non-U.S. contract awards for fighters and the final C-17 sale occurring in 2018; in addition, the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was $163 million higher than the prior year, reflecting increased unfavorable adjustments on the Commercial Crew contract and less favorable performance. These were partially offset by increases from new programs, including E-7 early warning aircraft, VC-25B, T-7A Red Hawk, and MQ-25, as well as from satellites and weapons.Earnings From Operations BDS earnings from operations in 2020 decreased by $1,076 million compared with 2019 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which was $828 million higher than the prior year, largely due to charges of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B, offset by $489 million in charges on Commercial Crew in the prior period. The lower earnings in 2020 also reflect lower gains on property sales compared to the same period in 2019. These current period decreases were partially offset by the volume increases described above.The KC-46A Tanker reach-forward loss of $1,320 million reflects $551 million of costs associated with the agreement signed in April 2020 with the U.S. Air Force to develop and integrate a new Remote Vision System, and the remaining costs reflect production inefficiencies including impacts of COVID-19 disruption. The $168 million reach-forward loss on VC-25B recorded in the first quarter was associated 41Table of Contentswith engineering inefficiencies from the COVID-19 environment. We believe these inefficiencies will result in staffing challenges, schedule inefficiencies, and higher costs in the upcoming phases of the program.BDS earnings from operations in 2019 increased by $923 million compared with 2018 primarily due to the absence of $691 million related to losses on the T-7A Red Hawk and MQ-25 contracts. The unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019 was $62 million lower than the prior year. In 2019, BDS recorded charges of $489 million related to Commercial Crew and $148 million related to KC-46A Tanker compared with $736 million in 2018.BDS earnings from operations include equity earnings of $141 million, $128 million and $147 million primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.BacklogTotal backlog of $60,847 million at December 31, 2020 was $2,844 million lower than December 31, 2019 due to the timing of awards and revenue recognized.Additional ConsiderationsOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis, and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed-price proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues.Global Services Business Environment and TrendsThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics, and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering, and upgrades; training and professional services; and information services. Prior to COVID-19, we had expected the market to grow by around 3.5% annually, however the pandemic is having a direct impact on our commercial services business. See Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment. Over the long-term, as the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of 42Table of Contentsairplanes. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.The demand outlook for our government services business has remained stable in 2020. Government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability. BGS’ major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 40, which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions. Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202020192018Revenues$15,543 $18,468 $17,056 % of total company revenues27 %24 %17 %Earnings from operations$450 $2,697 $2,536 Operating margins2.9 %14.6 %14.9 %Revenues BGS revenues in 2020 decreased by $2,925 million compared with 2019 due to lower commercial services revenue driven by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2020 was $101 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year. We expect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to reduce BGS commercial revenues in future quarters until the commercial airline industry environment recovers.BGS revenues in 2019 increased by $1,412 million compared with 2018 due to growth across our services portfolio, primarily driven by higher parts revenue, including the acquisition of KLX in the fourth quarter of 2018 and government services revenue, partially offset by lower commercial services revenue. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019 was $80 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year.43Table of ContentsEarnings From Operations BGS earnings from operations in 2020 decreased by $2,247 million compared with 2019, primarily due to lower commercial services revenue as well as earnings charges in 2020, including $531 million of inventory write-downs, $178 million of related impairments of distribution rights primarily driven by airlines' decisions to retire certain aircraft, $398 million for higher expected credit losses primarily driven by customer liquidity issues, $115 million of contract termination and facility impairment charges, as well as $72 million of severance costs. These charges reflect the significant impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial airline customers’ liquidity and demand for certain products as customers' fleet plans evolve to adapt to the sharp reduction in demand for air travel. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2020 was consistent with the prior year.BGS earnings from operations in 2019 increased by $161 million compared with 2018 primarily due to higher revenues, partially offset by less favorable performance and mix. Earnings from operations for 2019 also includes a divestiture gain of $395 million and a charge of $293 million related to our decision in the fourth quarter to retire the Aviall brand and trade name. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2019 was $21 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year.BacklogBGS total backlog of $20,632 million at December 31, 2020 decreased by 10% from $22,902 million at December 31, 2019, primarily due to a reduction for commercial orders that, in our assessment, no longer meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog.Boeing CapitalBusiness Environment and TrendsBCC’s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2020 totaled $1,974 million. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is related to customers that we believe have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.BCC provided customer financing of $14 million and $419 million during 2020 and 2019. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2021 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 7,300 western-built commercial jet aircraft (29.4% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2020, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, a larger portion are expected to be retired compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, which directly impacts the Company in terms of number of new aircraft deliveries and financing opportunities, the ability of existing customers to meet current payment obligations and the value of aircraft in its portfolio. We continue to work closely with our customers to mitigate the risk. At the end of 2019 and 2018, 8.5% and 6.7% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. See Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.44Table of ContentsResults of Operations (Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202020192018Revenues$261 $244 $274 Earnings from operations$63 $28 $79 Operating margins24 %11 %29 %Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income.

BCC enters into certain transactions with Boeing, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.Leased aircraft with a carrying value of approximately $57 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2021. We are seeking to remarket these aircraft or have the leases extended.45Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow Summary(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202020192018Net (loss)/earnings($11,941)($636)$10,460 Non-cash items10,866 2,819 2,578 Changes in working capital(17,335)(4,629)2,284 Net cash (used)/provided by operating activities(18,410)(2,446)15,322 Net cash used by investing activities(18,366)(1,530)(4,621)Net cash provided/(used) by financing activities34,955 5,739 (11,722)Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents85 (5)(53)Net (decrease)/increase in cash & cash equivalents, including restricted(1,736)1,758 (1,074)Cash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at beginning of year9,571 7,813 8,887 Cash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at end of year$7,835 $9,571 $7,813 Operating Activities Net cash used by operating activities was $18.4 billion during 2020, compared with net cash used by operating activities of $2.4 billion during 2019 and net cash provided by operating activities of $15.3 billion in 2018. The decrease in operating cash flows in 2020 is primarily driven by our net loss in 2020 and changes in working capital, partially offset by an increase in non-cash items. Non-cash items include the $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program in 2020, which was recorded as a reduction to inventory. The year-over-year increase in non-cash items also reflects higher inventory write-downs and higher allowances for expected credit losses in 2020. The changes in working capital reflect increases in commercial airplane inventory due to the large number of undelivered aircraft in 2019 resulting from the 737 MAX grounding, and in 2020 due to the 737 MAX grounding, 787 production issues and COVID-19 impacts. Cash used by Advances and progress billings was $1.1 billion in 2020, as compared with $0.7 billion provided by Advances and progress billings in 2019. The changes in working capital in 2020 also reflect lower accounts payable due to reductions in commercial purchases from suppliers and lower supply chain financing. Compensation payments to 737 MAX customers totaled $2.2 billion during 2020 and $1.2 billion during 2019. The accrued liability for 737 MAX customer considerations at December 31, 2019 resulted in a $7.4 billion favorable change to working capital in 2019. The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAX grounding are expected to continue to have a significant negative impact on our operating cash flows during 2021.The decrease in operating cash flows in 2019 compared to 2018 primarily reflected the impacts of the 737 MAX grounding resulting in lower earnings, higher inventory and lower advances and progress payments. In addition, compensation payments to 737 MAX customers of $1.2 billion for disruption to their operations also reduced 2019 cash from operating activities. Cash used to fund inventory was $12.4 billion during 2019 as we continued to produce aircraft while deliveries were suspended. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $0.7 billion in 2019, compared with $2.6 billion in 2018. Payables to suppliers who elected to participate in supply chain financing programs declined by $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020, and increased by $2.6 billion and $0.6 billion for the same period in 2019 and 2018. Supply chain financing is not material to our overall liquidity. The decline for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to reductions in commercial purchases from suppliers. The increase for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 reflects a combination of higher purchases, an extension of payment terms with certain suppliers, and increased utilization of our supply chain financing programs.46Table of ContentsInvesting Activities Cash used by investing activities during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $18.4 billion, $1.5 billion and $4.6 billion. The increase in cash outflows in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to $17.4 billion of higher net contributions to investments. The reduction in cash outflows in 2019 compared with 2018 is primarily due to acquisitions completed in the second half of 2018 and the timing of investments. Acquisitions net of cash acquired were $0.5 billion in 2019, primarily related to the acquisition of KLX. Proceeds from dispositions was $0.5 billion in 2019 as a result of the divestiture of two businesses. Capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion in 2020, compared with $1.8 billion in 2019 and $1.7 billion 2018. We expect capital expenditures in 2021 to be relatively consistent with 2020. Net contributions to investments were $17.3 billion in 2020, compared with net proceeds from investments of $0.1 billion in 2019 and $0.3 billion in 2018.Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $35.0 billion during 2020, compared with cash provided by financing activities of $5.7 billion in 2019 and cash used by financing activities of $11.7 billion in 2018. The increase of $29.3 billion compared with 2019 primarily reflects higher net borrowings, lower share repurchases, and lower dividend payments. Cash provided by financing activities increased $17.5 billion compared with 2018 primarily due to higher net borrowings and lower share repurchases, partially offset by higher dividend payments in 2019. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, new borrowings net of repayments were $36.3 billion compared with $13.2 billion and $1.4 billion in the same period in 2019 and 2018. The increase in 2020 is primarily due to $29.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes issued in 2020 and $13.8 billion of new borrowings under a two-year delayed draw term loan agreement entered into in the first quarter of 2020. For further discussion see Liquidity Matters in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.At December 31, 2020 and 2019 the recorded balance of debt was $63.6 billion and $27.3 billion, of which $1.7 billion and $7.3 billion were classified as short-term. This included $1.6 billion and $2.0 billion of debt attributable to BCC at December 31, 2020 and 2019, of which $0.9 billion and $0.5 billion were classified as short-term.During the year ended December 31, 2020, we did not repurchase any shares through our open market share repurchase program compared to repurchases of 6.9 million and 26.1 million shares in 2019 and 2018 totaling $2.7 billion and $9.0 billion. Share repurchases under this plan had been suspended since April 2019. In March 2020, the Board of Directors terminated its prior authorization to repurchase shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. We had 0.6 million, 0.6 million, and 0.7 million shares transferred to us from employee tax withholdings in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 we paid dividends of $1.2 billion compared with $4.6 billion and $3.9 billion in the same period in 2019 and 2018. In March 2020, the Company announced that our dividend will be suspended until further notice. In December 2018 we increased our quarterly dividend from $1.71 to $2.055, which resulted in $684 million of higher dividend payments in 2019 compared with 2018.Capital Resources The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and 737 MAX grounding are having a significant negative impact on our liquidity and ongoing operations and creating significant uncertainty. We have and are continuing to take significant actions to manage and preserve our liquidity. For further discussion see Liquidity Matters in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.At December 31, 2020, we had $7.8 billion of cash and $17.8 billion of short term investments. At December 31, 2020, we had $9.5 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. The $9.5 billion of unused borrowing capacity includes a $3.1 billion 364-day revolving credit facility, which expires in October 2021. We had no commercial paper borrowings at December 31, 2020, compared to commercial paper borrowings of $6.1 billion and $1.9 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018, which were supported by unused commitments under the revolving credit agreement.47Table of ContentsOur debt balances have increased significantly since 2019, and we are continuing to actively manage our liquidity. Scheduled principal payments for debt for the next five years are as follows:20212022202320242025Debt$1,630 $14,976 $3,776 $2,001 $4,301 Our increased debt balance has also resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings. We expect to be able to access capital markets when we require additional funding in order to pay off existing debt, address further impacts to our business related to market developments, fund outstanding financing commitments, or meet other business requirements. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, including impacts described above related to the COVID-19 pandemic and/or associated changes in demand for our products and services. These risks will be particularly acute if we are subject to further credit rating downgrades. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and financing or contractual commitments. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. At December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.Customer financing commitments totaled $11.5 billion and $13.4 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The decrease primarily relates to financing commitment amendments and expirations. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our pension plans were $13.7 billion and $15.9 billion underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2020. We do not expect to make significant contributions to our pension plans in 2021. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.In the fourth quarter of 2020, we contributed $3 billion of our common stock to our pension fund. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we also began using our common stock in lieu of cash to fund Company contributions to our 401(k) plans for the foreseeable future, which we estimate will conserve approximately $1 billion of cash over the next 12 months. Under this approach, common stock is contributed to our 401(k) plans following each pay period. We expect this measure to further enable the Company to conserve cash. We have retained an independent fiduciary to manage and liquidate stock contributed to these plans at its discretion.48Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2020, and the estimated timing thereof.(Dollars in millions)TotalLessthan 1year1-3years3-5yearsAfter 5yearsLong-term debt (including current portion)$63,963 $1,630 $18,752 $6,302 $37,279 Interest on debt37,614 2,271 4,274 3,852 27,217 Pension and other postretirement cash requirements5,077 610 1,163 1,073 2,231 Finance lease obligations228 68 84 20 56 Operating lease obligations1,781 307 432 240 802 Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position93,928 36,540 29,933 16,367 11,088 Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position19,621 19,502 99 7 13 Total contractual obligations (1)$222,212 $60,928 $54,737 $27,861 $78,686 (1) Excludes income tax matters. As of December 31, 2020, we have uncertain tax positions of $966 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of income taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, customer financing equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.49Table of ContentsPurchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2020, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2020, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $26.4 billion that extend through 2034. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.Commercial CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2020.(Dollars in millions)Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of LossLess than1 year1-3years4-5yearsAfter 5yearsStandby letters of credit and surety bonds$4,238 $1,680 $1,621 $735 $202 Commercial aircraft financing commitments11,512 2,329 4,061 3,504 1,618 Total commercial commitments$15,750 $4,009 $5,682 $4,239 $1,820 Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Contingent ObligationsWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $565 million at December 31, 2020. For additional information, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.50Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsWe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-GAAP MeasuresCore Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per ShareOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in (loss)/earnings from operations during 2020 was a benefit of $1,024 million, largely consistent with a benefit of $1,071 million in 2019 and $1,005 million in 2018. The non-operating pension expense included in Other income, net was a benefit of $340 million in 2020, $374 million in 2019 and $143 million in 2018. The benefits in 2020, 2019, and 2018 reflect expected returns in excess of interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on pages 30 - 31 of this Form 10-K and see Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost, primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.51Table of ContentsReconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP MeasuresThe table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share.

Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.Accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, COVID-19 disruptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all long-term contracts decreased Earnings from operations by $942 million, $111 million and $190 million, respectively. The cumulative catch-up adjustments in 2020 were primarily due to reach-forward losses incurred on the KC-46A Tanker program.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all long-term contract performance obligations for all of 2020 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $330 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.Program AccountingProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and 53Table of Contentsanticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, COVID-19 disruptions, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. This includes reassessing the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, typically have lower initial margins than established programs and a higher risk for reach-forward loss. Actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. Deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized.We now anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. We also recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program in the fourth quarter of 2020. The revised schedule and the reach-forward loss reflect a number of factors, including an updated assessment of global certification requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and resulting in a management decision to make modifications to the aircraft’s design, an updated assessment of COVID-19 impacts on market demand, and discussions with our customers with respect to aircraft delivery timing. These factors resulted in adjustments to production rates and the program accounting quantity, increased change incorporation costs, and associated customer and supply chain impacts. Absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs, deliveries which are expected to begin in 2023 will be recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors 54Table of Contentscould result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods which may be material.Due to the impacts of COVID-19 on our customers as well as production issues and associated rework, the 787 program has near breakeven gross margins at December 31, 2020. The margins reflect reductions in the production rate and program accounting quantity during 2020. If we are required to further reduce the accounting quantity and/or production rates or experience higher than anticipated costs or delays addressing production issues and associated rework, or other factors that could result in lower margins, the program could record a reach-forward loss in future periods which may be material.The 747 and 767 programs also have near breakeven gross margins at December 31, 2020. If we are unable to mitigate risks associated with these programs, or if our assumptions with respect to items such as pricing, cost, accounting quantity or future production rates were to change, we could be required to record reach-forward losses in future periods which may be material.737 MAX GroundingIn 2019, following two fatal 737 MAX accidents, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and non-U.S. civil aviation authorities issued orders suspending commercial operations of 737 MAX aircraft. Deliveries of the 737 MAX were suspended following these orders. Deliveries resumed in late 2020 following rescission by the FAA of its grounding order. Multiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the accidents. In addition, we are fully cooperating with U.S. government investigations related to the accidents and the 737 MAX program, including an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the outcome of which may be material. On January 6, 2021, we entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice that resolves the Department of Justice’s previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the FAA. Other than with respect to the U.S. Department of Justice, we cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, not covered by available insurance that may result given the current status of the lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.In the preparation of our financial statements, we have made assumptions regarding outcomes of accident investigations and other government inquiries, timing and conditions of return to service, the timing of future 737 production rate increases, supplier readiness to support production rate changes, timing and sequence of future customer deliveries as well as outcomes of negotiations with customers impacted by the grounding. We have also made significant assumptions regarding estimated costs expected to be incurred in 2021 that should be included in program inventory and those costs that should be expensed when incurred as abnormal production costs. While these assumptions reflect our best estimate at this time, they are highly uncertain and significantly affect the estimates inherent in our financial statements.In December 2020, we delivered 27 aircraft, in compliance with the FAA regulatory requirements. We have assumed that the remaining non-U.S. regulatory approvals will occur and enable deliveries during the first half of 2021. We have approximately 425 airplanes in inventory as of December 31, 2020. A number of customers have requested to defer deliveries or to cancel orders for 737 MAX aircraft, and we are remarketing and/or delaying deliveries of certain aircraft included within inventory. We now expect to deliver about half of the 737 MAX aircraft in inventory by the end of 2021. In the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveries in non-U.S. jurisdictions consistent with our assumptions of regulatory approval timing, our expectation of delivery timing could be impacted.Due to the grounding and associated suspension of 737 MAX deliveries, we temporarily suspended 737 MAX production beginning in January 2020. We resumed early stages of 737 MAX production in May 2020 and continued to produce at low rates through the end of 2020. 55Table of ContentsIn addition, we reduced the number of aircraft included in the accounting quantity by 400 units in the first quarter of 2020 as a result of reductions to planned production rates due to COVID-19 driven market uncertainties. As we are producing at abnormally low production rates in 2020 and 2021, we expect to incur approximately $5.0 billion of abnormal production costs that are being expensed as incurred. The slowdown in the planned production rate ramp-up increased expected abnormal costs however this increase was offset by adjustments to the determination of the normal production level due to COVID-19 impacts on customer demand, as well as cost reduction activities, including significant reductions in employment levels. We expensed approximately $2.6 billion of abnormal production costs during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition to impacts related to the 737 MAX accidents and subsequent grounding, the 737 program continues to be significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and its effect on aircraft demand. These impacts have resulted in lower production and delivery rate assumptions. We currently expect to gradually increase the production rate to 31 per month by early 2022. We currently assume that we will implement further gradual production rate increases in subsequent periods based on market demand. The ongoing impacts of COVID-19 on market demand have also created significant uncertainty around the timing of deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft in inventory. We may need to recognize additional costs associated with remarketing and/or reconfiguring aircraft in inventory, which may reduce revenue and/or earnings in future periods. We are working with our customers to minimize the impact to their operations from grounded and undelivered aircraft. We continue to reassess the liability for estimated potential concessions and other considerations to customers on a quarterly basis. This reassessment includes updating estimates to reflect revisions to return to service, delivery and production rate assumptions driven by timing of regulatory approvals, as well as latest information based on engagements with 737 MAX customers. The remaining liability of $5.5 billion at December 31, 2020 represents our current best estimate of future concessions and other considerations to customers, and is necessarily based on a series of assumptions. It is subject to change in future quarters as negotiations with customers mature and timing and conditions of return to service are better understood. Our assumptions reflect our current best estimate, but actual timing and conditions of return to service and resumption of deliveries could differ from this estimate, the effect of which could be material. We are unable at this time to reasonably estimate potential future additional financial impacts or a range of loss, if any, due to continued uncertainties related to the timing and conditions of return to service, uncertainties related to the impacts of COVID-19 on our operations, supply chain and customers, future changes to the production rate, supply chain impacts, and/or the results of negotiations with particular customers. Any such impacts, including any changes in our estimates, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and/or cash flows. For example, we expect that, in the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveries in non-U.S. jurisdictions consistent with our assumptions, the continued absence of revenue, earnings, and cash flows associated with 737 MAX deliveries would continue to have a material impact on our operating results. In the event that future production rate increases occur at a slower rate or take longer than we are currently assuming we expect that the growth in inventory and other cash flow impacts associated with production would decrease. However, while any prolonged production suspension or delays in planned production rate increases could mitigate the impact on our liquidity, it could significantly increase the overall expected costs to produce aircraft included in the accounting quantity, which would reduce 737 program margins and/or increase abnormal production costs in the future.Goodwill ImpairmentsWe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or quantitative test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. If we determine it is more likely than 56Table of Contentsnot that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, then a quantitative test is performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For operations where the quantitative test is used, we compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment.We generally estimate the fair values of the related operations using a combination of discounted cash flows and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs, and changes in working capital. These forecasts reflect existing firm orders, expected future orders, expected production rates and delivery profiles, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2020 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. As a result of the continuing significant adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our Commercial Airplanes and Commercial Services businesses, we concluded it is a triggering event for testing whether goodwill recorded by our Commercial Airplanes and Commercial Services reporting units is impaired. At December 31, 2020, Commercial Airplanes has $1,316 million of goodwill and Commercial Services has $3,087 million. We performed a quantitative test and determined the fair values of our Commercial Airplane and Commercial Services reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, we also estimated the fair values of our other reporting units significantly exceeded their corresponding carrying values.We will continue to monitor the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in future quarters. Changes in our forecasts, discount rates, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods.Pension PlansMany of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union employees transitioned to company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.57Table of ContentsThe projected benefit obligation is sensitive to discount rates. The projected benefit obligation would decrease by $2,591 million or increase by $2,930 million if the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on pension cost. However, net periodic pension cost is sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2020 net periodic pension cost by $145 million.Deferred Income Taxes – Valuation AllowanceThe Company has deferred income tax assets of $11,600 million at December 31, 2020, that can be used in future years to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable. The Company has deferred income tax liabilities of $9,430 million at December 31, 2020, that will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years and increase income taxes payable. Tax law determines whether future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability. The deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate primarily to U.S. federal and state tax jurisdictions.On a quarterly basis, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.This assessment, which is completed on a taxing jurisdiction basis, takes into account both positive and negative evidence. A recent history of financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of objectively verifiable negative evidence. Cumulative pre-tax losses in the three-year period ending with the current quarter is considered to be significant negative evidence regarding future profitability. If cumulative pre-tax losses adjusted for non-recurring items result in positive normalized earnings that would be considered an objectively verifiable source of positive evidence of the ability of the company to generate positive earnings in the future. When there is a recent history of operating losses and negative normalized earnings and a return to operating profitability has not yet been demonstrated, we cannot rely on projections of future earnings for purposes of assessing recoverability of our deferred tax assets. In such cases, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. The selection of methodologies and assessment of when temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts involves significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective. We believe that the methodologies we use are reasonable and can be replicated on a consistent basis in future periods.As described above, a recent history of financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of objectively verifiable negative evidence of the Company’s ability to generate future taxable income to recover deferred tax assets. During 2019 and 2020 the Company generated significant losses and in the fourth quarter of 2020 the Company reached a three-year cumulative pre-tax loss position. We expect cumulative three-year losses to grow in 2021 as record earnings in 2018 are replaced by 2021 results. We also normalized earnings and other comprehensive income for certain non-recurring items and expect to reach a three-year cumulative loss position in 2021 as record earnings in 2018 are replaced with 2021 results. For purposes of assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets, the Company determined that it could not include future projected earnings in the analysis due to recent history of losses.Deferred tax liabilities represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amounts during the next five years. Deferred tax assets include amounts 58Table of Contentsrelated to pension and other postretirement benefits that are assumed to generate significant deductible amounts beyond five years. The Company’s valuation allowance of $3,094 million at December 31, 2020 primarily relates to pension and other postretirement benefit obligation deferred tax assets that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversals of deferred tax liabilities are assumed to occur. Because the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations are recorded to both continuing operations and other comprehensive income (OCI), the Company recorded a portion of the fourth quarter increase in the valuation allowance to income tax expense in continuing operations ($2,513 million) and a portion to OCI ($196 million).If the Company continues to generate losses and negative normalized earnings in future periods, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impacts on earnings and/or OCI. When income generation returns to more normal levels we can expect to see the allowance reverse and increase reported earnings and/or OCI.For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Financial Statements.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate RiskWe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed- and floating-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. In the first quarter of 2020, we entered into a $13.8 billion two-year delayed draw floating-rate term loan credit agreement. An increase or decrease of 100 basis points in interest rates on this floating-rate debt would increase or decrease our pre-tax earnings by $138 million over the next 12 months. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2020, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $245 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.Commodity Price RiskWe are subject to commodity price risk relating to commodity purchase contracts for items used in production that are subject to changes in the market price. We use commodity swaps and commodity purchase contracts to hedge against these potentially unfavorable price changes. Our commodity purchase contracts and derivatives are both sensitive to changes in the market price. At December 31, 2020, a 10% increase or decrease in the market price in our commodity derivatives would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $38 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts 59Table of Contentsto neutralize the effect of market price fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these commodity purchase contracts and the offsetting swaps do not create material market risk.60Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:09.725855
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations and Financial ConditionOverviewWe are a global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS) and Global Services (BGS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders. BCA is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, safety, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. BGS provides support for commercial and defense through innovative, comprehensive and cost-competitive product and service solutions. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.Business Environment and TrendsThe global outbreak of COVID-19, 787 production issues and associated rework, and the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding continued to have significant adverse impacts on our business in 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented shock to demand for air travel, creating a tremendous challenge for our customers, our business and the entire commercial aerospace manufacturing and services sector. The latest International Air Transport Association (IATA) release reported that passenger traffic in 2021 recovered to approximately 40% of 2019 levels, as international markets saw continued reopening challenges. Additionally, global economic activity is improving, but continues to be impacted by COVID-19, and governments continue to restrict travel to contain the spread of the virus. While recovery is accelerating, we continue to expect that it will remain uneven as travel restrictions and varying regional travel protocols continue to impact air travel.Generally, we continue to expect domestic travel to recover faster than international travel. As a result, we expect the narrow-body market to recover faster than the wide-body market. Also, the pace of the commercial market recovery will be heavily dependent on COVID-19 infection rates, vaccination rates, and government travel and other restrictions on trade and commercial activity. Demand for dedicated freighters continues to be strong, underpinned by a strong recovery in global trade and overall air cargo growth. Overall cargo capacity remains challenged given the large impact that COVID-19 has had on international passenger operations, which also carry cargo.23Table of ContentsAirline financial performance, which also plays a role in the demand for new capacity, has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to IATA, net losses for the airline industry were $138 billion in 2020 and are expected to be approximately $52 billion in 2021. Our customers are taking actions to combat the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the market by preserving liquidity. This comes in many forms, such as deferrals of advances and other payments to suppliers, deferrals of deliveries, reduced spending on services and, in some cases, cancellation of orders. While the outlook is improving and we have seen an increase in new orders in 2021, we continue to face a challenging environment in the near- to medium-term as airlines have adjusted to reduced traffic, which in turn has resulted in lower demand for commercial aerospace products and services. The current environment is also affecting the financial viability of some airlines.We continue to expect commercial air travel to return to 2019 levels in 2023 to 2024. We expect it will take a few years beyond that for the industry to return to long-term trend growth. To balance the supply and demand given the COVID-19 shock and to preserve our long-term potential and competitiveness, we have reduced the production rates of several of our BCA programs. These rate decisions are based on our ongoing assessments of the demand environment and availability of aircraft financing. There is significant uncertainty with respect to when commercial air traffic levels will recover, and whether, and at what point, capacity will return to and/or exceed pre-COVID-19 levels. During the fourth quarter of 2020, we made adjustments to our estimates regarding timing of 777X entry into service and market demand. We continue to anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. We will closely monitor the key factors that affect backlog and future demand for each of our commercial aircraft programs, including customers’ evolving fleet plans, the wide-body replacement cycle and the cargo market. We will maintain a disciplined rate management process and make adjustments as appropriate in the future. Notwithstanding the changes we have made to production rates, risk remains that further reductions will be required. Additionally, if we are unable to make timely deliveries of the large number of aircraft in inventory as of December 31, 2021, future revenues, earnings and cash flows will be adversely impacted.Deliveries of the 737 MAX resumed in the fourth quarter of 2020, when the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rescinded the order that grounded 737 MAX aircraft in the U.S. In addition, other non-U.S. civil aviation authorities, including the Brazilian National Civil Aviation Agency, Transport Canada and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency have subsequently approved return of operations, allowing us to resume deliveries in those jurisdictions. Over 185 countries have approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued an airworthiness directive in the fourth quarter of 2021 outlining actions required for airlines to return to service. We expect 737 MAX deliveries to China to resume in 2022, subject to final regulatory approvals, although risk remains around the timing and rate of those deliveries. Orders to suspend operations of 737 MAX aircraft from non-U.S. civil aviation authorities are still in effect in a small number of countries.Deliveries and production have also been impacted by production issues and associated rework. For example, deliveries of the 787 are currently paused and the production rate has been reduced while we focus on rework of undelivered aircraft and continue to engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming deliveries. Risk remains that these issues may continue to impact the timing of airplane deliveries in inventory and/or our ability to achieve planned production rates. Revenues, earnings and cash flows will continue to be impacted until we are able to resume timely deliveries.24Table of ContentsThe long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth, increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. The shock from COVID-19 has reduced the near- to medium-term demand, but our Commercial Market Outlook forecast projects a 4% growth rate for passenger and cargo traffic over a 20 year period. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.7% average annual gross domestic product (GDP) growth, we project demand for approximately 43,610 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics and increased global environmental regulations.A Continuing Resolution (CR), enacted on December 3, 2021, continues funding for the federal government at FY21 appropriated levels through February 18, 2022. Congress and the President must enact either full-year FY22 appropriations bills or an additional CR to fund government departments and agencies beyond February 18, 2022 or a government shutdown could result, which may impact the Company’s operations.At BGS, while the outlook is improving, we are continuing to see a direct impact on our commercial supply chain business as fewer flights and more aircraft parked result in a decreased demand for our parts and logistics offerings. Additionally, our commercial customers are curtailing discretionary spending, such as modifications and upgrades, and focusing on required maintenance. Similar to BCA, we expect a multi-year recovery period for the commercial services business. The demand outlook for our government services business remains stable; government services comprises approximately half of BGS revenue, which is unchanged from pre-pandemic levels.At BDS, we continue to see a healthy market with solid demand for our major platforms and programs both domestically and internationally. However, while we continue to experience near-term production disruptions and inefficiencies due to COVID-19 impacts, we saw improvements in 2021.In addition, we are experiencing some supply chain shortages. Our suppliers are also experiencing liquidity pressures and disruptions to their operations as a result of COVID-19. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain as we ramp up production. These measures and disruptions have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.We continue to transform and improve our business processes. These activities are not intended to constrain our capacity but to enable the Company to emerge stronger and be more resilient when the market recovers. We expect that successful execution of these measures will improve near-term liquidity and long-term cost competitiveness.25Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations The following table summarizes key indicators of consolidated results of operations:(Dollars in millions, except per share data)Years ended December 31,202120202019Revenues$62,286 $58,158 $76,559 GAAPLoss from operations($2,902)($12,767)($1,975)Operating margins(4.7)%(22.0)%(2.6)%Effective income tax rate14.8 %17.5 %71.8 %Net loss attributable to Boeing Shareholders($4,202)($11,873)($636)Diluted loss per share($7.15)($20.88)($1.12)Non-GAAP (1)Core operating loss($4,075)($14,150)($3,390)Core operating margins(6.5 %)(24.3 %)(4.4 %)Core loss per share($9.44)($23.25)($3.47)(1)These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense.

BCA revenues increased by $3,331 million primarily driven by higher 737 MAX deliveries due to recertification and return to service in most jurisdictions and the absence of $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations which reduced revenues in 2020, partially offset by lower 787 deliveries in 2021. BDS revenues increased by $283 million primarily from higher revenue on the KC-46A Tanker program and lower charges in 2021. BGS revenues increased by $785 million primarily due to higher commercial and government services volume.Revenues decreased by $18,401 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower revenues in our commercial airplanes and commercial services businesses. Revenues for each of our segments have been adversely impacted by COVID-19. BCA revenues decreased by $16,093 million due to lower deliveries driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, 787 production issues and the 737 MAX grounding, offset by lower charges related to estimated potential concessions and other considerations to 737 MAX customers. BDS revenues increased by $162 million primarily due to higher fighter aircraft 26Table of Contentsand other volume, partially offset by the impact of higher unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, largely due to KC-46A Tanker charges in 2020. BGS revenues decreased by $2,925 million primarily due to lower commercial services revenue driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. The changes in Unallocated items, eliminations and other primarily reflect the timing of eliminations for intercompany aircraft deliveries, as well as reserves related to cost accounting litigation recorded in 2019.Revenues will continue to be significantly impacted until deliveries ramp up and the commercial airline industry recovers from the impacts of COVID-19.Loss From Operations The following table summarizes Loss from operations:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202120202019Commercial Airplanes($6,475)($13,847)($6,657)Defense, Space & Security1,544 1,539 2,615 Global Services2,017 450 2,697 Boeing Capital106 63 28 Segment operating loss(2,808)(11,795)(1,317)Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment882 1,024 1,071 Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment291 359 344 Unallocated items, eliminations and other(1,267)(2,355)(2,073)Loss from operations (GAAP)($2,902)($12,767)($1,975)FAS/CAS service cost adjustment * (1,173)(1,383)(1,415)Core operating loss (Non-GAAP) **($4,075)($14,150)($3,390)* The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments.** Core operating earnings is a Non-GAAP measure that excludes the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. See pages 49 - 51.Loss from operations decreased by $9,865 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to lower losses at BCA and higher earnings at BGS. BCA loss from operations decreased by $7,372 million primarily due to the absence of a $6,493 million reach-forward loss on the 777X program recorded in 2020, lower period expenses, lower 737 MAX customer considerations and higher 737 MAX deliveries, partially offset by a $3,460 million reach-forward loss on the 787 program in 2021. BGS earnings from operations increased by $1,567 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to charges incurred in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as higher commercial services volume.Loss from operations increased by $10,792 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to increased losses at BCA and decreased earnings at BGS and BDS. BCA loss from operations increased by $7,190 million. The loss in 2020 primarily reflects a reach-forward loss recorded in the fourth quarter of $6,493 million on the 777X program. BCA’s loss in 2020 also reflects the absence of MAX deliveries during the first three quarters of the year, lower wide-body deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and 787 production issues, abnormal production costs, 737NG frame fitting component repair costs, severance costs and 737 MAX customer considerations.The loss in 2019 primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations. BDS earnings 27Table of Contentsdecreased by $1,076 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to higher unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, including charges of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B in 2020, partially offset by $489 million of charges on Commercial Crew in 2019. The lower earnings were also driven by lower gains on property sales compared to 2019. BGS earnings from operations decreased by $2,247 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower commercial services revenue, as well as asset impairments and severance costs resulting from the COVID-19 market environment.Lower commercial airplane deliveries and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins until deliveries ramp up and return to historical levels.Core operating loss decreased by $10,075 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to lower losses at BCA and higher earnings at BGS, as described above.Core operating loss increased by $10,760 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to higher losses at BCA and lower earnings at BGS and BDS.Unallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202120202019Share-based plans($174)($120)($65)Deferred compensation(126)(93)(174)Amortization of previously capitalized interest(107)(95)(89)Research and development expense, net(184)(240)(401)Customer financing impairment(250)Litigation(109)Eliminations and other unallocated items(676)(1,807)(985)Unallocated items, eliminations and other($1,267)($2,355)($2,073)Share-based plans expense increased by $54 million in 2021 and $55 million in 2020. The higher expense in 2021 was primarily related to a one-time grant of restricted stock units (RSUs) to most employees in December 2020. The increase in 2020 was due to increased grants of RSUs and other share-based compensation.Deferred compensation expense increased by $33 million in 2021, primarily driven by changes in our stock price, and decreased by $81 million in 2020, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price.Research and development expense decreased by $56 million in 2021 and $161 million in 2020 primarily due to decreases in enterprise investments in product development.In 2019, we recorded a $250 million charge related to the impairment of lease incentives with one customer that experienced liquidity issues and a $109 million charge related to ongoing litigation associated with recoverable costs on U.S. government contracts.Eliminations and other unallocated expense decreased by $1,131 million in 2021 and increased by $822 million in 2020 primarily due to earnings charges of $744 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 in anticipation of the agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice that was finalized in January 2021 and higher income from operating investments in 2021.

The pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in Loss from operations in 2020 was largely consistent with 2019. Net periodic benefit cost included in Loss from operations in 2021 was largely consistent with 2020. The decrease in net periodic benefit cost included in Loss from operations in 2020 was primarily due to prior year service cost that was included in earnings in 2019.For additional discussion related to Postretirement Plans, see Note 16 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Other Earnings Items(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202120202019Loss from operations($2,902)($12,767)($1,975)Other income, net551 447 438 Interest and debt expense(2,682)(2,156)(722)Loss before income taxes(5,033)(14,476)(2,259)Income tax benefit743 2,535 1,623 Net loss from continuing operations(4,290)(11,941)(636)Less: net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest(88)(68)Net loss attributable to Boeing Shareholders($4,202)($11,873)($636)Non-operating pension income included in Other income, net was $528 million in 2021, $340 million in 2020 and $374 million in 2019. The increased income in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to lower interest cost and higher expected return on plan assets, partially offset by higher amortization of net actuarial losses and higher settlement charges. The decreased income in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and lower asset returns, partially offset by lower interest cost.Non-operating postretirement income included in Other income, net was $1 million in 2021, compared with expense of $16 million in 2020 and $107 million in 2019. The increased income in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to lower interest cost. The decreased expense in 2020 compared to 2019 was due to lower interest cost.Interest and debt expense increased by $526 million in 2021 and increased by $1,434 million in 2020 as a result of higher average debt balances.For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.29Table of ContentsTotal Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. For long-term contracts, the amount reported as cost of sales is recognized as incurred. Substantially all contracts at our BDS segment and certain contracts at our BGS segment are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Cost of sales for commercial spare parts is recorded at average cost.The following table summarizes cost of sales:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 3120212020Change20202019ChangeCost of sales$59,269 $63,843 ($4,574)$63,843 $72,093 ($8,250)Cost of sales as a % of Revenues95.2 %109.8 %(14.6)%109.8 %94.2 %15.6 %Cost of sales decreased by $4,574 million in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to higher earnings charges at BCA, BDS and BGS in 2020, partially offset by higher costs as a result of higher revenues in 2021 and the reach-forward loss on the 787 program. Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher earnings charges at BCA and BGS in 2020 and higher revenues in 2021.Cost of sales decreased by $8,250 million in 2020 compared with 2019, primarily due to lower revenue in 2020, partially offset by higher charges in 2020 related to the 777X program, COVID-19 impacts, KC-46A Tanker program, abnormal production costs at BCA and severance costs. Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues increased in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the reach-forward loss on the 777X program, impacts of the 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as severance costs.Research and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202120202019Commercial Airplanes$1,140 $1,385 $1,956 Defense, Space & Security818 713 741 Global Services107 138 121 Other184 240 401 Total$2,249 $2,476 $3,219 Research and development expense decreased by $227 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to lower BCA and enterprise investments in product development and lower spending on the 777X program.Research and development expense decreased by $743 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to lower spending at BCA and at Boeing NeXt on product development.30Table of ContentsBacklogOur backlog at December 31 was as follows:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,20212020Commercial Airplanes$296,882 $281,588 Defense, Space & Security59,828 60,847 Global Services20,496 20,632 Unallocated items, eliminations and other293 337 Total Backlog$377,499 $363,404 Contractual backlog$356,362 $339,309 Unobligated backlog21,137 24,095 Total Backlog$377,499 $363,404 Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2021 was primarily due to new orders, reclassifications from unobligated backlog related to BDS and BGS contracts, increases in price escalation and reductions in the number of existing orders that in our assessment do not meet the accounting requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 for inclusion in backlog, partially offset by deliveries and cancellations. During 2021, we have had higher ASC 606 adjustments of 787 orders as a result of delivery delays related to inspections and rework. If 787 aircraft deliveries continue to be paused, we remain unable to deliver 737 MAX aircraft in China for an extended period of time, and/or entry into service of the 777X, 737 MAX 7 and/or 737 MAX 10 is further delayed, we may experience additional reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations. Additionally, we may continue to experience fewer new orders and increased cancellations across all of our commercial airplane programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand.Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2021 was primarily due to reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS and BGS contracts, partially offset by contract awards.Additional ConsiderationsGlobal Trade We continually monitor the global trade environment in response to geopolitical economic developments, as well as changes in tariffs, trade agreements or sanctions that may impact the company.The global economy continues to experience significant adverse impacts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a decline in overall trade in general and in aerospace in particular. There is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the duration, scale and localization of these impacts to the global economy and governments are enacting a wide range of responses to mitigate the unfolding economic impacts. We are closely monitoring the current impact and potential future economic consequences of COVID-19 to the global economy, the aerospace sector and our Company. These adverse economic impacts have resulted in fewer orders than previously anticipated for our commercial aircraft.31Table of ContentsThe current state of U.S.-China relations remains a significant watch item. China is a very significant market for commercial airplanes and represents a significant component of our commercial airplanes backlog. Since 2018, the U.S. and China imposed an escalating series of tariffs on each other’s imports. Certain aircraft parts and components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. The U.S. and China entered into a Phase I agreement in January 2020. However, as of December 31, 2021, implementation of this agreement is incomplete and overall diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China have deteriorated. We continue monitoring developments for potential adverse impacts to the Company.Beginning in June 2018, the U.S. Government has imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several major U.S. trading partners have imposed, or announced their intention to impose, tariffs on U.S. goods. In May 2019, the U.S. Government, Mexico and Canada reached an agreement to end the steel and aluminum tariffs between these countries. Implementation of the U.S./Mexico/Canada Free Trade Agreement (USMCA) will also result in lower tariffs. In October 2021, the U.S. and European Union (EU) announced an agreement to ease steel and aluminum tariffs. We continue to monitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from the remaining global tariffs.The current status of U.S.-Russia relations is creating an adverse climate for our business. The U.S. Government continues to impose and/or consider imposing sanctions on certain businesses and individuals in Russia. We continue to monitor and evaluate additional sanctions and export restrictions that may be imposed by the U.S. Government and any responses from Russia that could directly affect our supply chain, business partners or customers. We also continue to support the 737 MAX return to service in Russia.The U.S. and EU have been engaged in two long-running disputes at the World Trade Organization (WTO) relating to large civil aircraft. As part of those disputes, in October 2019, the WTO authorized the U.S. to impose approximately $7.50 billion in annual tariffs on EU products in connection with the EU’s provision of eight instances of launch aid subsidies to Airbus. Following this authorization, the U.S. began to impose 15% tariffs on new Airbus airplanes imported into the U.S. as well as fuselages that Airbus manufactures in Europe and imports into the U.S. In October 2020, the WTO authorized the EU to impose approximately $3.99 billion in annual tariffs on U.S. products in connection with a tax incentive used by Boeing in Washington state that has since been repealed. Shortly thereafter, the EU began to impose 15% tariffs on Boeing airplanes imported into the EU. On June 15, 2021, the U.S. and EU announced that they had reached a cooperative framework to address the large civil aircraft disputes. As part of the framework, among other items, both sides announced an intent to continue to suspend tariffs related to the disputes for five years. The U.S. and U.K. announced a similar agreement on June 17, 2021.Segment Results of Operations and Financial ConditionCommercial AirplanesBusiness Environment and TrendsAirline Industry Environment See Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.Industry Competitiveness The industry continues to adjust to the unprecedented COVID-19 shock and subsequent economic impact, government restrictions and new regulations. The commercial airplane market and the airline industry both remain extremely competitive. While the impacts and responses have varied globally, the reduction of demand and disruption in production has adversely impacted most manufacturers in the commercial airplane industry.32Table of ContentsContinued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 80% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. The grounding of the 737 MAX and the associated suspension of 737 MAX deliveries in multiple jurisdictions significantly reduced our market share with respect to deliveries of single aisle aircraft in 2019, 2020 and 2021 and may provide competitors with an opportunity to obtain more orders and increase market share. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. After the acquisition of a majority share of Bombardier’s C Series (now A220) in 2018, Airbus continues to expand in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market. Other competitors are also in different phases of developing commercial jet aircraft. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without broad commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Competitors continue to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.We are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our business transformation efforts, which enhances our ability to compete and positions us for market recovery. We are also focused on taking actions to ensure that Boeing is not harmed by unfair subsidization of competitors.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202120202019Revenues$19,493 $16,162 $32,255 % of total company revenues31 %28 %42 %Loss from operations($6,475)($13,847)($6,657)Operating margins(33.2)%(85.7)%(20.6)%Research and development$1,140 $1,385 $1,956 Revenues BCA revenues increased by $3,331 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to higher 737 MAX deliveries driven by recertification and return to service in most jurisdictions and the absence of charges for 737 MAX customer considerations which reduced revenues in 2020, partially offset by lower 787 deliveries in 2021.BCA revenues decreased by $16,093 million in 2020 compared with 2019 due to lower deliveries primarily driven by the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, 787 production issues and the 737 MAX grounding. This was partially offset by lower charges related to estimated potential concessions and other considerations to 737 MAX customers of $498 million in 2020 compared with $8,259 million in 2019.We resumed deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft in December 2020 following rescission by the FAA of its grounding order. As of December 31, 2021, most non-U.S. jurisdictions have approved return to service of the 737 MAX. 787 deliveries have been paused since May 2021. Revenues will continue to be impacted until deliveries of the 737 MAX ramp up, deliveries of the 787 resume and the commercial airline industry recovers from the impacts of COVID-19.33Table of ContentsCommercial Airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows:737 *747 767 *777 †787 Total2021Cumulative deliveries7,7451,5671,2381,6771,006Deliveries263(16)732(13)24143402020Cumulative deliveries7,4821,5601,2061,653992Deliveries43(14)530(11)26531572019Cumulative deliveries7,4391,5551,1761,627939Deliveries127(19)743(23)45(2)158380* Intercompany deliveries identified by parentheses† Aircraft accounted for as revenues by BCA and as operating leases in consolidation identified by parenthesesLoss From Operations BCA loss from operations was $6,475 million in 2021 compared with $13,847 million in 2020. The 2021 loss includes a reach-forward loss on the 787 program of $3,460 million, abnormal production costs related to 737 MAX of $1,887 million, and abnormal production costs related to the 787 program of $468 million resulting from continued production issues, inspections and rework, partially offset by higher 737 MAX deliveries. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million and additional drivers as noted in the paragraph below.BCA loss from operations was $13,847 million in 2020 compared with $6,657 million in 2019. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million, lower deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, $2,567 million of abnormal production costs related to 737 MAX, $623 million of severance cost, $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations, $336 million related to 737NG frame fitting component repair costs and $270 million of abnormal production costs in the first half of 2020 from the temporary suspension of operations in response to COVID-19, partially offset by lower research and development spending. Lower 787 margins reflecting a reduction in the accounting quantity in the first quarter of 2020 also contributed to lower earnings. The 2019 loss primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations.Lower commercial airplane deliveries and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins until deliveries ramp up and return to historical levels.BacklogOur total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders as well as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. We address customer 34Table of Contentsclaims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of ASC 606.BCA total backlog of $296,882 million at December 31, 2021 increased from $281,588 million at December 31, 2020, reflecting new orders in excess of deliveries, increases in projected price escalation and decreases in the number of existing orders that in our assessment do not meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog, partially offset by aircraft order cancellations. Aircraft order cancellations during the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $27,542 million and primarily relate to 737 MAX and 787 aircraft. The net ASC 606 adjustments decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021, which resulted in an increase to backlog of $3,810 million primarily due to 777X aircraft, partially offset by 787 aircraft. ASC 606 adjustments include consideration of aircraft orders where a customer controlled contingency may exist, as well as an assessment of whether the customer is committed to perform or whether it is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. If 787 aircraft deliveries continue to be paused, we are unable to ramp up deliveries of 737 MAX aircraft, and/or if entry into service of the 777X, 737 MAX 7 and/or 737 MAX 10 is further delayed, we may experience additional reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations. Additionally, we may continue to experience fewer new orders and increased cancellations across all of our commercial airplane programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand.Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.35Table of ContentsThe following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. Firm orders include military derivative aircraft that are not included in program accounting quantities. All revenues and costs associated with military derivative aircraft production are reported in the BDS segment.Program737 747 767 777 777X787 †2021Program accounting quantities10,4001,5741,2431,750350 1,500Undelivered units under firm orders3,414610858253411(14)Cumulative firm orders11,1591,5731,3461,7352531,4172020Program accounting quantities10,0001,5741,2071,7003501,500Undelivered units under firm orders3,28287541191458(22)Cumulative firm orders10,7641,5681,2811,6941911,4502019Program accounting quantities10,4001,5741,1951,690**1,600Undelivered units under firm orders4,398179468309520(29)Cumulative firm orders11,8371,5721,2701,6953091,459† Aircraft ordered by BCC are identified in parentheses.** See 777 and 777X Programs for discussion of the 777X accounting quantity.Program Highlights737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 400 units during 2021 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. See further discussion of the 737 MAX in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.747 Program We are currently producing at a rate of 0.5 aircraft per month. We expect to complete production of the 747 in the second half of 2022. We believe that ending production of the 747 will not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 36 units during 2021 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the tanker program. The commercial program has near break-even gross margins. We are currently producing at a rate of 3 aircraft per month.777 and 777X Programs The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2021 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The production rate for the combined 777/777X program is expected to increase from 2 per month to 3 per month in 2022.In 2013, we launched the 777X-8 and 777X-9, which feature new composite wings, new engines and folding wing-tips. The first flight of the 777X was completed during the first quarter of 2020. In 2021, we began offering the 777X freighter to customers and expect to receive initial orders in 2022.During the fourth quarter of 2020, we revised the estimated first delivery date of the 777X to late 2023 and recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program. The revised schedule and reach-36Table of Contentsforward loss reflected a number of factors, including an updated assessment of global certification requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and a management decision in the fourth quarter of 2020 to make modifications to the aircraft’s design, an updated assessment of COVID-19 impacts on market demand and discussions with our customers with respect to aircraft delivery timing. These factors resulted in adjustments to production rates and the program accounting quantity, increased change incorporation costs, and associated customer and supply chain impacts. The initial accounting quantity of 350 airplanes established in the fourth quarter of 2020 consists of 777X passenger airplanes and remained unchanged during 2021.We are working towards reaching Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) which will enable us to begin FAA certification flight testing. The timing of TIA and certification will ultimately be determined by the regulators, and further determinations with respect to anticipated certification requirements could result in additional delays in entry into service and/or additional cost increases.We continue to anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. The 777X program has near break-even gross margins at December 31, 2021. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods.787 Program During 2020, we experienced significant reductions in deliveries due to the impacts of COVID-19 on our customers as well as production issues and associated rework. During 2021 we delivered 14 aircraft between March 2021 and May 2021 prior to deliveries being paused in May 2021. Deliveries remain paused.At December 31, 2021 and 2020 we had approximately 110 and 80 aircraft in inventory. We have identified production quality issues, including in our supply chain, which have contributed to the pause in deliveries. In July 2021, we announced that we were reprioritizing production resources to support inspections and rework. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on undelivered aircraft and engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming delivery of the 787. We are currently producing at very low rates and expect that to continue until deliveries resume, gradually returning to 5 per month over time. In the third quarter of 2021, we determined that in the current environment production rates below 5 per month represent abnormally low production rates and result in abnormal production costs, and that inspections and rework costs on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for as abnormal production costs that are required to be expensed as incurred. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined that the ongoing rework, as well as our ongoing discussions with the FAA in anticipation of resumption of deliveries, will result in lower production rates longer than previously expected. As a result of these impacts, we expect to incur approximately $2 billion of abnormal production costs on a cumulative basis with most being incurred by the end of 2023. We continue to work with customers and suppliers regarding timing of future deliveries and production rate changes. We are also continuing to implement changes in the production process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections and rework. During the first quarter of 2021, we consolidated 787 production in South Carolina, in line with our previous assumptions, which did not have a significant financial impact on the program.During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the program primarily due to the additional rework, as well as other actions required to resume 787 deliveries, taking longer than 37Table of Contentsexpected. These impacts have resulted in longer than expected delivery delays and associated customer considerations.The timing of the resumption of deliveries and future production rates will depend upon rework, ongoing customer and supplier engagement, production stability and our activities with the FAA. China is a significant market for the 787 program, and if the program is unable to obtain additional orders from China in future quarters, we may be required to further adjust production rate assumptions. If we are required to further reduce the accounting quantity and/or production rates, experience further delivery delays or experience other factors that result in lower margins, the program could record additional losses and higher abnormal production costs in future periods.Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.Program Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.Go-ahead and Initial Delivery737 MAX 720112022737 MAX 1020172023777X20132023Reflects models in development during 2021The development schedules shown above are subject to a number of uncertainties, including changes in certification requirements. The timing of certifications will ultimately be determined by the regulators.Additional ConsiderationsThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging, such as the 787 production issues and associated rework. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X and 737 MAX derivatives, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. These challenges include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, the addition of regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates 38Table of Contentsincorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.Defense, Space & SecurityBusiness Environment and TrendsUnited States Government Defense Environment OverviewIn May 2021, the U.S. government released the President’s budget request for fiscal year 2022 (FY22), which included $715 billion in funding for the United States Department of Defense (U.S. DoD), $25 billion in funding for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and $19 billion for the FAA. While the President’s budget request for FY22 includes funding for a majority of Boeing’s programs, it did not include funding for F/A-18 Super Hornet, P-8 Poseidon and CH-47F Block II production aircraft. While there is continued congressional support for F/A-18 and CH-47F Block II production aircraft for FY22, there is ongoing uncertainty with respect to these and other program-level appropriations for FY22 and future fiscal years. These programs also continue to pursue non-U.S. sales opportunities.In December 2021, Congress passed and the President signed the National Defense Authorization Act for FY22, which authorizes a U.S. DoD budget $25 billion higher than the budget request. A CR, enacted on December 3, 2021, continues funding for the federal government at FY21 appropriated levels through February 18, 2022. Congress and the President must enact either full-year FY22 appropriations bills or an additional CR to fund government departments and agencies beyond February 18, 2022 or a government shutdown could result, which may impact the Company’s operations. Alternatively, Congress may continue to fund the federal government through one or more additional CRs, however, this would continue to restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions.Accordingly, there continues to be uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD and other government agencies, including NASA, for FY22 and beyond. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows.Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2021, 33% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202120202019Revenues$26,540 $26,257 $26,095 % of total company revenues43 %45 %34 %Earnings from operations$1,544 $1,539 $2,615 Operating margins5.8 %5.9 %10.0 %39Table of ContentsSince our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular period may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, including remanufactures and modifications were as follows:Years ended December 31,202120202019F/A-18 Models21 20 23 F-15 Models16 4 11 C-17 Globemaster III1 CH-47 Chinook (New)15 27 13 CH-47 Chinook (Renewed)5 3 22 AH-64 Apache (New)27 19 37 AH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)56 52 74 KC-46 Tanker13 14 28 P-8 Models16 15 18 C-40A2 Total169 154 229 Revenues BDS revenues in 2021 increased by $283 million compared with 2020 primarily due to higher revenue on the KC-46A Tanker program due to new orders for 27 aircraft received during the first quarter of 2021 and lower charges in 2021. This was partially offset by lower revenues on rotorcraft programs, Commercial Crew and VC-25B. Cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 were $56 million less unfavorable than the prior year, largely due to the lower charges described below.BDS revenues in 2020 increased by $162 million compared with 2019 reflecting higher revenues from fighter aircraft, Space Launch System, B-52 upgrades, proprietary and MQ-25, partially offset by reduced volume in missile defense. These net increases were offset by the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $312 million higher than the comparable period in the prior year, largely due to the KC-46A Tanker charges during 2020.Earnings From Operations BDS earnings from operations in 2021 increased by $5 million compared with 2020 primarily due to less unfavorable impacts from cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which improved $219 million from the prior year, largely due to lower KC-46A Tanker charges in 2021 compared to 2020 and other charges in development programs described below. The favorable change in cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was offset primarily by lower volume and mix on rotorcraft programs and lower equity earnings for United Launch Alliance (ULA).During the fourth quarter of 2021, BDS increased the reach-forward loss on the KC-46A Tanker program by $402 million primarily due to continued disruption in the factory and in the supply chain, including impacts of COVID-19, and an increase in costs to complete the new Remote Vision System as the customer’s requirements definition has evolved. In 2020, we recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $1,320 million on the KC-46A Tanker program reflecting $551 million of costs associated 40Table of Contentswith the agreement signed in April 2020 with the U.S. Air Force to develop and integrate the new Remote Vision System, and costs for production inefficiencies including impacts of COVID-19 disruption.During the third quarter of 2021, we increased the reach-forward loss on Commercial Crew by $185 million driven by the delay in the second uncrewed Orbital Flight Test now anticipated in 2022 and the latest assessment of remaining work.During the first quarter of 2021, we increased the reach-forward loss on VC-25B by $318 million, which was largely due to COVID-19 impacts and performance issues at a key supplier. The $168 million reach-forward loss in the first quarter of 2020 on VC-25B was associated with engineering inefficiencies from the COVID-19 environment.BDS earnings from operations in 2020 decreased by $1,076 million compared with 2019 primarily due to the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $828 million higher than the prior year, largely due to higher charges in 2020 of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B, offset by $489 million in charges on Commercial Crew in 2019. The lower earnings in 2020 also reflect lower gains on property sales compared to the same period in 2019. These current period decreases were partially offset by the volume increases described above.BDS earnings from operations includes our share of income or loss from equity method investments of $53 million, $141 million and $128 million primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.BacklogTotal backlog of $59,828 million at December 31, 2021 was $1,019 million lower than December 31, 2020 due to the timing of awards and revenue recognized.Additional ConsiderationsOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis, and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed-price proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.41Table of ContentsGlobal ServicesBusiness Environment and TrendsThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; training and professional services; and information services. Prior to COVID-19, we had expected the market to grow by around 3.5% annually, however, the pandemic is having a direct impact on our commercial services business. See Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.Over the long-term, as the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of airplanes. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.The demand outlook for our government services business has remained stable in 2021. Government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we expect U.S. growth to remain flat and non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at the fastest rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability.BGS’ major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 39, which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions.Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202120202019Revenues$16,328 $15,543 $18,468 % of total company revenues26 %27 %24 %Earnings from operations$2,017 $450 $2,697 Operating margins12.4 %2.9 %14.6 %Revenues BGS revenues in 2021 increased by $785 million compared with 2020 due to higher commercial and government services volume. While commercial services volume is recovering, it remains below pre-pandemic levels. The net favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 was $37 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year. We expect the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to have an adverse impact on BGS commercial revenues in future quarters until the commercial airline industry environment fully recovers.42Table of ContentsBGS revenues in 2020 decreased by $2,925 million compared with 2019 due to lower commercial services revenue driven by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2020 was $101 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year.Earnings From Operations BGS earnings from operations in 2021 increased by $1,567 million compared with 2020, primarily due to charges incurred in 2020 driven by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher commercial services volume in 2021, partially offset by an inventory write-down of $220 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by revised cost estimates on certain customer contracts. Charges in 2020 included $531 million of inventory write-downs, $178 million of related impairments of distribution rights primarily driven by airlines’ decisions to retire certain aircraft, $398 million for higher expected credit losses primarily driven by customer liquidity issues, $115 million of contract termination and facility impairment charges, and $72 million of severance costs. The net favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 was $98 million lower than the prior year.BGS earnings from operations in 2020 decreased by $2,247 million compared with 2019, primarily due to lower commercial services revenue as well as the 2020 earnings charges described in the previous paragraph. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2020 was consistent with the prior year.BacklogBGS total backlog of $20,496 million at December 31, 2021 decreased by 1% from $20,632 million at December 31, 2020, primarily due to revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.Boeing CapitalBusiness Environment and TrendsBCC’s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 totaled $1,734 million. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is composed of customers that have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.BCC provided customer financing of $14 million during 2020 and none during 2021. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2021 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources.Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 5,300 western-built commercial jet aircraft (20.5% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2021, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, a larger portion are expected to be retired compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, which directly impacts the Company in terms of number of new aircraft deliveries and financing opportunities, the ability of existing customers to meet current payment obligations and the value of aircraft in its portfolio. We continue to work closely with our customers to mitigate the risk. At the end of 2020 and 2019, 29.4% and 8.5% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. See Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.43Table of ContentsResults of Operations(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202120202019Revenues$272 $261 $244 Earnings from operations$106 $63 $28 Operating margins39 %24 %11 %Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2021 increased by $11 million compared with 2020, and revenues in 2020 increased by $17 million compared with 2019 primarily due to gains on re-lease of assets, partially offset by portfolio run-off.Earnings From Operations BCC’s earnings from operations are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Earnings from operations in 2021 increased by $43 million compared with 2020 primarily due to higher revenues, lower provision for losses, and lower interest and asset impairment expenses. Earnings from operations in 2020 increased by $35 million compared with 2019 primarily due to higher revenues, lower asset impairment expenses and lower interest expenses.Financial PositionThe following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31:(Dollars in millions)20212020Customer financing and investment portfolio, net$1,720 $1,961 Other assets, primarily cash and short-term investments462 402 Total assets$2,182 $2,363 Other liabilities, primarily income taxes$347 $392 Debt, including intercompany loans1,525 1,640 Equity310 331 Total liabilities and equity$2,182 $2,363 Debt-to-equity ratio4.9-to-15-to-1BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 decreased from December 31, 2020, primarily due to $241 million of note payoffs and portfolio run-off.BCC enters into certain transactions with other Boeing segments, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.44Table of ContentsLiquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow Summary(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202120202019Net loss($4,290)($11,941)($636)Non-cash items7,851 10,866 2,819 Changes in assets and liabilities(6,977)(17,335)(4,629)Net cash used by operating activities(3,416)(18,410)(2,446)Net cash provided/(used) by investing activities9,324 (18,366)(1,530)Net cash (used)/provided by financing activities(5,600)34,955 5,739 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(39)85 (5)Net increase/(decrease) in cash & cash equivalents, including restricted269 (1,736)1,758 Cash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at beginning of year7,835 9,571 7,813 Cash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at end of year$8,104 $7,835 $9,571 Operating Activities Net cash used by operating activities was $3.4 billion during 2021, compared with $18.4 billion during 2020 and $2.4 billion during 2019. The reduction in cash used by operating activities in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily driven by lower net loss and improved changes in assets and liabilities. Non-cash items in 2021 include the $3.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 787 program which was recorded as a reduction to inventory, as well as $1.2 billion of treasury shares issued to fund Company contributions to the 401(k) plan and $0.8 billion of share-based plans expense reflecting a one-time stock grant to most employees in lieu of 2021 salary increases. The changes in assets and liabilities reflect the significant increase in commercial airplane inventory in 2020 driven by lower deliveries due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAX grounding. In 2021, inventory growth slowed as the continued buildup of 787 aircraft caused by production issues and 777X inventory growth was partially offset by a decrease in 737 MAX inventory following the resumption of deliveries. Compensation payments to 737 MAX customers totaled $2.5 billion and $2.2 billion in 2021 and 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we paid $0.7 billion consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice. Additionally, in 2021, we received income tax refunds of $1.7 billion. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $2.5 billion in 2021, as compared with Cash used by Advances and progress billings of $1.1 billion in 2020. The pause in 787 deliveries and the residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding are expected to continue to have a significant impact on our operating cash flows until 787 deliveries resume and 737 MAX deliveries ramp up.The decrease in operating cash flows in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily driven by our net loss in 2020 and changes in assets and liabilities, partially offset by an increase in non-cash items. Non-cash items include the $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program in 2020, which was recorded as a reduction to inventory. The year-over-year increase in non-cash items also reflects higher inventory write-downs and higher allowances for expected credit losses in 2020. The changes in assets and liabilities reflect increases in commercial airplane inventory due to the large number of undelivered aircraft in 2019 resulting from the 737 MAX grounding, and in 2020 due to the 737 MAX grounding, 787 production issues and COVID-19 impacts. Cash used by Advances and progress billings was $1.1 billion in 2020, as compared with $0.7 billion provided by Advances and progress billings in 2019. The changes in assets and liabilities in 2020 also reflect lower accounts payable due to reductions in commercial purchases from suppliers and lower supply chain financing. Compensation payments to 737 MAX customers totaled $2.2 billion during 2020 and $1.2 billion during 2019. The accrued liability 45Table of Contentsfor 737 MAX customer considerations at December 31, 2019 resulted in a $7.4 billion favorable change to assets and liabilities in 2019.Payables to suppliers who elected to participate in supply chain financing programs declined by $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and increased by $2.6 billion in 2019. Supply chain financing is not material to our overall liquidity. The declines for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were primarily due to reductions in commercial purchases from suppliers. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2019 reflects a combination of higher purchases, an extension of payment terms with certain suppliers and increased utilization of our supply chain financing programs.Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities during 2021 was $9.3 billion, compared with cash used by investing activities of $18.4 billion and $1.5 billion during 2020 and 2019. The increase in cash inflows in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to $27.1 billion of higher net proceeds from investments. The increase in cash outflows in 2020 compared to 2019 is primarily due to $17.4 billion of higher net contributions to investments. Net proceeds from investments were $9.8 billion in 2021, compared with net contributions to investments of $17.3 billion in 2020 and net proceeds from investments of $0.1 billion in 2019. Capital expenditures totaled $1.0 billion in 2021, compared with $1.3 billion in 2020 and $1.8 billion in 2019. We reduced our capital expenditures in 2021 and 2020 as we managed our liquidity throughout the pandemic and 737 MAX grounding. We expect capital expenditures in 2022 to be higher than in 2021.Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $5.6 billion during 2021, compared with cash provided by financing activities of $35.0 billion during 2020 and $5.7 billion in 2019. The decrease of $40.6 billion compared with 2020 primarily reflects net debt repayments in 2021 compared with net borrowings in 2020. The increase of $29.3 billion in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily reflects higher net borrowings, lower share repurchases and lower dividend payments, which reflects the Company’s decision in March 2020 to suspend the declaration or payment of dividends until further notice. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, debt repayments net of new borrowings were $5.6 billion, primarily due to $13.8 billion of repayments of our two-year delayed draw term loan credit agreement, partially offset by $9.8 billion of fixed rate senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2021. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, new borrowings net of repayments were $36.3 billion, primarily due to $29.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes issued in 2020 and $13.8 billion of new borrowings under a two-year delayed draw term loan agreement entered into in the first quarter of 2020. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, new borrowings net of repayments were $13.2 billion, primarily due to the issuance of $10.5 billion of fixed rate senior notes in 2019. For further discussion see Liquidity Matters in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.At December 31, 2021 and 2020 debt balances totaled $58.1 billion and $63.6 billion, of which $1.3 billion and $1.7 billion were classified as short-term. This included $1.5 billion and $1.6 billion of debt attributable to BCC at December 31, 2021 and 2020, of which $0.3 billion and $0.9 billion were classified as short-term.During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not repurchase any shares through our open market share repurchase program compared to repurchases of 6.9 million shares in 2019 totaling $2.7 billion. Share repurchases under this plan have been suspended since April 2019. In March 2020, the Board of Directors terminated its prior authorization to repurchase shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. We had 0.3 million, 0.6 million and 0.6 million shares transferred to us from employee tax withholdings in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid no dividends, compared with $1.2 billion and $4.6 billion in 2020 and 2019. In March 2020, the Company announced that our dividend will be suspended until further notice.46Table of ContentsCapital Resources The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, 787 production issues and associated rework, and residual impacts of the 737 MAX grounding are having a significant negative impact on our liquidity and ongoing operations and creating significant uncertainty. We have and are continuing to take significant actions to manage and preserve our liquidity. For further discussion see Liquidity Matters in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.The following table summarizes certain cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2021, and the estimated timing thereof.

At December 31, 2021, we had $8.1 billion of cash, $8.2 billion of short-term investments, and $14.7 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these revolving credit lines will remain undrawn and primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Of the $14.7 billion of unused borrowing capacity, $6.3 billion expires in October 2022, $5.3 billion expires in March 2023 and $3.2 billion expires in October 2024.Our debt balances have increased significantly since 2019, and we are continuing to actively manage our liquidity. In 2021, we repaid $13.8 billion that was outstanding under our two-year delayed draw term loan credit agreement that had a final maturity date of February 6, 2022.Our increased debt balance resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings in 2020, and our ratings remained unchanged in 2021. We expect to be able to access capital markets when we require additional funding in order to pay off existing debt, address further impacts to our business related to market developments, fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, including impacts described above related to the COVID-19 pandemic and/or associated changes in demand for our products and services. These risks will be particularly acute if we are subject to further credit rating downgrades. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and financing or contractual commitments.Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. At December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements) and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined in the credit agreements). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.47Table of ContentsPension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our pension plans were $7.8 billion and $13.7 billion underfunded as measured under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP). On an ERISA basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2021. We do not expect to make significant contributions to our pension plans in 2022. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.In the fourth quarter of 2020, we contributed $3 billion of our common stock to our pension fund. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we also began using our common stock in lieu of cash to fund Company contributions to our 401(k) plans for the foreseeable future. Under this approach, common stock is contributed to our 401(k) plans following each pay period. We expect this measure to further enable the Company to conserve cash. We have retained an independent fiduciary to manage and liquidate stock contributed to these plans at its discretion.Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, customer financing equipment and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts with customers and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2021, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2021, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements 48Table of Contentstotaling $25.5 billion that extend through 2034. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Commercial CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2021.(Dollars in millions)Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of LossLess than1 year1-3years4-5yearsAfter 5yearsStandby letters of credit and surety bonds$3,634 $1,969 $1,451 $60 $154 Commercial aircraft financing commitments12,905 2,034 6,094 2,904 1,873 Total commercial commitments$16,539 $4,003 $7,545 $2,964 $2,027 Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Customer financing commitments totaled $12.9 billion and $11.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The increase relates to new financing commitments. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Contingent ObligationsWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $605 million at December 31, 2021. For additional information, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-GAAP MeasuresCore Operating Earnings, Core Operating Margin and Core Earnings Per ShareOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/49Table of ContentsCAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustments recognized in Loss from operations were benefits of $882 million in 2021, $1,024 million in 2020 and $1,071 million in 2019. The lower benefits in 2021 were primarily due to reductions in allocated pension cost year over year. The non-operating pension expense included in Other income, net was a benefit of $528 million in 2021, $340 million in 2020 and $374 million in 2019. The higher benefits in 2021 were primarily due to lower interest cost and higher expected return on plan assets, partially offset by higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher settlement charges. The benefits in 2020 and 2019 reflect expected returns in excess of interest cost and amortization of actuarial losses.For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs, see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on page 29 of this Form 10-K and see Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.50Table of ContentsReconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP MeasuresThe table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of earnings from operations, operating margins and diluted earnings per share.(Dollars in millions, except per share data)Years ended December 31, 202120202019Revenues$62,286 $58,158 $76,559 Loss from operations, as reported($2,902)($12,767)($1,975)Operating margins(4.7)%(22.0)%(2.6)%Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)($882)($1,024)($1,071)Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)(291)(359)(344)FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)($1,173)($1,383)($1,415)Core operating loss (non-GAAP)($4,075)($14,150)($3,390)Core operating margins (non-GAAP)(6.5)%(24.3)%(4.4)%Diluted loss per share, as reported($7.15)($20.88)($1.12)Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)(1.50)(1.80)(1.89)Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)(0.49)(0.63)(0.61)Non-operating pension expense(2)(0.91)(0.60)(0.66)Non-operating postretirement expense(2)0.03 0.19 Provision for deferred income taxes on adjustments (3)0.61 0.63 0.62 Core loss per share (non-GAAP)($9.44)($23.25)($3.47)Weighted average diluted shares (in millions)588.0 569.0 566.0 (1)FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments.

Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.Accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, COVID-19 disruptions, asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements.Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments across all long-term contracts increased loss from operations by $880 million, $942 million and $111 million, respectively. The cumulative catch-up adjustments in 2021 were primarily due to losses recognized on the KC-46A Tanker, VC-25B and Commercial Crew programs. These are all fixed-price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1% during 2021, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $300 million.Program AccountingProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate revenues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates.52Table of ContentsFactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, COVID-19 disruptions, and inflationary or deflationary trends.To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. This includes reassessing the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program, a loss is recorded in the current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.The 747, 767 and 777X programs have near break-even margins, and the 787 program has zero margin at December 31, 2021. Adverse changes to the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in additional earnings charges in future periods.777X Program During the fourth quarter of 2020, we revised the estimated first delivery date of the 777X to late 2023 and recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program. The revised schedule and reach-forward loss reflected a number of factors, including an updated assessment of global certification requirements informed by continued discussions with regulators and a management decision in the fourth quarter of 2020 to make modifications to the aircraft’s design, an updated assessment of COVID-19 impacts on market demand and discussions with our customers with respect to aircraft delivery timing. These factors resulted in adjustments to production rates and the program accounting quantity, increased change incorporation costs, and associated customer and supply chain impacts. The initial accounting quantity of 350 airplanes established in the fourth quarter of 2020 consists of 777X passenger airplanes and remained unchanged during 2021.We are working towards reaching TIA which will enable us to begin FAA certification flight testing. The timing of TIA and certification will ultimately be determined by the regulators, and further determinations with respect to anticipated certification requirements could result in additional delays in entry into service and/or additional cost increases.We continue to anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. The 777X program has near break-even gross margins at December 31, 2021. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods, which may be material.53Table of Contents787 Program The 787 program’s production issues and delivery pause result in significant uncertainties regarding the revenue and cost estimates for the 787 program. Deliveries have remained paused since May 2021. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the program primarily due to rework driving longer delivery delays than were previously expected and associated customer considerations. The estimate of customer considerations is based on a number of factors, including our current assumptions regarding timing of FAA approval enabling resumption of deliveries, estimated timing of completion of inspections and rework to enable deliveries in future periods, estimated timing of production rate increases as well as customer and market assessments. We continue to conduct inspections and rework and engage in detailed discussions with the FAA regarding required actions for resuming delivery of the 787. Our program revenue and cost estimates reflect the assumption that production rates will remain very low until deliveries resume, gradually returning to 5 per month over time. We have also assumed lower forecasted revenues due to delayed deliveries. Our program assumptions reflect our current best estimate. However, if the program experiences further delivery delays or other factors such as additional inspections or rework that result in lower revenue or higher cost estimates, we could record additional losses in future periods, which may be material.Goodwill ImpairmentsWe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or quantitative test. If we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of the reporting unit. If we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the reporting unit, then a quantitative test is performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. For reporting units where the quantitative test is used, we compare the carrying value of net assets to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, the shortfall up to the carrying value of the goodwill represents the amount of goodwill impairment.We generally estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a combination of discounted cash flows and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales, operating costs and changes in working capital. These forecasts reflect existing firm orders, expected future orders, expected production rates and delivery profiles, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.We completed our annual assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2021 and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill. As of December 31, 2021, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts, discount rates or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods.Pension PlansMany of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. Nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. Additional union employees transitioned to company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plans effective January 1, 2019. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected 54Table of Contentsoutcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.The projected benefit obligation is sensitive to discount rates. The projected benefit obligation would decrease by $2,240 million or increase by $2,530 million if the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on pension cost. However, net periodic pension cost is sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2021 net periodic pension cost by $155 million. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which includes the discount rate and expected long-term rate of asset return assumptions for the last three years.Deferred Income Taxes – Valuation AllowanceThe Company has deferred income tax assets of $11,258 million at December 31, 2021 that can be used in future years to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable. The Company has deferred income tax liabilities of $8,976 million at December 31, 2021 that will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years and increase income taxes payable. Tax law determines whether future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability.On a quarterly basis, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.This assessment takes into account both positive and negative evidence. A recent history of financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of objectively verifiable negative evidence. Due to our recent history of losses, we determined we could not include future projected earnings in our analysis. Rather, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. The selection of methodologies and assessment of when temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts involves significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective. We believe that the methodologies we use are reasonable and can be replicated on a consistent basis in future periods.Deferred tax liabilities represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amounts during the next five years. Deferred tax assets include amounts related to pension and other postretirement benefits that are assumed to generate significant deductible amounts beyond five years. The Company’s valuation allowance of $2,423 million at December 31, 2021 primarily relates to pension and other postretirement benefit obligation deferred tax assets that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversals of deferred tax liabilities are assumed to occur. During 2021, the Company decreased the valuation allowance by $671 primarily due to favorable pension remeasurement. Until the Company generates sustained levels of profitability, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impacts on earnings and/or other comprehensive income.For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.55Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate RiskWe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed- and floating-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. In 2021, we repaid the $13.8 billion outstanding under our two-year floating-rate delayed draw term loan credit agreement. As a result, as of December 31, 2021, we do not have any significant floating-rate debt obligations. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2021, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $241 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.Commodity Price RiskWe are subject to commodity price risk relating to commodity purchase contracts for items used in production that are subject to changes in the market price. We use commodity swaps and commodity purchase contracts to hedge against these potentially unfavorable price changes. Our commodity purchase contracts and derivatives are both sensitive to changes in the market price. At December 31, 2021, a 10% increase or decrease in the market price in our commodity derivatives would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $46 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of market price fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these commodity purchase contracts and the offsetting swaps do not create material market risk.56Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:02.345119
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsConsolidated Results of Operations and Financial ConditionOverviewWe are a global market leader in the design, development, manufacture, sale, service and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in an expanding number of countries and rely on an extensive network of non-U.S. partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes (BCA), Defense, Space & Security (BDS) and Global Services (BGS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that enable our investments in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands, and continue to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality to provide a fair return for our shareholders. BCA is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, safety, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security, space and services to deliver capability-driven solutions to customers at reduced costs. Our BDS strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. BGS provides support for commercial and defense through innovative, comprehensive and cost-competitive product and service solutions. BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our Boeing customers.Business Environment and TrendsDomestic travel continues to recover from the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic before international travel and the narrow-body market continues to follow domestic travel recovery, while the wide-body market continues to be paced by international travel recovery. The pace of the commercial market recovery remains impacted by government restrictions related to COVID-19, especially China. We are seeing a strong recovery in travel demand for our airline customers in North and South America, the Middle East, and Europe, and demand for dedicated freighters continues to be underpinned by a strong recovery in global trade.We and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of the lingering impacts of COVID-19, global supply chain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain as we ramp up production. These factors have reduced overall productivity and adversely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.Airline financial performance, which influences demand for new capacity, has been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the International Air Transport Association (IATA), net losses for the airline industry were $138 billion in 2020 and $42 billion in 2021. IATA also forecasts $6.9 billion of losses for the industry globally in 2022, with approximately $9.9 billion of profits in North America driven by the robust domestic market being more than offset by losses in other regions. For 2023, IATA is forecasting $4.6 billion in profits for the industry globally. While the outlook continues to improve, we continue to face a challenging environment in the near- to medium-term as airlines are facing increased fuel and other costs, and the global economy is experiencing high inflation. The current environment is also affecting the financial viability of some airlines.20Table of ContentsThe long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel demand: economic growth, increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our Commercial Market Outlook forecast projects a 3.8% growth rate for passenger and cargo traffic over a 20-year period. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.6% in average annual gross domestic product, we project demand for approximately 41,170 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics and increased global environmental regulations.During 2022, commercial services volume at BGS recovered to pre-pandemic levels. We expect BGS commercial revenues to remain strong in future quarters as the commercial airline industry continues to recover. The demand outlook for our government services business remains stable.At BDS, we continue to see stable demand reflecting the important role our products and services have in ensuring our national security. Outside of the U.S., we are seeing similar solid demand as governments prioritize security, defense technology and global cooperation given evolving threats. We continue to experience near-term production disruptions and inefficiencies due to supplier disruption, labor instability and factory performance. These factors have contributed to significant earnings charges on a number of fixed-price development programs which are expected to adversely affect cash flows in future periods.As a result of the war in Ukraine, we recorded earnings charges totaling $212 million during the first quarter of 2022, primarily related to asset impairments. We have closed our facilities in Russia. We are focused on the safety of our employees and retaining the strength of our engineering talent through voluntary transfers to other countries. We have also suspended our business in Russia, including parts, maintenance and technical support for Russian airlines, and purchases from Russian suppliers. We are complying with U.S. and international sanctions and export control restrictions. We have sufficient material and parts to avoid production disruptions in the near-term, but future impacts to our production from disruptions in our supply chain are possible. The war in Ukraine continues to impact our airline and lessor customers. We continue to monitor developments and potential Boeing impacts, and take mitigating actions as appropriate.21Table of ContentsConsolidated Results of Operations The following table summarizes key indicators of consolidated results of operations:(Dollars in millions, except per share data)Years ended December 31,202220212020Revenues$66,608 $62,286 $58,158 GAAPLoss from operations($3,547)($2,902)($12,767)Operating margins(5.3)%(4.7)%(22.0)%Effective income tax rate(0.6)%14.8 %17.5 %Net loss attributable to Boeing Shareholders($4,935)($4,202)($11,873)Diluted loss per share($8.30)($7.15)($20.88)Non-GAAP (1)Core operating loss($4,690)($4,075)($14,150)Core operating margins(7.0 %)(6.5 %)(24.3 %)Core loss per share($11.06)($9.44)($23.25)(1)These measures exclude certain components of pension and other postretirement benefit expense.

BCA revenues increased by $6,374 million primarily driven by higher 737 and 787 deliveries. BGS revenues increased by $1,283 million primarily due to higher commercial services volume, partially offset by lower government services volume and performance. BDS revenues decreased by $3,378 million primarily due to charges on development programs, unfavorable performance across other defense programs, and lower P-8 and weapons volume. Revenues increased by $4,128 million in 2021 compared with 2020 driven by higher revenues at BCA, BDS and BGS. BCA revenues increased by $3,331 million primarily driven by higher 737 MAX deliveries due to recertification and return to service in most jurisdictions and the absence of $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations which reduced revenues in 2020, partially offset by lower 787 deliveries in 2021. BDS revenues increased by $283 million primarily from higher revenue on the 22Table of ContentsKC-46A Tanker program and lower charges in 2021. BGS revenues increased by $785 million primarily due to higher commercial and government services volume.Revenues will continue to be significantly impacted until the global supply chain stabilizes, labor instability diminishes, and deliveries ramp up.Loss From Operations The following table summarizes Loss from operations:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202220212020Commercial Airplanes($2,370)($6,475)($13,847)Defense, Space & Security(3,544)1,544 1,539 Global Services2,727 2,017 450 Boeing Capital29 106 63 Segment operating loss(3,158)(2,808)(11,795)Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment849 882 1,024 Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment294 291 359 Unallocated items, eliminations and other(1,532)(1,267)(2,355)Loss from operations (GAAP)($3,547)($2,902)($12,767)FAS/CAS service cost adjustment * (1,143)(1,173)(1,383)Core operating loss (Non-GAAP) **($4,690)($4,075)($14,150)* The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments.** Core operating loss is a non-GAAP measure that excludes the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. See pages 45 - 47.Loss from operations increased by $645 million in 2022 compared with 2021. BDS had a loss from operations of $3,544 million compared with earnings of $1,544 million during 2021, primarily due to charges on development programs. BCA loss from operations decreased by $4,105 million primarily due to the absence in 2022 of the $3,460 million reach-forward loss taken on the 787 program in 2021, higher 737 deliveries and lower abnormal production costs, partially offset by higher research and development spending, charges related to the war in Ukraine and other period expenses. BGS earnings from operations increased by $710 million in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to higher commercial services volume and favorable mix, partially offset by lower government services performance. Loss from operations decreased by $9,865 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to lower losses at BCA and higher earnings at BGS. BCA loss from operations decreased by $7,372 million primarily due to the absence of a $6,493 million reach-forward loss on the 777X program recorded in 2020, lower period expenses, lower 737 MAX customer considerations and higher 737 MAX deliveries, partially offset by a $3,460 million reach-forward loss on the 787 program in 2021. BGS earnings from operations increased by $1,567 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to charges incurred in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as higher commercial services volume.Core operating loss increased by $615 million in 2022 compared with 2021 and decreased by $10,075 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to changes in Segment operating loss as described above.23Table of ContentsUnallocated Items, Eliminations and Other The most significant items included in Unallocated items, eliminations and other are shown in the following table:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202220212020Share-based plans($114)($174)($120)Deferred compensation117 (126)(93)Amortization of previously capitalized interest(95)(107)(95)Research and development expense, net(278)(184)(240)Eliminations and other unallocated items(1,162)(676)(1,807)Unallocated items, eliminations and other($1,532)($1,267)($2,355)Share-based plans expense decreased by $60 million in 2022 and increased by $54 million in 2021. The lower expense in 2022 compared to 2021 was due to decreased grants of restricted stock units (RSUs) and other share-based compensation. The higher expense in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily related to a one-time grant of RSUs to most employees in December 2020. Deferred compensation expense decreased by $243 million in 2022, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions, and increased by $33 million in 2021, primarily driven by changes in broad stock market conditions and our stock price.Research and development expense increased by $94 million in 2022 and decreased by $56 million in 2021 primarily due to enterprise investments in product development.Eliminations and other unallocated expense increased by $486 million in 2022 primarily due to a $200 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission related to the 737 MAX accidents, lower income from operating investments, and an increase in environmental remediation expense. Eliminations and other unallocated expense decreased by $1,131 million in 2021 primarily due to earnings charges of $744 million in the fourth quarter of 2020 in anticipation of the agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice that was finalized in January 2021 and higher income from operating investments in 2021.Net periodic pension benefit costs included in Loss from operations were as follows:(Dollars in millions)PensionYears ended December 31,202220212020Allocated to business segments($852)($885)($1,027)Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment849 882 1,024 Net periodic pension benefit cost included in Loss from operations($3)($3)($3)The pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment recognized in Loss from operations in 2022 decreased by $33 million compared with 2021 and decreased by $142 million in 2021 compared with 2020 due to reductions in allocated pension cost year over year. Net periodic benefit cost included in Loss from operations in 2022 was largely consistent with 2021 and 2020.

The increased income in 2022 compared to 2021 was primarily due to lower amortization of net actuarial losses in 2022 and a settlement loss recorded in 2021. The increased income in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to lower interest cost and higher expected return on plan assets, partially offset by higher amortization of net actuarial losses and higher settlement charges.Non-operating postretirement income included in Other income, net was $58 million in 2022, compared with income of $1 million in 2021 and expense of $16 million in 2020. The increased income in 2022 and 2021 was due to lower amortization of net actuarial losses. Interest and debt expense decreased by $149 million in 2022 primarily due to lower average debt balances and increased by $526 million in 2021 as a result of higher average debt balances.In August 2022, the President signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which contained provisions effective January 1, 2023, including a 15% corporate minimum tax and a 1% excise tax on stock buybacks, both of which we do not expect to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Total Costs and Expenses (“Cost of Sales”)Cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. Our BCA segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales. Under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial aircraft program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. For long-term contracts, the amount reported as cost of sales is recognized as incurred. Substantially all contracts at our BDS segment and certain contracts at our BGS segment are long-term contracts with the U.S. government and other customers that generally extend over several years. Cost of sales for commercial spare parts is recorded at average cost.25Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes cost of sales:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 3120222021Change20212020ChangeCost of sales$63,106 $59,269 $3,837 $59,269 $63,843 ($4,574)Cost of sales as a % of Revenues94.7 %95.2 %(0.5)%95.2 %109.8 %(14.6)%Cost of sales increased by $3,837 million in 2022 compared with 2021, primarily due to charges recorded at BDS and higher revenues at BCA. Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues remained largely consistent in 2022 compared to 2021.Cost of sales decreased by $4,574 million in 2021 compared with 2020, primarily due to higher earnings charges at BCA, BDS and BGS in 2020, partially offset by higher costs as a result of higher revenues in 2021 and the reach-forward loss on the 787 program. Cost of sales as a percentage of Revenues decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to higher earnings charges at BCA and BGS in 2020 and higher revenues in 2021.Research and Development The following table summarizes our Research and development expense:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202220212020Commercial Airplanes$1,510 $1,140 $1,385 Defense, Space & Security945 818 713 Global Services119 107 138 Other278 184 240 Total$2,852 $2,249 $2,476 Research and development expense increased by $603 million in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to higher research and development expenditures on 777X, 737 MAX, as well as BCA and enterprise investments in product development.Research and development expense decreased by $227 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to lower BCA and enterprise investments in product development and lower spending on the 777X program.26Table of ContentsBacklogOur backlog at December 31 was as follows:(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,20222021Commercial Airplanes$329,824 $296,882 Defense, Space & Security54,373 59,828 Global Services19,338 20,496 Unallocated items, eliminations and other846 293 Total Backlog$404,381 $377,499 Contractual backlog$381,977 $356,362 Unobligated backlog22,404 21,137 Total Backlog$404,381 $377,499 Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2022 was primarily due to an increase in BCA backlog that was partially offset by a decrease in BDS backlog. If we remain unable to deliver 737 MAX aircraft in China for an extended period of time, and/or entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10 is further delayed, we may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The increase in unobligated backlog in 2022 was primarily due to contract awards, partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS and BGS contracts.Additional ConsiderationsGlobal Trade We continually monitor the global trade environment in response to geopolitical economic developments, as well as changes in tariffs, trade agreements or sanctions that may impact the Company.The current state of U.S.-China relations remains an ongoing watch item. Since 2018, the U.S. and China have imposed tariffs on each other’s imports. Certain aircraft parts and components that Boeing procures are subject to these tariffs. We are mitigating import costs through Duty Drawback Customs procedures. China is a significant market for commercial aircraft. Boeing has long-standing relationships with our Chinese customers, who represent a key component of our commercial aircraft backlog. Overall, the U.S.-China trade relationship remains stalled as economic and national security concerns continue to be a challenge.Beginning in June 2018, the U.S. Government imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. In response to these tariffs, several major U.S. trading partners have imposed, or announced their intention to impose, tariffs on U.S. goods. The U.S. has subsequently reached agreements with Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, and Japan to ease or remove tariffs on steel and/or aluminum. We continue to monitor the potential for any extra costs that may result from the remaining global tariffs.We are complying with all U.S. and other government export control restrictions and sanctions imposed on certain businesses and individuals in Russia. We continue to monitor and evaluate additional sanctions and export restrictions that may be imposed by the U.S. Government or other governments, 27Table of Contentsas well as any responses from Russia that could affect our supply chain, business partners or customers, for any additional impacts to our business.Segment Results of Operations and Financial ConditionCommercial AirplanesBusiness Environment and TrendsAirline Industry Environment See Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the airline industry environment.Industry Competitiveness The industry continues to recover from the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The commercial aircraft market and the airline industry both remain extremely competitive. While the impacts and responses have varied globally, the reduction of demand and disruption in production has adversely impacted most manufacturers in the commercial aircraft industry.Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 70% of Commercial Airplanes’ total backlog, in dollar terms, is with non-U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. The grounding of the 737 MAX in 2019 and the associated suspension of 737 MAX deliveries in multiple jurisdictions significantly reduced our market share with respect to deliveries of single aisle aircraft and may provide competitors with an opportunity to obtain more orders and increase market share. With government support, Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. After the acquisition of a majority share of Bombardier’s C Series (now A220) in 2018, Airbus continues to expand in the 100-150 seat transcontinental market. Other competitors are also in different phases of developing commercial jet aircraft, including Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (COMAC), which delivered its first C919 aircraft in 2022. Some of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the cost and commercial risks associated with airplane development activities. This has enabled the development of airplanes without broad commercial viability; others to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible; and many offered for sale below market-based prices. Competitors continue to make improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share and improving earnings. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.We are focused on improving our products and services and continuing our business transformation efforts, which enhances our ability to compete and positions us for market recovery. We are also focused on taking actions to ensure that Boeing is not harmed by unfair subsidization of competitors.28Table of ContentsResults of Operations (Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202220212020Revenues$25,867 $19,493 $16,162 % of total company revenues39 %31 %28 %Loss from operations($2,370)($6,475)($13,847)Operating margins(9.2)%(33.2)%(85.7)%Research and development$1,510 $1,140 $1,385 Revenues BCA revenues increased by $6,374 million in 2022 compared with 2021 primarily due to higher 737 and 787 deliveries in 2022.BCA revenues increased by $3,331 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to higher 737 MAX deliveries driven by recertification and return to service in most jurisdictions and the absence of charges for 737 MAX customer considerations which reduced revenues in 2020, partially offset by lower 787 deliveries in 2021.BCA deliveries, including intercompany deliveries, as of December 31 were as follows:737 *747 767 *777 787 Total2022Cumulative deliveries8,1321,5721,2711,7011,037Deliveries387(13)533(15)24314802021Cumulative deliveries7,7451,5671,2381,6771,006Deliveries263(16)732(13)24143402020Cumulative deliveries7,4821,5601,2061,653992Deliveries43(14)530(11)2653157* Intercompany deliveries identified by parenthesesLoss From Operations BCA loss from operations was $2,370 million in 2022 compared with $6,475 million in 2021 reflecting higher 737 deliveries and lower abnormal production costs, partially offset by higher research and development spending, charges related to the war in Ukraine and other period expenses. The 2021 loss also reflects a reach-forward loss on the 787 program of $3,460 million. Abnormal production costs in 2022 were $1,753 million, including $1,240 million related to the 787 program, $325 million related to the 777X program, and $188 million related to the 737 program. BCA loss from operations was $6,475 million in 2021 compared with $13,847 million in 2020. The 2021 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on the 787 program of $3,460 million, abnormal production costs related to the 737 program of $1,887 million, and abnormal production costs related to the 787 program of $468 million resulting from continued production issues, inspections and rework, partially offset by higher 737 MAX deliveries. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on the 777X program of $6,493 million, lower deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, 29Table of Contents$2,567 million of abnormal production costs related to the 737 program, $623 million of severance cost, $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations, $336 million related to 737NG frame fitting component repair costs and $270 million of abnormal production costs in the first half of 2020 from the temporary suspension of operations in response to COVID-19, partially offset by lower research and development spending. Lower 787 margins reflecting a reduction in the accounting quantity in the first quarter of 2020 also contributed to lower earnings.BacklogOur total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer-controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly probable. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders as well as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies, including rights to reject individual airplane deliveries if the actual delivery date is significantly later than the contractual delivery date. We address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. The value of orders in backlog is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers and is reported in accordance with the requirements of ASC 606.BCA total backlog of $329,824 million at December 31, 2022 increased from $296,882 million at December 31, 2021, reflecting new orders in excess of deliveries and price escalation, offset by order cancellations and by an increase in the value of existing orders that in our assessment do not meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog. Aircraft order cancellations during the year ended December 31, 2022 totaled $11,251 million and relate to 737 and 787 aircraft. The net ASC 606 adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2022 resulted in a decrease to backlog of $4,675 million primarily due to a net increase of 777X aircraft in the ASC 606 reserve, partially offset by net decreases in 737 and 787 aircraft in the ASC 606 reserve. ASC 606 adjustments include consideration of aircraft orders where a customer-controlled contingency may exist, as well as an assessment of whether the customer is committed to perform, impacts of geopolitical events or related sanctions, or whether it is probable that the customer will pay the full amount of consideration when it is due. If we remain unable to deliver 737 MAX aircraft in China for an extended period of time, and/or entry into service of the 777X, 737-7 and/or 737-10 is further delayed, we may experience reductions to backlog and/or significant order cancellations.Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly.The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.30Table of ContentsThe following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. Firm orders include military derivative aircraft that are not included in program accounting quantities. All revenues and costs associated with military derivative aircraft production are reported in the BDS segment.Program737 747 767 777 777X787 †2022Program accounting quantities10,8001,5741,2671,790400 1,600Undelivered units under firm orders3,653110669244505(8)Cumulative firm orders11,7851,5731,3771,7702441,5422021Program accounting quantities10,4001,5741,2431,7503501,500Undelivered units under firm orders3,414610858253411(14)Cumulative firm orders11,1591,5731,3461,7352531,4172020Program accounting quantities10,0001,5741,2071,7003501,500Undelivered units under firm orders3,28287541191458(22)Cumulative firm orders10,7641,5681,2811,6941911,450† Aircraft ordered by BCC are identified in parentheses.Program Highlights737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 400 units during 2022 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We increased the production rate to 31 per month in 2022, and expect to implement further gradual production rate increases based on market demand and supply chain capacity. We expensed abnormal production costs of $188 million and $1,887 million during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Over 190 countries have approved the resumption of 737 MAX operations. The first 737 MAX passenger flight in China since 2019 occurred on January 13, 2023. There is uncertainty regarding timing of resumption of deliveries in China, which are still subject to final regulatory approvals. We continue to work with a small number of customers who have requested to defer deliveries or to cancel orders for 737 MAX aircraft, and we are remarketing and/or delaying deliveries of certain aircraft included within inventory.We have approximately 250 aircraft in inventory as of December 31, 2022, including approximately 140 aircraft in inventory that are designated for customers in China. We are remarketing some of these aircraft to other customers. We anticipate delivering most of the aircraft in inventory by the end of 2024. In the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveries in China or remarket those aircraft and/or ramp up deliveries consistent with our assumptions, our expectation of delivery timing could be impacted.31Table of ContentsThe 737-7 and 737-10 models are currently going through FAA certification. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023 amended Section 116 of the ACSAA, such that applications for original or amended type certifications that were submitted to the FAA prior to December 27, 2020, including those of the 737-7 and 737-10, are no longer subject to the crew alerting specifications of Section 116. Additionally, beginning one year after the FAA issues the type certificate for the 737-10, any new 737 MAX aircraft must include certain safety enhancements to be issued an original airworthiness certification by the FAA. These enhancements are included in Boeing’s application for the certification for the 737-10, and the sufficiency of these enhancements will be determined by the FAA. Beginning three years after the issuance of a type certificate for the 737-10, all previously delivered 737 MAX aircraft must be retrofitted with these safety enhancements. As the holder of the type certificate, Boeing is required to bear any costs of these safety enhancement retrofits. We have provisioned for the estimated costs associated with the safety enhancements and do not expect those costs to be material.We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification process, and currently expect the 737-7 to be certified and delivered in 2023, and the 737-10 to begin FAA certification flight testing in 2023 with first delivery in in 2024. At December 31, 2022, we had 27 737-7 and 3 737-10 aircraft in inventory and 236 737-7 and 720 737-10 aircraft in backlog and have delivered a total of 1,033 737 MAX aircraft. If we experience delays in achieving certification and/or incorporating safety enhancements, future revenues, cash flows and results of operations could be adversely impacted. See further discussion of the 737 MAX in Note 7 and Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.747 Program We completed production of the 747 in the fourth quarter of 2022 and delivery of the last aircraft is expected to occur in early 2023. Ending production of the 747 did not have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 24 units during 2022 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 767 assembly line includes the commercial program and a derivative to support the KC-46A Tanker program. The commercial program has near break-even gross margins. We are currently producing at a combined rate of 3 aircraft per month.777 and 777X Programs The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 40 units during 2022 due to the program's normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. We are currently producing at a combined production rate of 3 per month for the 777/777X programs. The accounting quantity for the 777X program increased by 50 units during 2022 reflecting the launch of the 777X-8 freighter during the first quarter of 2022. First delivery of the 777X-8 freighter is expected in 2027. During the first quarter of 2022, we revised the estimated first delivery date of the 777X-9, previously expected in late 2023, and now expect it will occur in 2025, based on an updated assessment of the time required to meet certification requirements. We are working towards Type Inspection Authorization (TIA) which will enable us to begin FAA certification flight testing. The timing of TIA and certification will ultimately be determined by the regulators, and further determinations with respect to anticipated certification requirements could result in additional delays in entry into service and/or additional cost increases.In April 2022, we decided to pause production of the 777X-9 during 2022 and 2023. We implemented the production pause during the second quarter of 2022, and it is expected to result in abnormal production costs of approximately $1.5 billion that are being expensed as incurred until 777X-9 production resumes. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $0.3 billion of abnormal costs were period expensed.32Table of ContentsThe 777X program had near break-even gross margins at December 31, 2022. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods.787 Program During the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased the accounting quantity for the 787 program by 100 units due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. The increase in the accounting quantity improved the program’s profit margin.We received FAA authorization to resume delivery on July 28, 2022 and deliveries resumed in August. During 2022, we delivered 31 aircraft to customers. We continue to conduct inspections and rework on undelivered aircraft. During 2021, we delivered 14 aircraft between March and May 2021 prior to deliveries being paused in May 2021 due to production quality issues including in our supply chain. We have implemented changes in the production process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections and rework. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, we had approximately 100 and 110 aircraft in inventory. Most of the aircraft in inventory at December 31, 2022 are expected to deliver by the end of 2024. We are currently producing at low rates and expect to gradually return to 5 per month in 2023. In the third quarter of 2021, we determined that production rates below 5 per month represented abnormally low production rates and result in abnormal production costs. We also determined that the inspections and rework costs on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for as abnormal production costs that are required to be expensed as incurred. Cumulative abnormal costs recorded through December 31, 2022 totaled $1.7 billion. During the fourth quarter of 2022 we adjusted the total estimate of abnormal production costs up to $2.8 billion with most being incurred by the end of 2023. At December 31, 2021, we were expecting to incur approximately $2 billion of abnormal production costs on a cumulative basis. The increase was primarily driven by a decision in the fourth quarter of 2022 to slow down near-term production due to supply chain constraints and increased inspection and rework costs. We continue to work with customers and suppliers regarding timing of future deliveries and production rate changes. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the program primarily due to the additional rework, as well as other actions required to resume 787 deliveries, taking longer than expected. These impacts have resulted in longer than expected delivery delays and associated customer considerations. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial aircraft with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.33Table of ContentsProgram Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.Go-ahead and Initial Delivery737-720112023737-1020172024777X-920132025777X-8F20222027Reflects models in development during 2022The development schedules shown above are subject to a number of uncertainties, including changes in certification requirements. The timing of certifications will ultimately be determined by the regulators.Additional ConsiderationsThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging, such as the 787 production issues and associated rework. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X, 737-7 and 737-10, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. These challenges include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. Factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, the addition of regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.34Table of ContentsDefense, Space & SecurityBusiness Environment and TrendsUnited States Government Defense Environment OverviewThe Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2023, enacted in December 2022, provided fiscal year 2023 (FY23) appropriations for government departments and agencies, including $817 billion for the U.S. DoD and $25.4 billion for NASA. The enacted FY23 appropriations included funding for Boeing’s major programs, including the F/A-18 Super Hornet, F-15EX, CH-47 Chinook, AH-64 Apache, V-22 Osprey, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, and the Space Launch System. The FY23 appropriations support F/A-18 production further into calendar year 2025. The FY23 appropriations did not include funding for additional P-8 aircraft. The P-8 program continues to pursue additional sales opportunities to extend production beyond 2024.There is ongoing uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the U.S. DoD, NASA and other government agencies for fiscal year 2024 and beyond. U.S. government discretionary spending, including defense spending, is likely to continue to be subject to pressure. Future budget cuts or investment priority changes, including changes associated with the authorizations and appropriations process, could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. Any of these impacts could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and/or cash flows.Non-U.S. Defense Environment Overview The non-U.S. market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories. BDS expects that it will continue to have a wide range of opportunities across Asia, Europe and the Middle East given the diverse regional threats. At the end of 2022, 28% of BDS backlog was attributable to non-U.S. customers.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202220212020Revenues$23,162 $26,540 $26,257 % of total company revenues35 %43 %45 %(Loss)/earnings from operations($3,544)$1,544 $1,539 Operating margins(15.3)%5.8 %5.9 %Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular period may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context.35Table of ContentsDeliveries of new-build production units, including remanufactures and modifications, were as follows:Years ended December 31,202220212020F/A-18 Models14 21 20 F-15 Models12 16 4 CH-47 Chinook (New)19 15 27 CH-47 Chinook (Renewed)9 5 3 AH-64 Apache (New)25 27 19 AH-64 Apache (Remanufactured)50 56 52 MH-139 Grey Wolf4 KC-46 Tanker15 13 14 P-8 Models12 16 15 Commercial Satellites4 Military Satellites1 Total165 169 154 Revenues BDS revenues in 2022 decreased by $3,378 million compared with 2021 primarily due to charges on development programs. Unfavorable performance across other defense programs and lower P-8 and weapons volume also contributed to the decrease in revenue. Cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2022 were $1,858 million more unfavorable than the prior year largely due to charges on development programs.BDS revenues in 2021 increased by $283 million compared with 2020 primarily due to higher revenue on the KC-46A Tanker program due to new orders for 27 aircraft received during the first quarter of 2021 and lower charges in 2021. This was partially offset by lower revenues on rotorcraft programs, Commercial Crew and VC-25B. Cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 were $56 million less unfavorable than the prior year, largely due to the lower charges described below.(Loss)/earnings From Operations BDS loss from operations in 2022 of $3,544 million decreased by $5,088 million compared with earnings from operations of $1,544 million in 2021 primarily due to unfavorable impacts of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments ($4,284 million more unfavorable in 2022 than 2021). Volume and mix and higher research and development also contributed to the year over year earnings decline. Charges of fixed price development programs in 2022 included VC-25B ($1,452 million), KC-46A Tanker ($1,374 million), MQ-25 ($579 million), T-7A Red Hawk Production Options ($552 million), T-7A Red Hawk Engineering, Manufacturing and Development (EMD) ($203 million), and Commercial Crew ($288 million). These were partially offset by charges on the KC-46A Tanker ($402 million), VC-25B ($318 million), and Commercial Crew ($214 million) recognized in 2021. The net unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments represent losses incurred on these development and other programs. See further discussion of fixed-price contracts in Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. BDS earnings from operations in 2021 of $1,544 million increased by $5 million compared with earnings from operations of $1,539 million in 2020 primarily due to less unfavorable impacts from cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which improved $219 million from the prior year, largely due to lower KC-46A Tanker charges in 2021 compared to 2020 and other charges on development programs. The $219 million change in cumulative contract catch-up adjustments was offset primarily by lower volume and mix on rotorcraft programs and lower equity earnings for United Launch Alliance (ULA). During 2020, BDS recorded charges on KC-46A Tanker ($1,320 million) and VC-25B ($168 million).36Table of ContentsBDS (loss)/earnings from operations includes our share of income from equity method investments of $13 million, $53 million and $141 million primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Earnings from our ULA joint venture increased in 2022, partially offset by losses on other operating investments.BacklogTotal backlog of $54,373 million at December 31, 2022 was $5,455 million lower than December 31, 2021 due to the timing of awards and revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.Additional ConsiderationsOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Some of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, T-7A Red Hawk, VC-25B, and commercial and military satellites. A number of our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.Global ServicesBusiness Environment and TrendsThe aerospace markets we serve include parts distribution, logistics and other inventory services; maintenance, engineering and upgrades; training and professional services; and data analytics and digital services. During 2022, commercial services volume at BGS recovered to pre-pandemic levels. We expect BGS commercial revenues to remain strong in future quarters as the commercial airline industry continues to recover.Over the long-term, as the size of the worldwide commercial airline fleet continues to grow, so does demand for aftermarket services designed to increase efficiency and extend the economic lives of aircraft. Airlines are using data analytics to plan flight operations and predictive maintenance to improve their productivity and efficiency. Airlines continue to look for opportunities to reduce the size and cost of their spare parts inventory, frequently outsourcing spares management to third parties.The demand outlook for our government services business has remained stable in 2022. Government services market segments are growing on pace with related fleets, but vary based on the utilization and age of the aircraft. The U.S. government services market is the single largest individual market, comprising over 50 percent of the government services markets served. Over the next decade, we 37Table of Contentsexpect U.S. growth to remain flat and non-U.S. fleets, led by Middle East and Asia Pacific customers, to add rotorcraft and commercial derivative aircraft at faster rates. We expect less than 20 percent of the worldwide fleet of military aircraft to be retired and replaced over the next ten years, driving increased demand for services to maintain aging aircraft and enhance aircraft capability.BGS’ major customer, the U.S. government, remains subject to the spending limits and uncertainty described on page 35, which could restrict the execution of certain program activities and delay new programs or competitions.Industry Competitiveness Aviation services is a competitive market with many domestic and international competitors. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales growth potential and long-term investment returns.Results of Operations (Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202220212020Revenues$17,611 $16,328 $15,543 % of total company revenues26 %26 %27 %Earnings from operations$2,727 $2,017 $450 Operating margins15.5 %12.4 %2.9 %Revenues BGS revenues in 2022 increased by $1,283 million compared with 2021 primarily due to higher commercial services volume, partially offset by lower government services volume and performance. The decrease in government services volume is partly driven by the discontinuation of an engine distribution agreement in the second quarter of 2022. The net favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2022 was $137 million lower than the prior year.BGS revenues in 2021 increased by $785 million compared with 2020 due to higher commercial and government services volume. The net favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 was $37 million lower than the prior year. Earnings From Operations BGS earnings from operations in 2022 increased by $710 million compared with 2021, primarily due to higher commercial services volume and favorable mix, partially offset by lower government services performance. The net unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2022 was $148 million worse than the net favorable impact in the prior year.BGS earnings from operations in 2021 increased by $1,567 million compared with 2020, primarily due to charges incurred in 2020 driven by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher commercial services volume in 2021, partially offset by an inventory write-down of $220 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by revised cost estimates on certain customer contracts. Charges in 2020 included $531 million of inventory write-downs, $178 million of related impairments of distribution rights primarily driven by airlines’ decisions to retire certain aircraft, $398 million for higher expected credit losses primarily driven by customer liquidity issues, $115 million of contract termination and facility impairment charges, and $72 million of severance costs. The net favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2021 was $98 million lower than the prior year.38Table of ContentsBacklogBGS total backlog of $19,338 million at December 31, 2022 decreased by 6% from $20,496 million at December 31, 2021, primarily due to revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.Boeing CapitalBusiness Environment and TrendsBCC’s gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2022 totaled $1,549 million. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is composed of customers that have less than investment-grade credit. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.BCC provided customer financing of $96 million during 2022 and none during 2021. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2023 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources.Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 4,950 western-built commercial jet aircraft (18.3% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2022, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, a larger portion are expected to be retired compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, which directly impacts the Company in terms of number of new aircraft deliveries and financing opportunities, the ability of existing customers to meet current payment obligations and the value of aircraft in its portfolio. We continue to work closely with our customers to mitigate the risk. At the end of 2021 and 2020, 20.5% and 29.4% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. See Overview to Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the airline industry environment.Results of Operations(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202220212020Revenues$199 $272 $261 Earnings from operations$29 $106 $63 Operating margins15 %39 %24 %Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease, interest income from financing receivables and notes, and other income. BCC’s revenues in 2022 decreased by $73 million compared with 2021 primarily due to lower gains on re-lease of assets.Earnings From Operations BCC’s earnings from operations is presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. In 2022, earnings from operations decreased by $77 million compared with 2021, primarily due to an increase in the allowance for losses on receivables as a result of the war in Ukraine and lower revenues. Earnings from operations in 2021 increased by $43 million compared with 2020 primarily due to higher revenues, lower provision for losses, and lower interest and asset impairment expenses. 39Table of ContentsFinancial PositionThe following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31:(Dollars in millions)20222021Customer financing and investment portfolio, net$1,494 $1,720 Other assets, primarily cash and short-term investments460 462 Total assets$1,954 $2,182 Other liabilities, primarily income taxes$239 $347 Debt, including intercompany loans1,425 1,525 Equity290 310 Total liabilities and equity$1,954 $2,182 Debt-to-equity ratio4.9-to-14.9-to-1BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2022 decreased $226 million from December 31, 2021, primarily due to portfolio run-off, partially offset by new volume.BCC enters into certain intercompany transactions, reflected in Unallocated items, eliminations and other, in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesCash Flow Summary(Dollars in millions)Years ended December 31,202220212020Net loss($5,053)($4,290)($11,941)Non-cash items4,426 7,851 10,866 Changes in assets and liabilities4,139 (6,977)(17,335)Net cash provided/(used) by operating activities3,512 (3,416)(18,410)Net cash provided/(used) by investing activities4,370 9,324 (18,366)Net cash (used)/provided by financing activities(1,266)(5,600)34,955 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents(73)(39)85 Net increase/(decrease) in cash & cash equivalents, including restricted6,543 269 (1,736)Cash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at beginning of year8,104 7,835 9,571 Cash & cash equivalents, including restricted, at end of year$14,647 $8,104 $7,835 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $3.5 billion during 2022, compared with net cash used by operating activities of $3.4 billion during 2021. The $6.9 billion improvement in cash provided by operating activities in 2022 is primarily driven by improved changes in assets and liabilities of $11.1 billion, partially offset by lower non-cash items of $3.4 billion and higher net loss of $0.8 billion. Changes in assets and liabilities for 2022 improved by $11.1 billion compared with 2021 primarily driven by favorable changes in Accrued liabilities ($6.6 billion), Accounts payable ($4.6 billion) and Inventories ($1.5 billion), partially offset by a decrease in Advances and progress billings ($2.4 billion) in 2022. The increase in Accrued liabilities is primarily driven by the accrued losses on BDS fixed-price development programs, lower payments to 737 MAX customers in 2022, and a $0.7 billion 40Table of Contentspayment in 2021 consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice. Concessions paid to 737 MAX customers totaled $1.0 billion and $2.5 billion during 2022 and 2021. Growth in Accounts Payable in 2022 is a source of cash while reductions in Accounts Payable in 2021 were a use of cash generally reflecting increases in production rates. Inventory improvements were driven by higher 737 MAX deliveries and resumption of 787 deliveries in 2022. Additionally, in 2022 and 2021 we received income tax refunds of $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $0.1 billion in 2022, as compared with $2.5 billion of cash provided in 2021. The $3.4 billion reduction in non-cash items in 2022 is primarily driven by the $3.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 787 program that was recorded in 2021. Net loss for 2022 was $5.1 billion compared with net loss of $4.3 billion in 2021. The $0.8 billion year-over-year increase in the net loss is primarily driven by the absence of an income tax benefit in 2022. The reduction in cash used by operating activities in 2021 compared with 2020 is primarily driven by lower net loss and improved changes in assets and liabilities. Non-cash items in 2021 include the $3.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 787 program which was recorded as a reduction to inventory, as well as $1.2 billion of treasury shares issued to fund Company contributions to the 401(k) plan and $0.8 billion of share-based plans expense reflecting a one-time stock grant to most employees in lieu of 2021 salary increases. The changes in assets and liabilities reflect the significant increase in commercial aircraft inventory in 2020 driven by lower deliveries due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the 737 MAX grounding. In 2021, inventory growth slowed as the continued buildup of 787 aircraft caused by production issues and 777X inventory growth was partially offset by a decrease in 737 MAX inventory following the resumption of deliveries. Compensation payments to 737 MAX customers totaled $2.5 billion in 2021 and $2.2 billion in 2020. In the first quarter of 2021, we paid $0.7 billion consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement between Boeing and the U.S. Department of Justice. Additionally, in 2021, we received income tax refunds of $1.7 billion. Cash provided by Advances and progress billings was $2.5 billion in 2021, as compared with Cash used by Advances and progress billings of $1.1 billion in 2020. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Accounts payable included $2.5 billion and $2.3 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in supply chain financing programs. Payables to suppliers who elected to participate in supply chain financing programs increased by $0.2 billion in 2022 and declined by $1.5 billion and $1.9 billion in 2021 and 2020. Supply chain financing is not material to our overall liquidity. The declines in 2021 and 2020 were primarily due to reductions in commercial purchases from suppliers. Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities during 2022 was $4.4 billion, compared with cash provided by investing activities of $9.3 billion during 2021 and cash used by investing activities of $18.4 billion during 2020. The decrease in cash inflows in 2022 compared to 2021 is primarily due to $5.6 billion of net proceeds from investments compared to $9.8 billion in 2021. The increase in cash inflows in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily due to $27.1 billion of higher net proceeds from investments. Capital expenditures totaled $1.2 billion in 2022, compared with $1.0 billion in 2021 and $1.3 billion in 2020. We expect capital expenditures in 2023 to be higher than in 2022.Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities was $1.3 billion during 2022, compared with $5.6 billion during 2021 and cash provided of $35.0 billion in 2020. The decrease of $4.3 billion compared with 2021 primarily reflects higher net debt repayments in 2021. During 2021, debt repayments net of new borrowings were $5.6 billion, primarily due to $13.8 billion of repayments of our two-year delayed draw term loan credit agreement, partially offset by $9.8 billion of fixed rate senior notes issued in the first quarter of 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, new borrowings net of repayments were $36.3 billion, primarily due to $29.9 billion of fixed rate senior notes issued in 2020 and $13.8 billion of new borrowings under a two-year delayed draw term loan agreement entered into in the first quarter of 2020. 41Table of ContentsAt December 31, 2022 and 2021 debt balances totaled $57.0 billion and $58.1 billion, of which $5.2 billion and $1.3 billion were classified as short-term. This included $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of debt attributable to BCC at December 31, 2022 and 2021, of which $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion were classified as short-term.During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we did not repurchase any shares through our open market share repurchase program. Share repurchases under this program have been suspended since April 2019. In March 2020, the Board of Directors terminated its prior authorization to repurchase shares of the Company's outstanding common stock in the open market. We had 0.2 million, 0.3 million and 0.6 million shares transferred to us from employee tax withholdings in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In March 2020, we announced the suspension of our dividend until further notice. As a result, we did not pay any dividends in 2022 and 2021 compared with $1.2 billion paid in 2020. 42Table of ContentsCapital ResourcesThe following table summarizes certain cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2022, and the estimated timing thereof. See Note 12 for future operating lease payments.(Dollars in millions)CurrentLong-termTotalLong-term debt (including current portion)$5,197 $52,338 $57,535 Interest on debt2,266 31,397 33,663 Pension and other postretirement519 8,133 8,652 Purchase obligations62,025 59,515 121,540 737 MAX customer concessions and consideration(1)100 600 700 (1) For further discussion, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.We expect to be able to fund our cash requirements through cash and short-term investments and cash provided by operations, as well as continued access to capital markets. At December 31, 2022, we had $14.6 billion of cash, $2.6 billion of short-term investments, and $12.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. In the third quarter of 2022, we entered into a $5.8 billion 364-day revolving credit agreement expiring in August 2023, a $3 billion three-year revolving credit agreement expiring in August 2025, and amended our $3.2 billion five-year revolving credit agreement, which expires in October 2024, primarily to incorporate a LIBOR successor rate. The 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date. We anticipate that these credit lines will remain undrawn and primarily serve as back-up liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs. Our increased debt balance resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings in 2020, and our ratings remained unchanged in 2022 and 2021. We expect to be able to access capital markets when we require additional funding in order to pay off existing debt, address further impacts to our business related to market developments, fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. These factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings, and/or associated changes in demand for our products and services. These risks will be particularly acute if we are subject to further credit rating downgrades. The occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and financing or contractual commitments.Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. At December 31, 2022, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements) and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined in the credit agreements). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.43Table of ContentsPension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our pension plans were $5.3 billion and $7.8 billion underfunded as measured under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP). On an ERISA basis our plans are more than 100% funded at December 31, 2022. We do not expect to make significant contributions to our pension plans in 2023. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.In the fourth quarter of 2020, we contributed $3 billion of our common stock to our pension fund. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we also began using our common stock in lieu of cash to fund Company contributions to our 401(k) plans for the foreseeable future. Under this approach, common stock is contributed to our 401(k) plans following each pay period. This further enables the Company to conserve cash. We have retained an independent fiduciary to manage and liquidate stock contributed to these plans at its discretion.Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, customer financing equipment and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts with customers and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology or skills transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our local operations there, placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2022, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding industrial participation agreements 44Table of Contentstotaling $24.8 billion that extend through 2034. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a non-U.S. supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Commercial CommitmentsThe following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2022.(Dollars in millions)Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of LossLess than1 year1-3years4-5yearsAfter 5yearsStandby letters of credit and surety bonds$5,070 $3,859 $1,036 $10 $165 Commercial aircraft financing commitments16,105 3,084 5,989 4,075 2,957 Total commercial commitments$21,175 $6,943 $7,025 $4,085 $3,122 Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns or refinancing with respect to delivered aircraft, based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Customer financing commitments totaled $16.1 billion and $12.9 billion at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The increase relates to new financing commitments. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Contingent ObligationsWe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $752 million at December 31, 2022. For additional information, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.Non-GAAP MeasuresCore Operating Loss, Core Operating Margin and Core Loss Per ShareOur Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP which we supplement with certain non-GAAP financial information. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. We encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. Core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment. The FAS/45Table of ContentsCAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments. Core earnings per share excludes both the FAS/CAS service cost adjustment and non-operating pension and postretirement expenses. Non-operating pension and postretirement expenses represent the components of net periodic benefit costs other than service cost. Pension costs, comprising service and prior service costs computed in accordance with GAAP are allocated to BCA and certain BGS businesses supporting commercial customers. Pension costs allocated to BDS and BGS businesses supporting government customers are computed in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), which employ different actuarial assumptions and accounting conventions than GAAP. CAS costs are allocable to government contracts. Other postretirement benefit costs are allocated to all business segments based on CAS, which is generally based on benefits paid.The Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustments recognized in Loss from operations were benefits of $849 million in 2022, $882 million in 2021 and $1,024 million in 2020. The lower benefits in 2022 and 2021 were primarily due to reductions in allocated pension cost year over year. The non-operating pension expense included in Other income, net was a benefit of $881 million in 2022, $528 million in 2021 and $340 million in 2020. The higher benefits in 2022 were primarily due to lower amortization of net actuarial losses and a settlement loss that was recorded in 2021. For further discussion of pension and other postretirement costs, see the Management’s Discussion and Analysis on page 24 of this Form 10-K and see Note 22 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. Management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to U.S. government contracts.46Table of ContentsReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures to GAAP MeasuresThe table below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures of core operating loss, core operating margins and core loss per share with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures of loss from operations, operating margins and diluted loss per share.(Dollars in millions, except per share data)Years ended December 31, 202220212020Revenues$66,608 $62,286 $58,158 Loss from operations, as reported($3,547)($2,902)($12,767)Operating margins(5.3)%(4.7)%(22.0)%Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)($849)($882)($1,024)Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)(294)(291)(359)FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)($1,143)($1,173)($1,383)Core operating loss (non-GAAP)($4,690)($4,075)($14,150)Core operating margins (non-GAAP)(7.0)%(6.5)%(24.3)%Diluted loss per share, as reported($8.30)($7.15)($20.88)Pension FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)(1.43)(1.50)(1.80)Postretirement FAS/CAS service cost adjustment(1)(0.49)(0.49)(0.63)Non-operating pension expense(2)(1.47)(0.91)(0.60)Non-operating postretirement expense(2)(0.10) 0.03 Provision for deferred income taxes on adjustments (3)0.73 0.61 0.63 Core loss per share (non-GAAP)($11.06)($9.44)($23.25)Weighted average diluted shares (in millions)595.2 588.0 569.0 (1)FAS/CAS service cost adjustment represents the difference between the FAS pension and postretirement service costs calculated under GAAP and costs allocated to the business segments.

Our long-term contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.Accounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and lingering impacts of COVID-19.Revenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the performance obligation’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. Net cumulative catch-up adjustments for changes in estimated revenues and costs at completion across all long-term contracts, including the impact of increases in estimated losses on unexercised options, increased Loss from operations by $5,253 million, $880 million and $942 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The cumulative catch-up adjustments in 2022 were primarily due to losses recognized on the VC-25B, KC-46A Tanker, MQ-25, Commercial Crew and T-7A Red Hawk programs. These are all fixed-price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different earnings could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, internal and supplier performance, inflationary trends, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1% during 2022, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $300 million.Program AccountingProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate revenues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for 48Table of Contentsdelivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates.Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, learning curve, change incorporation, regulatory requirements in connection with certification, flight test and certification schedules, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, inflationary or deflationary trends, and lingering impacts of COVID-19.To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. This includes reassessing the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program, a loss is recorded in the current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.The 767, 777X, and 787 programs had near break-even or single digit margins at December 31, 2022. Adverse changes to the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in earnings charges in future periods.777X Program The 777X program had near break-even gross margins at December 31, 2022. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods, which may be material.787 Program During the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the 787 program primarily due to rework driving longer delivery delays than were previously expected and associated customer considerations. During the fourth quarter of 2022, we increased the 787 program accounting quantity by 100 units due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. The increase in the accounting quantity improved the program’s profit margin.Our program revenue and cost assumptions reflect our current best estimate. However, if we are required to reduce the accounting quantity and/or production rates, experience further delivery delays, incur additional customer considerations, or experience other factors that result in lower margins, the 787 program could record additional losses in future periods, which may be material.49Table of ContentsPension PlansMany of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. The majority of employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans have transitioned to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and Shareholders’ equity.The projected benefit obligation is sensitive to discount rates. The projected benefit obligation would decrease by $1,270 million or increase by $1,415 million if the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would not have a significant impact on pension cost. However, net periodic pension cost is sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2022 net periodic pension cost by $158 million. See Note 16 of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, which includes the discount rate and expected long-term rate of asset return assumptions for the last three years.Deferred Income Taxes – Valuation AllowanceThe Company had deferred income tax assets of $12,301 million at December 31, 2022 that can be used in future years to offset taxable income and reduce income taxes payable. The Company had deferred income tax liabilities of $9,306 million at December 31, 2022 that will partially offset deferred income tax assets and result in higher taxable income in future years and increase income taxes payable. Tax law determines whether future reversals of temporary differences will result in taxable and deductible amounts that offset each other in future years. The particular years in which temporary differences result in taxable or deductible amounts generally are determined by the timing of the recovery of the related asset or settlement of the related liability.On a quarterly basis, we assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets against future sources of taxable income and reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by recording a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that all or a portion of such assets will not be realized.This assessment takes into account both positive and negative evidence. A recent history of financial reporting losses is heavily weighted as a source of objectively verifiable negative evidence. Due to our recent history of losses, we determined we could not include future projected earnings in our analysis. Rather, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. The selection of methodologies and assessment of when temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts involves significant management judgment and is inherently complex and subjective. We believe that the methodologies we use are reasonable and can be replicated on a consistent basis in future periods.Deferred tax liabilities represent the assumed source of future taxable income and the majority are assumed to generate taxable amounts during the next five years. Deferred tax assets include amounts related to pension and other postretirement benefits that are assumed to generate significant deductible amounts beyond five years. The Company’s valuation allowance of $3,162 million at December 31, 2022 primarily relates to pension and other postretirement benefit obligation deferred tax assets, tax credits and other carryforwards that are assumed to reverse beyond the period in which reversals of deferred tax liabilities are assumed to occur. During 2022, the Company increased the valuation allowance by $739 million primarily due to tax credits and other carryforwards generated in 2022 that 50Table of Contentscannot be realized in 2022, partially offset by favorable pension remeasurement. Until the Company generates sustained levels of profitability, additional valuation allowances may have to be recorded with corresponding adverse impacts on earnings and/or other comprehensive income.For additional information regarding income taxes, see Note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskInterest Rate RiskWe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed- and floating-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. As of December 31, 2022, we do not have any significant floating-rate debt obligations. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes.Foreign Currency Exchange Rate RiskWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2022, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $232 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.Commodity Price RiskWe are subject to commodity price risk relating to commodity purchase contracts for items used in production that are subject to changes in the market price. We use commodity swaps and commodity purchase contracts to hedge against these potentially unfavorable price changes. Our commodity purchase contracts and derivatives are both sensitive to changes in the market price. At December 31, 2022, a 10% increase or decrease in the market price in our commodity derivatives would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $70 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of market price fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these commodity purchase contracts and the offsetting swaps do not create material market risk.51Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:04.138728
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2004,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations RISK FACTORS We generally make sales under purchase orders that are subject to cancellation, modification or rescheduling without significant penalties to our customers. Changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of the airline industry could result in customer requests for rescheduling or cancellation of contractual orders. Since a significant portion of our backlog is related to orders from commercial airlines, further adverse developments in the commercial airline industry could cause customers to reschedule or terminate their contracts with us. We are dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices. We are also highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies. We are dependent upon the ability of our large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards, and delivery schedules at anticipated costs, and their failure to do so would adversely affect production schedules and contract profitability, while jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties. We depend on a limited number of customers, including the U.S. Government and major commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will purchase additional products or services from us after our contract with the customer has ended. The loss of the U.S. Government or any of the major commercial airlines as customers could significantly reduce our revenues and our opportunity to generate a profit. Several of the commercial airlines, including United Airlines and Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. have filed for bankruptcy protection. Sales outside the U.S. (principally export sales from domestic operations) by geographic area are included on page 107. Approximately 2% of total sales were derived from non-U.S. operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 and 1% for each year ended December 31, 2001 and 2002. Approximately 41% of our contractual backlog at December 31, 2003, was with non-U.S. customers. Sales outside the United States are influenced by U.S. Government foreign policy, international relationships, and trade policies of governments worldwide. Relative profitability is not significantly different from that experienced in the domestic market. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION We operate in six principal segments: Commercial Airplanes; Aircraft and Weapon Systems (A&WS), Network Systems, Support Systems, and Launch and Orbital Systems (L&OS) collectively Integrated Defense Systems (IDS); and Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). All other activities fall within the Other segment, principally made up of Boeing Technology, Connexion by BoeingSM and Air Traffic Management. Our Commercial Airplanes operations principally involve development, production and marketing of commercial jet aircraft and providing related support services, principally to the commercial airline industry worldwide. IDS operations principally involve research, development, production, modification and support of the following products and related systems: military aircraft, helicopters and missiles, space systems, 13 Table of Contents missile defense systems, satellites and satellite launching vehicles, rocket engines, and information and battle management systems. Although some IDS products are contracted in the commercial environment, the primary customer is the U.S. Government. BCC is primarily engaged in the financing of commercial and private aircraft and commercial equipment. However, on November 12, 2003, we announced that we will refocus BCC’s strategic direction to concentrate on supporting the operations of our business units. On January 15, 2004, we also announced additional steps, consistent with our new strategy, including the evaluation of strategic alternatives related to BCC’s commercial equipment finance group. Boeing Technology is an advanced research and development organization focused on innovative technologies, improved processes and the creation of new products. Connexion by BoeingSM provides two-way broadband data communications service for global travelers. Air Traffic Management develops new approaches to a global solution to address air traffic management issues. Financing activities other than those carried out by BCC are also included within the Other segment classification. Consolidated Results of Operations (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 50,485 $ 54,061 $ 58,198 Operating Earnings $ 449 $ 3,462 $ 3,586 Operating Margins 0.9 % 6.4 % 6.2 % Net Earnings $ 718 $ 492 $ 2,827 Research and Development $ 1,651 $ 1,639 $ 1,936 Effective Income Tax Rate (30.5 )% 27.1 % 20.7 % Contractual Backlog $ 104,812 $ 104,173 $ 106,591 Revenues Lower revenues in 2003 are primarily due to reduced deliveries of our commercial airplanes. The reduced deliveries are the result of the airline industry’s reduced need for additional new aircraft. However, the overall decrease in commercial airplane revenues is partially offset by increased revenues driven by increased deliveries of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM); increased volume in homeland security, spares and maintenance, and proprietary programs; and the start up of Future Combat Systems. The lower revenues in 2002 compared to 2001 principally reflect decreased deliveries in the Commercial Airplanes segment, offset by growth in the IDS segment revenues. Based on current schedules and plans, we project total 2004 revenues to be approximately $52 billion. Operating Earnings Lower operating earnings in 2003 reflect lower planned commercial airplane deliveries, charges related to the decision to end production of the 757 program, goodwill impairment charges, charges related to the satellite and launch businesses, lower pension income, and an increase in other expenses, as described below. We delivered 100 fewer commercial airplanes in 2003 compared to 2002, and recognized a $184 million charge associated with the decision to end production of the 757 program. We also recognized $913 million in goodwill charges as a result of a goodwill impairment analysis triggered by the reorganization of our Military Aircraft and Missile Systems and Space and Communications segments into IDS; $572 million recorded at IDS and $341 million recorded at the Commercial Airplanes segment. 2003 operating earnings were negatively impacted by a $1.1 billion charge related to the satellite and launch businesses. We experienced lower pension income due to declining interest rates and negative pension asset returns in 2001 and 2002, the impact of which is amortized into earnings in future periods. We also incurred a charge due to higher estimated cleanup 14 Table of Contents costs, increased workers’ compensation claims, and increased legal expense. These factors were partially offset by continued growth and strong operating performance in our portfolio of defense businesses and by continued improvements in operating efficiencies at Commercial Airplanes. 2001 operating earnings were significantly impacted by $935 million of pre-tax special charges related to the events of September 11, 2001. (See Note 3.) Excluding the September 11 special charges of $935 million, operating earnings in 2002 were $1,059 million lower than 2001 operating earnings. This decrease in operating earnings reflected lower commercial airplane deliveries partially offset by production efficiencies in the Commercial Airplanes segment and higher deliveries of IDS products. IDS operating earnings also decreased as commercial satellite losses offset growth and performance on other programs. In addition, $426 million of asset impairment charges and additional valuation reserves related to customer and commercial financing assets were recorded by BCC and the Other segment during 2002. We generated net periodic benefit income related to pensions of $67 million in 2003, $404 million in 2002 and $920 million in 2001. Not all net periodic pension benefit income or expense is recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and a portion remains in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Accordingly, the operating earnings for 2003, 2002, and 2001, included $147 million, $526 million and $802 million, respectively, of pension income. Although our pension plan investment returns were 17 percent for the plan year ended September 30, 2003, interest rates continued to decline. Accordingly, we expect our pension investment returns over the long term to decrease, as reflected in our 25 basis point reduction of the expected long-term asset return rate (from 9.00 percent in 2003 to 8.75 percent in 2004). This is expected to reduce pension income reflected in operating earnings from $147 million in 2003 to pension expense in the range of $350 million to $400 million in 2004. In 2005, the pension impact to earnings will depend on market conditions and discretionary funding, but based upon current assumptions, we expect to recognize non-cash pension expense estimated to range from $600 million to $700 million. Net Earnings Other income in 2003 increased over 2002 primarily due to the receipt of $397 million of interest income associated with a $1.1 billion partial settlement of federal income tax audits relating to tax years 1992 through 1997. Interest and debt expense increased due to the debt issuances and repayments in 2003. The increase in 2003 net earnings over 2002 reflects the federal tax settlement mentioned above, partially offset by lower operating earnings. Other income in 2001 included $210 million of interest income associated with federal income tax audit settlements; 2002 did not include similar interest income. Also contributing to lower other income in 2002 was $46 million of losses on long-held equity investments. Interest and debt expense increased from 2001 to 2002 due to higher levels of debt, primarily associated with the increased customer and commercial financing activities of BCC. Net earnings in 2002 reflected a $1,827 million charge related to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142. Research and Development Research and development expenditures involve design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative commercial jet aircraft, advance space, other company-sponsored product development, and basic research and development. These expenditures are either charged directly against earnings or are included in amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. Government contracts. In addition, Boeing Technology, our advanced research and 15 Table of Contents development organization, focuses on improving our competitive position by investing in certain technologies and processes that apply to multiple business units. Technology investments currently being pursued within Boeing Technology include network-centric operations, affordable structures and manufacturing technology, lean and efficient design processes and tools, lean support and service initiatives, advanced platform systems and safe and clean products. Research and development expense increased in 2003, principally reflecting IDS’s continued focus on the 767 Tanker program development as well as the development of communication system architectures in order to support various business opportunities including Future Combat Systems, Joint Tactical Radio System, FAB-T and Global Missile. In 2003, research and development expenses decreased at Commercial Airplanes due to reduced spending on the development of the 747-400ER. Commercial Airplanes’ research and development expenses are expected to increase in 2004 due to spending on the 7E7 program. Research and development highlights for each of the major business segments are discussed in more detail in Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition. Income Taxes The 2003 effective income tax rate of (30.5)% varies from the federal statutory tax rate of 35%, principally due to tax benefits from federal tax refunds, Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) and Extraterritorial Income (ETI) Exclusion tax benefits of $115 million, partially offset by tax charges related to the non-deductibility for tax purposes of significant portions of goodwill impairment charges. This rate also reflects tax credits, state income taxes, charitable donations and tax-deductible dividends. The effective income tax rates of 27.1% for 2002 and 20.7% for 2001 also vary from the federal statutory tax rate principally due to FSC and ETI benefits of $195 million in 2002 and $222 million in 2001. The 2001 income tax rate also reflects a one-time benefit reflecting a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) relating to research credit claims on McDonnell Douglas Corporation fixed price government contracts applicable to the 1986-1992 federal income tax returns. Beginning in 1999 and continuing through 2002 the European Union (EU) issued a series of objections with the World Trade Organization (WTO) to both U.S. FSC and ETI provisions. The WTO agreed with the EU and ruled that the FSC and ETI provisions constitute prohibited export subsidies. In response the WTO authorized the EU to impose retaliatory tariffs. A list issued by the EU, of products upon which the retaliatory tariff would be imposed, does not include our products. President Bush has stated that the U.S. will bring its tax laws into compliance with the WTO ruling. Both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee are continuing to assess alternatives for a replacement of the ETI legislation. It is not possible to predict what impact this issue will have on future earnings pending final resolution of these matters. If ETI is repealed and replacement legislation is not enacted, our loss of the benefit could be substantial. Income taxes have been settled with the IRS for all years through 1981, and IRS examinations have been completed through 1997. During 2003 a partial settlement was reached with the IRS for the years 16 Table of Contents 1992-1997 and we received a $1.1 billion refund (of which $397 million represents interest). Also, in January and February 2004, we received federal tax refunds and a notice of approved refunds totaling $145 million (of which, $40 million represents interest). The refunds related to a settlement of the 1996 tax year and the 1997 partial tax year for McDonnell Douglas Corporation, which we merged with on August 1, 1997. The notice of approved refunds related to the 1985 tax year. These events resulted in a $727 million increase in net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2003. We believe adequate provisions for all outstanding issues have been made for all open years. Backlog Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and foreign government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog from 2002 to 2003 related to increases in contractual backlog for A&WS and Network Systems, offset by decreases for Commercial Airplanes. A&WS obtained orders for the Apache helicopters from Greece and Kuwait, the F/A-18 E/F Multi Year II contract and the initial funding for the EA-18G from the U.S. Navy while Network Systems obtained orders for the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense program and Turkey 737 AEW&C programs coupled with the initial funding of the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program. Commercial Airplanes’ decrease in contractual backlog reflects the impact that the economic downturn has had on the airline industry. The decrease in contractual backlog from 2001 to 2002 related to higher delivery volumes on all airplane programs relative to new orders. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and foreign government definitive contracts for which funding has not been appropriated. The FCS and F/A-18 programs were the primary contributors for the increase in unobligated backlog in 2003. For segment reporting purposes, we report Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog for airplanes built and sold to other segments. Commercial Airplanes relieves contractual backlog upon the sale of these airplanes to other segments. IDS contractual backlog includes the modification performed on intracompany airplane purchases from Commercial Airplanes. IDS relieves contractual backlog for the modification performed on airplanes received from Commercial Airplanes upon delivery to the customer or at the attainment of performance milestones. Liquidity and Capital Resources Primary sources of our liquidity and capital resources include cash flow from operations and substantial borrowing capacity through commercial paper programs and long-term capital markets, as well as unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements. The primary factors that affect our investment requirements and liquidity position, other than operating results associated with current sales activity, include the following: timing of new and derivative programs requiring both high developmental expenditures and initial inventory buildup; growth and contractions in business cycles, including growth and expansion requirements and requirements associated with reducing sales levels; customer financing assistance; the timing of federal income tax payments/refunds as well as interest and dividend payments; our stock repurchase plan; internal investments; and potential acquisitions and divestitures. 17 Table of Contents Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net earnings $ 718 $ 492 $ 2,827 Non-cash items 3,135 4,355 1,786 Changes in working capital 28 (611 ) (878 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 3,881 4,236 3,735 Net cash used by investing activities (1,060 ) (3,282 ) (4,630 ) Net cash provided (used) by financing activities (521 ) 746 518 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 2,300 1,700 (377 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 2,333 633 1,010 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 4,633 $ 2,333 $ 633 Non-cash items Non-cash items in earnings primarily include depreciation, amortization, share-based plans expense, impairments, valuation provisions, and pension income. Non-cash items and corresponding amounts are listed in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Working capital During 2003, our investment in working capital decreased, principally due to the following items: · a decrease in inventory related to the following: · the downturn of the commercial aviation market, which has resulted in less demand for the production of commercial airplanes, · a build-up of inventory related to international and space programs, offset by an increase in IDS billings, · an increase in advances in excess of related costs at IDS for military aircraft contracts, partially offset by reduced advance payments at Commercial Airplanes due to reduced orders as a result of the depressed commercial aviation market, and · an increase to our investment in working capital due to $1.7 billion of discretionary pension contributions (see discussion below regarding pensions), offset by · a decrease in income taxes payable related to tax payments made, receipt of cash for partial tax settlement, and a tax expense from current earnings. Net cash provided by operations includes intracompany cash of $1.7 billion, $2.7 billion and $3.0 billion for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, resulting from the sale of aircraft by the Commercial Airplanes segment for customers who received financing from BCC. An offsetting use of cash was reported as an investing activity. Pensions 2003 operating cash flow included $1.7 billion of cash funding to the pension plans. Almost all of the contributions were voluntary to improve the funded status of our plans. We expect pension funding requirements to be approximately $100 million in 2004. However, we are evaluating a discretionary contribution to our plans in the range of $1.0 billion (pre-tax) during the first quarter of 2004, and will consider making additional contributions later in the year. We measure our pension plan using a September 30 year-end for financial accounting purposes. Although in 2003, actual investment returns were well in excess of the expected rate of 9.0%, we reduced our expected rate of return on plan assets by 25 basis points to 8.75% beginning in 2004 18 Table of Contents which reflects expected performance over the long-term. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on long-term target asset allocations of 56% equity, 28% fixed income, 7% real estate, and 9% other. Current allocations are within 1 to 10% of each of the long-term targets. Historically low interest rates (a key factor when estimating plan liabilities), caused us to recognize a $358 million increase to the accrued pension plan liability and a $226 million after-tax decrease to the accumulated other comprehensive income account within shareholders’ equity in the fourth quarter of 2003. This non-cash charge did not impact earnings or cash flow, and could reverse in future periods if interest rates increase or market performance and plan returns increase. We use a discount rate that is based on a point-in-time estimate as of each annual September 30 measurement date. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points, pension liabilities in total would have decreased $1.2 billion or increased $1.3 billion, respectively. Investing activities The majority of BCC’s customer financing is funded by debt and cash flow from its own operation. As of December 31, 2003, we had outstanding irrevocable commitments of approximately $1.5 billion to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order or under option for deliveries scheduled through the year 2007. Not all of these commitments are likely to be used; however, a significant portion of these commitments are with parties with relatively low credit ratings. (See Notes 19 and 20.) In 2003, there was a significant decrease in cash used for investing activities compared to 2002. In 2002, BCC made investments of $408 million in Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs), while no such investments were made in 2003 or 2001. EETCs are investment trusts widely used in the airline industry as a method of financing aircraft. In 2003, we received $360 million in cash related to the settlement of purchase price contingencies associated with our acquisition of Hughes’ satellite manufacturing operations. Additions to Property, Plant, and Equipment in 2003 were approximately $250 million less than 2002. The BCC portfolio continued to grow in 2003 but compared to 2002 additions to customer financing and properties on lease were approximately $650 million less. The change related to customer financing reductions is mainly due to the receipt of customer payments. Financing activities Debt maturities, which include BCC amounts, were $1.8 billion in 2003, $1.3 billion in 2002, and $0.5 billion in 2001. We issued approximately $1.0 billion of debt in 2003 to refinance corporate debt that matured in 2002 and 2003. Additionally, BCC issued $1.0 billion of debt in 2003, $2.8 billion in 2002 and $3.9 billion in 2001. In 2003 and 2002, BCC debt issuance was generally used for growth in the customer financing portfolio. BCC’s debt issuance in 2001 was performed in conjunction with the transfer of a significant portion of our customer financing assets to BCC, as well as growth in BCC’s customer financing portfolio. Additionally, we have a share repurchase program, but there were no share repurchases in 2003 or 2002. In 2001, we repurchased 40,734,500 shares. (See Note 17.) Credit Ratings Our credit ratings are summarized below: Fitch Moody’s Standard& Poor’s Long-term: Boeing A+ A3 A BCC A+ A3 A Short-term: Boeing F-1 P-2 A-1 BCC F-1 P-2 A-1 19 Table of Contents On December 17, 2003, Moody’s resolved the negative watch they had on us and BCC. Moody’s downgraded our long-term rating from A2 to A3 and our short-term rating from P-1 to P-2. Moody’s confirmed BCC’s ratings, largely because we put a support agreement in place in which we commit to maintain certain financial metrics at BCC. All of Moody’s ratings for Boeing and BCC now have a stable outlook. Capital Resources Boeing and BCC each have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. As of December 31, 2003, neither Boeing nor BCC had any outstanding commercial paper issuances. We have consolidated debt obligations of $14.4 billion, which are unsecured. Approximately $1.1 billion will mature in 2004, and the balance has a weighted average maturity of approximately 13 years. Excluding non-recourse debt of $0.5 billion and BCC debt of $9.2 billion total debt represents 43% of total shareholders’ equity plus debt. Our consolidated debt, including BCC, represents 64% of total shareholders’ equity plus debt. We have substantial borrowing capacity. Currently, $3.4 billion remains available to BCC from shelf registrations filed with the SEC and $4.0 billion ($2.0 billion exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements with a group of major banks. (See Note 14.) We believe our internally generated liquidity, together with access to external capital resources, will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans, and also provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2003, as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied. Contractual obligations (Dollars in millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 - 3years 4 - 5years After 5years Long-term debt $ 14,044 $ 1,056 $ 3,431 $ 2,047 $ 7,510 Capital lease obligations 399 88 141 83 87 Operating lease obligations 1,743 273 434 323 713 Purchase obligations: Not recorded on statement of financial position Production related 43,071 19,382 15,886 5,626 2,177 Pension and other post retirement cash requirements 3,539 626 1,636 1,277 Recorded on statement of financial position 5,695 4,246 367 343 739 Total contractual obligations $ 68,491 $ 25,671 $ 21,895 $ 9,699 $ 11,226 Purchase obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, the agreements are not cancelable without a substantial penalty. Long-term debt, capital leases, and operating leases are 20 Table of Contents shown in the above table regardless of whether they meet the characteristics of purchase obligations. Purchase obligations include both amounts that are and are not recorded on the statements of financial position. Approximately 20% of the purchase obligation amounts disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase obligations – not recorded on the statement of financial position Pension and other postretirement benefits Pension funding is an estimate of our minimum funding requirements through 2005 to provide pension benefits for employees based on service provided through 2003 pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Obligations relating to other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments, since the majority of our other postretirement benefits are not funded through a trust, and the estimated contribution to the one plan that is funded through a trust through 2008. Our estimate may change significantly depending on the actual rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, discretionary pension contributions, regulatory rules, and medical trends. Production related Production related purchase obligations include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises due to the extended production planning horizon for many of our products, including commercial aircraft, military aircraft and other products where delivery to the customer occurs over an extended period of time. A significant portion of these inventory commitments are either supported by firm contracts from customers, or have historically resulted in settlement through either termination payments or contract adjustments should the customer base not materialize to support delivery from the supplier. Industrial participation agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers in foreign countries to effect economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies, as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work, placement of vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology, or other forms of assistance to the foreign country. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our foreign customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2003, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2003, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $8.6 billion that extend through 2015. In cases where we satisfy our commitments through the purchase of supplies and the criteria described in “purchase obligations” is met, amounts are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, the foreign country or customer must have sufficient capability and capacity and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Purchase obligations recorded on the statement of financial position Purchase obligations recorded on the statement of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation, supplier penalties, accrued property taxes, and dividends payable. 21 Table of Contents Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees and variable interests in unconsolidated entities. Guarantees The following tables provide quantitative data regarding our third-party guarantees. The maximum potential payment amounts represent “worst-case scenarios” and do not necessarily reflect our expected results. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet reflects our best estimate of future payments we may incur as part of fulfilling our guarantee obligations. As of December 31, 2003 Maximum Potential Payments Estimated Proceeds from Collateral/Recourse CarryingAmount ofLiabilities* Contingent repurchase commitments $ 5,564 $ 5,564 Trade-in commitments 1,279 1,214 $ 65 Asset-related guarantees 468 364 5 Credit guarantees related to the Sea Launch venture 519 311 208 Other credit guarantees 106 50 5 Equipment trust certificates 28 Performance guarantees 56 18 As of December 31, 2002 MaximumPotentialPayments EstimatedProceeds from Collateral/ Recourse Carrying Amount of Liabilities* Contingent repurchase commitments $ 4,801 $ 4,801 Trade-in commitments 2,452 2,296 $ 156 Asset-related guarantees 486 378 17 Credit guarantees related to the Sea Launch venture 535 186 200 Other credit guarantees 245 72 19 Equipment trust certificates 182 101 Performance guarantees 57 1 * Amounts included in accounts payable and other liabilities In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into specified-price trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft for the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have issued contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price at a future point in time, generally ten years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft, if the customer wishes to sell it to us at that time. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If, in the future, we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Contingent repurchase commitments and trade-in commitments are now included in our guarantees discussion based on our current analysis of the underlying transactions. Based on our historical experience, we believe that very few, if any, of our outstanding contingent repurchase commitments will ultimately become trade-in commitments. During 2003, we recorded no expense and made no net cash payments related to our contingent repurchase commitments. 22 Table of Contents Exposure related to the trade-in of used aircraft resulting from trade-in commitments may take the form of: (1) adjustments to revenue related to the sale of new aircraft determined at the signing of a definitive agreement, and/or (2) charges to cost of products and services related to adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for new aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. The trade-in aircraft exposure included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the tables above is related to item (2) above. There is a high degree of uncertainty inherent in the assessment of the likelihood of trade-in commitments. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources and is continually assessed by management. During 2003, we recorded expense of $11 million and made net cash payments totaling $746 million related to our trade-in commitments. We have issued various asset-related guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale of certain commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event the related aircraft fair values fall below a specified amount at a future point in time. No aircraft have been delivered with these types of guarantees in several years. Recent declines in asset values of commercial aircraft increase the risk of future payment by us under these guarantees. During 2003, we recorded expense of $15 million and made no net cash payments related to our asset-related guarantees. We have previously issued credit guarantees to creditors of the Sea Launch venture, of which we are a 40% partner, to assist the venture in obtaining financing. In the event we are required to perform on these guarantees, we have the right to recover a portion of the loss from other venture partners and have collateral rights to certain assets of the venture. In addition, we have issued other credit guarantees to facilitate the sale of certain commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original debtor or lessee. Our commercial aircraft credit-related guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft. A substantial portion of these guarantees have been extended on behalf of original debtors or lessees with less than investment-grade credit. Recent financial weakness in certain airlines further exposes us to loss under our credit guarantees. During 2003, we recorded expense of $2 million and made net cash payments totaling $13 million related to our credit guarantees. As a liquidity provider for equipment trust certificate (ETC) pass-through arrangements, we have certain obligations to investors in the trusts, which require funding to the trust to cover interest due to such investors resulting from an event of default by United Airlines. In the event of funding, we would receive a first priority position in the ETC collateral in the amount of the funding. On February 7, 2003, we advanced $101 million to the trust perfecting our collateral position and terminating our liquidity obligation. The trust currently has collateral value that significantly exceeds the amount due to us. Also relating to an ETC investment, we have potential obligations relating to shortfall interest payments in the event that the interest rates in the underlying agreements are reset below a certain level. These obligations would cease if United Airlines were to default on our interest payments to the trust. There were no significant payments made by us during 2003. We have outstanding performance guarantees issued in conjunction with joint venture investments. Pursuant to these guarantees, we would be required to make payments in the event a third-party fails to perform specified services. We have made no significant payments in relation to these performance guarantees. 23 Table of Contents Material variable interests in unconsolidated entities In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which clarified the application of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (ARB 51), Consolidated Financial Statements, relating to consolidation of variable interest entities (VIEs). FIN 46 requires identification of our participation in VIEs, which are defined as entities with a level of invested equity insufficient to fund future activities to operate on a stand-alone basis, or whose equity holders lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. For entities identified as VIEs, FIN 46 sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party, if any, bears a majority of the exposure to the expected losses, or stands to gain from a majority of the expected returns. FIN 46 also sets forth certain disclosures regarding interests in VIEs that are deemed significant, even if consolidation is not required. In December 2003, the FASB revised and re-released FIN 46 as “FIN 46(R).” The provisions of FIN 46(R) are effective beginning in first quarter 2004, however we elected to adopt FIN 46(R) as of December 31, 2003. One of the significant modifications made by the revised interpretation includes a scope exception for certain entities that are deemed to be “businesses” and meet certain other criteria. Entities that meet this scope exception are not subject to the accounting and disclosure rules of FIN 46(R), but are subject to the pre-existing consolidation rules under ARB 51, which are based on an analysis of voting rights. This scope exception applies to certain operating joint ventures that we previously disclosed as VIEs, such as the Sea Launch venture and other military aircraft-related ventures. Under the applicable ARB 51 rules, we are not required to consolidate these ventures. Our investments in ETCs and EETCs continue to be included in the scope of FIN 46(R), but do not require consolidation. However, we will continue to make certain disclosures about these entities, as required by FIN 46(R). We have investments in ETCs and EETCs, which are trusts that passively hold debt investments for a large number of aircraft to enhance liquidity for investors, who in turn pass this liquidity benefit directly to airlines in the form of lower coupon and/or greater debt capacity. ETCs and EETCs provide investors with tranched rights to cash flows from a financial instrument, as well as a collateral position in the related asset. As of December 31, 2003, our investment balance in ETCs and EETCs was $433 million. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded revenues of $39 million and cash flows of $94 million. We are a subordinated lender to certain SPEs that are utilized by the airlines, lenders, and loan guarantors, including, for example, the Export-Import Bank of the United States. All of these SPEs are included in the scope of FIN46(R), however only certain SPEs require consolidation. SPE arrangements are utilized to isolate individual transactions for legal liability or tax purposes, or to perfect security interests from our perspective, as well as, in some cases, that of a third-party lender in certain leveraged lease transactions. As of December 31, 2003, our investment balance in non-consolidated SPE arrangements that are VIEs was $201 million. During the year ended December 31, 2003, we recorded revenues of $17 million and cash flows of $62 million. Commercial commitments The following tables summarize our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2003, as well as an estimate of the timing in which these commitments are expected to expire.

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Commercial aviation has been impacted by an economic downturn that began in 2001 and continued through 2003. In addition, the industry suffered a tremendous shock from the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Air travel worldwide has not fully recovered to the volume carried by the airlines in 2000, which has negatively affected profitability for many airlines. Late in 2002 traffic began to recover, and holiday travel indicated that the industry recovery was underway. However, the Iraq War and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in early 2003 caused the industry to again retract and delayed recovery. Overall, the industry produced another year of losses led by full service airlines in the U.S. In contrast, low-cost carriers in the U.S. and in Europe are reporting positive financial results and continue to grow operations. European network airlines are expected to show better results than their U.S. counterparts for their fiscal year end. Likewise, Asian airlines are expected to fare better overall than their U.S. counterparts because traffic to and from Asia has nearly rebounded to pre-SARS levels. Our estimated timetable for industry recovery has been delayed. We presently expect the recovery in air traffic that started in 2003 to result in renewed demand for capacity in 2004. Overall, airlines are expected to generate another year of losses in 2003 before producing a small profit in aggregate for 2004. The projection of sustained profitability in 2004 is expected to lead to an order recovery in 2005, with delivery growth expected to begin in 2006. The major uncertainty facing the industry is the impact of any additional unforeseen exogenous shocks similar to the 2003 SARS outbreak and the Iraq War. The industry could also face unexpected consequences of events that have already occurred, such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Our 20-year forecast of the average long-term growth rate in passenger traffic is 5.1% annually, based on projected average worldwide annual economic real growth of 3.2%. Based on global economic growth projections over the long term, and taking into consideration an increasingly competitive environment, increasing utilization levels of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $1.9 trillion market for new airplanes over the next 20 years. This is a long-term forecast; historically, while factors such as the Gulf War and increased ticket charges for security have had significant impact over the span of several years, they have not dramatically affected the longer-term trends in the world economy, and therefore, our market outlook. Inherent Business Risks Commercial jet aircraft are normally sold on a firm fixed-price basis with an indexed price escalation clause. Our ability to deliver jet aircraft on schedule is dependent upon a variety of factors, including execution of internal performance plans, availability of raw materials, performance of suppliers and subcontractors, and regulatory certification. The introduction of new commercial aircraft programs and major derivatives involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. The worldwide market for commercial jet aircraft is predominately driven by long-term trends in airline passenger traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic 25 Table of Contents growth, both in developed and emerging countries, and political stability. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes, and price and other competitive factors. Industry competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long-term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. The market liberalization in Europe has continued to enable low-cost airlines to rapidly gain market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares, making it similar to the competitive environment in the U.S. This results in both near-term and continued price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately half of Commercial Airplanes’ third-party sales and contractual backlog are from customers based outside the U.S. We face aggressive international competitors that are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. They plan to deliver the first A380, with more capacity than a 747, in early 2006. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. The recent decline of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies is putting unusual pressure on their future revenues and profits. While this may seem like an advantage to us, it contains a potential threat in that competitors may react by aggressively reducing costs, potentially improving their longer-term competitive posture. Airbus has indicated that they are adopting this approach, and plan more than 10% reduction in costs by 2006. If the dollar strengthens by then, Airbus could use the extra efficiency to gain market share and develop new products. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network for airlines throughout the world to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. (See Fleet Support discussion on page 31.) As an example, we have made on-line access available to all airline customers for engineering drawings, parts lists, service bulletins and maintenance manuals. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to maintain leadership at satisfactory margins. While we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction activities, events may occur that will prevent us from achieving planned results. Summary Recent signs of recovery and the continued expectation for long-term growth in air travel are encouraging. For example, December 2003 air traffic levels matched the air traffic levels of December 2000. This is the first time passenger demand returned to pre-September 11 levels. This is somewhat offset by the increasing levels of competition in both airlines and airplane manufacturing. Overall, the commercial airplane market has great potential. We are well positioned in the 100-seat and above 26 Table of Contents commercial jet airplane market, and intend to remain the airline industry’s preferred supplier through emphasis on product offerings and customer service that provide the best overall value in the industry. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 22,408 $ 28,387 $ 35,056 % of Total Company Revenues 44 % 52 % 60 % Operating Earnings $ 707 $ 2,017 $ 1,911 Operating Margins 3.2 % 7.1 % 5.5 % Research and Development $ 676 $ 768 $ 858 Contractual Backlog $ 63,929 $ 68,159 $ 75,850 Revenues Commercial Airplanes revenue is derived primarily from commercial jet aircraft deliveries. The decline in revenue in 2003 compared to 2002 and 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to the decline in the commercial aviation market, as discussed above in the “Business Environment and Trends” section, resulting in fewer commercial jet aircraft deliveries. Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31, including deliveries under operating lease, which are identified by parentheses, were as follows: Model 2003 2002 2001 717 12 (11) 20 49 (10) 737 Next-Generation* 173 223 (2) 299 (5) 747 19 (1) 27 (1) 31 (1) 757 14 29 45 767** 24 (5) 35 (1) 40 777 39 47 61 MD-11*** 2 Total 281 381 527 * Deliveries in 2003 included intracompany deliveries of three 737 Next-Generation aircraft (two C-40 aircraft and one Project Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) System aircraft). Deliveries in 2002 included intracompany deliveries of four 737 Next-Generation aircraft (three C-40 aircraft and one Project Wedgetail AEW&C System aircraft). Deliveries in 2001 included intracompany deliveries of two 737 Next-Generation aircraft (two C-40 aircraft). ** Deliveries in 2003 also included an intracompany delivery of one 767 Tanker Transport aircraft for the Italian Air Force. *** Final deliveries of the MD-11 aircraft program occurred in 2001. The cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: Model 2003 2002 2001 717 125 113 93 737 Next-Generation 1,420 1,247 1,024 747 1,338 1,319 1,292 757 1,036 1,022 993 767 916 892 857 777 463 424 377 27 Table of Contents The undelivered units under firm order* as of December 31 were as follows: Model 2003 2002 2001 717 22 26 30 737 Next-Generation 800 765 857 747 32 52 59 757 13 28 55 767 25 39 77 777 159 173 198 * Firm orders represent new aircraft purchase agreements where the customers’ rights to cancel without penalty have expired. Typical customer rights to cancel without penalty include the customer receiving approval from its Board of Directors, shareholders, government and completing financing arrangements. All such cancellation rights must be satisfied or expired even if satisfying such conditions are highly certain. Firm orders exclude option aircraft and aircraft subject to reconfirmation. Total commercial jet aircraft deliveries for 2004 are currently projected to approximate 285 aircraft. For 2005, commercial jet aircraft deliveries are currently projected to be in the same range as 2004. As of January 29, 2004, the delivery forecast for 2004 is essentially sold out and approximately 90% sold for 2005. Commercial Airplanes segment revenues for 2004 are projected to be approximately $20 billion. Operating earnings Beginning in the first quarter of 2003, Commercial Airplanes segment operating earnings are presented based on the program accounting method. Prior year amounts, based on unit costing, have been revised to reflect the program method of accounting. (See Note 23.) This revision has no impact on amounts reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. During the third quarter of 2003, we decided to end production of the 757 program, with the final aircraft scheduled to be produced in late 2004 and delivered in the second quarter of 2005. The decision was based on a thorough assessment of market demand for the airplane. The decision resulted in a pre-tax earnings charge of $184 million. The decline in operating earnings in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the reduction in revenue as a result of lower delivery volume, a goodwill impairment charge of $341 million, a $184 million charge resulting from the decision to end production of the 757 program, and increased pension expense, all of which was partially offset by improved operating efficiency and reduced research and development expense. The decline in operating earnings in 2002 compared to 2001 was primarily due to the reduction in revenue as a result of lower delivery volume driven by the decline in the commercial aviation market; offset by improved operating efficiency and reduced research and development expense. In general, the commercial aviation market decline has resulted in the lengthening of the time needed to produce the accounting quantities, which is described below in the “Accounting Quantity” section. Accounting quantity For each airplane program, we estimate the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. We refer to this estimate as the “accounting quantity.” The accounting quantity for each program is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout the life of a program. See “Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Program accounting.” Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. We review and reassess our program accounting quantities on a quarterly basis in compliance with relevant program accounting guidance. 28 Table of Contents Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which do not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity increases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also increases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates, thus reducing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. In general, the market for commercial aircraft has adversely affected all of our commercial aircraft programs and extended the time frame for production and delivery of the accounting quantities used for program accounting. The estimate of total program accounting quantities and changes, if any, as of December 31 were: 717 737 Next-Generation 747 757 767 777 2003 148 2,200 1,388 1,050 975 650 Additions/(deletions) 8 200 (13 ) (50 ) (25 ) 50 2002 140 2,000 1,401 1,000 1,000 600 Additions 5 200 2001 135 1,800 1,401 1,000 1,000 600 Due to ongoing market uncertainty for the 717 aircraft, the accounting quantity for the 717 program has been based on firm orders since the fourth quarter of 2001. The 717 program accounting quantity was increased during 2003 due to the program obtaining additional firm orders. As of December 31, 2003, the majority of the remaining undelivered units of the 717 program consisted of 14 units to be delivered to a single customer. Due to the customer’s uncertain financial condition, on a consolidated basis, these aircraft are accounted for as long-term operating leases as they are delivered. The value of the inventory for the undelivered aircraft as of December 31, 2003, remained realizable. We have possible material exposures related to the 717 program, principally attributable to termination costs that could result from a lack of market demand. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we lost a major sales campaign, thus increasing the possibility of program termination. Program continuity is dependent on the outcomes of current sales campaigns. In the event of a program termination decision, current estimates indicate we could recognize a pre-tax earnings charge of approximately $400 million. The accounting quantity for the 737 Next-Generation program was increased during 2003 as a result of additional orders received since the last accounting quantity extension during 2002. Based on current demand, the time required to produce the December 31, 2002 accounting quantity for the 747 program would have extended beyond the limit allowed by our internal policy. Accordingly, the accounting quantity for this program was reduced during 2003. There was not a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as a result of the accounting quantity reduction. The decrease in the 757 program accounting quantity during 2003 was driven by the continued lack of demand for the 757 aircraft, which ultimately led to our decision in the third quarter of 2003 to end production of the program. The decrease in the 767 program accounting quantity during 2003 was due to the rescheduling of anticipated future 767 Tanker deliveries to the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Approximately 40% of the remaining deliveries in the current accounting quantity on the 767 program relates to the anticipated USAF tanker order. 29 Table of Contents The accounting quantity for the 777 program was increased during 2003, as a result of the program’s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be addressed. The percentage of anticipated orders included in the program accounting estimates as compared to the number of cumulative firm orders* as of December 31 were as follows: 717 737 Next-Generation 747 757 767 777 2003 Cumulative firm orders (CFO) 147 2,220 1,370 1,049 941 622 Anticipated orders N/A N/A 17 N/A 32 28 Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A 1 % N/A 3 % 5 % 2002 Cumulative firm orders 139 2,012 1,371 1,050 931 597 Anticipated orders 0 N/A 29 49 67 3 Anticipated orders as a % of CFO 0 % N/A 2 % 5 % 7 % 1 % 2001 Cumulative firm orders 123 1,881 1,351 1,048 934 575 Anticipated orders 11 N/A 49 51 64 25 Anticipated orders as a % of CFO 9 % N/A 4 % 5 % 7 % 4 % * Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31 (see table on page 27) plus undelivered units under firm order (see table on page 28). Cumulative firm orders include orders that fall within the current accounting quantities as well as orders that extend beyond the current accounting quantities. Cumulative firm orders exclude program test aircraft that will not be refurbished for sale. The U.S. Government is currently reviewing the USAF proposal for the purchase/lease combination of 100 767 Tankers. Discussions between the USAF and us have been paused, while a series of U.S. Government reviews is undertaken. As a result, on February 20, 2004, we announced that we will slow development efforts on the USAF 767 Tanker program. This slow down will result in the layoff of 100 contract employees and 50 employees, redeployment of certain other personnel, and an extension of the USAF 767 Tanker production schedule. If approved, delivery of the pre-modified aircraft from Commercial Airplanes to IDS is scheduled to begin in 2004. This anticipated order, which has a significant positive impact on the 767 program, has been incorporated into our program accounting estimates to the extent the aircraft fall within the current accounting quantity. Based on the forecasted delivery schedule and production rates the majority of these aircraft fall beyond the current accounting quantity. In order to meet the USAF’s proposed schedule for delivery, as of December 31, 2003 we have incurred inventoriable contract costs of $113 million, and if the order is not received, we would also incur supplier termination penalties of $63 million. The inventoriable costs are being deferred based on our assessment that it is probable the contract will be received. If the contract is not received, these deferred costs will be charged to expense and the 767 accounting quantity and the gross margin would be significantly reduced. This would result in a material negative impact to the program’s gross margin, and may impact the continuation of the 767 program. (See IDS USAF Tanker Program section for a discussion regarding the consolidated impact.) Deferred production costs Commercial aircraft inventory production costs incurred on in-process and delivered units in excess of the estimated average cost of such units, determined as described in Note 1, represent deferred 30 Table of Contents production costs. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, there were no significant excess deferred production costs or unamortized tooling costs not recoverable from existing firm orders for the 777 program. The deferred production costs and unamortized tooling included in the 777 program’s inventory at December 31 are summarized in the following table: 2003 2002 Deferred production costs $ 837 $ 785 Unamortized tooling 582 709 As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the balance of deferred production costs and unamortized tooling related to all other commercial aircraft programs was insignificant relative to the programs’ balance-to-go cost estimates. Fleet support We provide the operators of all our commercial airplane models assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals and technical consulting support, and continues throughout the operational life of the aircraft. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model’s fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. Research and development We continually evaluate opportunities to improve current aircraft models, and assess the marketplace to ensure that our family of commercial jet aircraft is well positioned to meet future requirements of the airline industry. The fundamental strategy is to maintain a broad product line that is responsive to changing market conditions by maximizing commonality among our family of commercial aircraft. Additionally, we are determined to continue to lead the industry in customer satisfaction by offering products with the highest standards of quality, safety, technical excellence, economic performance and in-service support. The decrease in 2003 research and development compared to 2002 was primarily due to reduced spending on the development of the 747-400ER. The decrease in 2002 research and development compared to 2001 was primarily due to reduced spending on the development of the 777-300ER and 747-400ER. The initial delivery of the 747-400ER and the rollout of the first 777-300ER occurred in the fourth quarter of 2002. The initial delivery of the 777-300ER is expected to occur during the first half of 2004. The initial delivery of the 737-900, the largest member of the 737 Next-Generation family, occurred in the second quarter of 2001. Despite the current downturn in the commercial aviation market, we remain confident in the long-term growth of air travel worldwide and the demand for new aircraft deliveries. We are currently focusing our new airplane product development efforts on the 7E7 program, which we expect to seat 200 to 250 passengers. In December of 2003, we received Board of Directors (BoD) approval to offer the new 31 Table of Contents airplane to customers. We began to formally offer the aircraft to airlines in early 2004. Subject to additional BoD approval, full development and production is scheduled to begin in 2004, with entry into service targeted for 2008. We project an increase in our research and development spending in 2004, primarily driven by spending on the 7E7 program. The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Backlog Contractual firm backlog for the Commercial Airplanes segment excludes customers we deem to be high risk or in bankruptcy as of the reporting date. The contractual backlog decline reflects the impact that the economic downturn has had on the airline industry. The decline in backlog in 2003 compared to 2002 and 2002 compared to 2001 represents higher delivery volume on all airplane programs relative to new orders. December 31, 2003, backlog does not include the anticipated order of 100 767 Tankers from the USAF. This order is anticipated to become a firm contract during 2004. Integrated Defense Systems Business Environment and Trends IDS is comprised of four reportable segments, which include A&WS, Network Systems, Support Systems and L&OS. IDS results reflect the new segment reporting structure effective January 1, 2003. Prior period results have been revised to reflect IDS’s new segment reporting format. The IDS business environment extends over multiple markets, including defense (A&WS, Network Systems and Support Systems segments), homeland security (Network Systems), space exploration (L&OS), and launch and satellites (L&OS). IDS derives over 85% of its revenue from sales to the U.S. Government and we are forecasting this business mix will remain at this level into the foreseeable future. Specifically, the primary customers of IDS are the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) for our products in the defense market, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for the homeland security market, NASA for the space exploration market, and the U.S. Government for the launch and satellites market. Since the trends associated with these markets impact IDS opportunities and risks in unique ways, the various environmental factors for each are discussed individually below. Defense environment overview The DoD represents nearly 50% of the world’s defense budget. The current defense environment is characterized by transformation and change in the face of shrinking force structure, aging platforms, and a level of operations and engagements worldwide that we expect will remain high for the foreseeable future. The United States’ leadership in the global war on terrorism demonstrates the value of networked intelligence, surveillance and communications, interoperability across platforms, services and forces, and the leveraging effects of precise, persistent, and selective engagement. The 32 Table of Contents significance and advantage of unmanned systems to perform many of these tasks is growing. These experiences are driving the DoD, along with militaries worldwide to transform their forces and the way they operate. Network-centric warfare is at the heart of this force transformation. We continue to see near-term growth in the DoD budget and a focus on transformation that will provide opportunities for IDS products in the future. However, with a softening global economy and anticipated federal budget deficits, allocations to DoD procurement are unlikely to increase significantly. This suggests that the DoD will continue to focus on affordability strategies emphasizing network-centric operations, joint interoperability, long range strike, unmanned air combat and reconnaissance vehicles, precision guided weapons and continued privatization of logistics and support activities as a means to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. Military transformation The defense transformation is evidenced by a trend toward smaller more capable, interoperable, and technologically advanced forces. To achieve these capabilities, a transformation in acquisition is underway that advances an increasing trend toward early deployment of initial program capabilities followed by subsequent incremental improvements, cooperative international development programs and a demonstrated willingness to explore new forms of development, acquisition and support. Along with these trends, new system procurements are being evaluated for the degree to which they support the concept of jointness and interoperability among the services. Institutions and events continue to shape the defense environment. The DoD’s implementation of a new Joint Capabilities Integration and Development Systems organization and process, along with revisions to the Defense Acquisition System, Program Planning Budgeting and Execution processes and the establishment of the Office of Force Transformation, has created a durable institutional foundation for continued transformation. Operations in the continuing global war on terrorism reaffirms the need for the rapid projection of decisive combat power around the world and emphasize the need for new capabilities and solutions for the warfighter. They also highlight the need for improved logistics and stability operation capabilities at completion of hostilities. Toward that end, the DoD is fully committed to a transformation that will achieve and maintain advantages through changes in operational concepts, organizational structure and technologies that significantly improve warfighting capabilities. Missile defense Another significant area of growth and transformation relates to efforts being made in missile defense. Funding for the missile defense market is primarily driven by the U.S. Government Missile Defense Agency (MDA) budget. The primary thrusts in this market are the continued development and deployment of theater missile defense systems and the Ground-Based Missile Defense (GMD) program. The overall MDA missile defense budget for 2004 is approximately $9 billion. Over the past year, emphasis has been placed on meeting President Bush’s call to deploy a national missile defense capability by late 2004. Congress demonstrated support for this effort, as the funding for deployment has remained a top MDA budget priority. Through IDS’s leadership position on the Missile Defense National Team and its prime contractor role on the GMD segment program and on the Airborne Laser program, IDS is positioned to maintain its role as MDA’s number one contractor. Defense competitive environment The global competitive environment continues to intensify, with increased focus on the U.S. defense market, the world’s largest and most attractive. IDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. BAE Systems and EADS continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. 33 Table of Contents We expect industry consolidation, partnering, and market concentration to continue. Prime contractors will continue to partner or serve as major suppliers to each other on various programs and will perform targeted acquisitions to fill technology or customer gaps. At the lower tiers, consolidation persists and select companies have been positioning for larger roles, especially in the Aerospace Support market. Homeland security environment The terrorist attacks on our nation on September 11, 2001 left a permanent impact on our government and the people and industries supporting it. President Bush issued an executive order establishing an Office of Homeland Security, and Governor Tom Ridge became the first Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security in January 2003. The Department of Homeland Security became official in March 2003 and the year 2003 was characterized by organizational challenges and a significant U.S. government transformation. Positions are being filled, organizational alignment is ongoing, and procurement practices are evolving. It is important to realize that this new department has been formed from existing agencies and their budgets, and therefore a large portion of the near-term budget is committed to heritage programs and staffing. Until some of these existing commitments are complete, funding for new opportunities will represent a small share of the overall Department of Homeland Security budget. We expect Homeland Security to be a stable market with minimal growth with emphasis being placed on Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. President Bush requested $36.2 billion in the fiscal year 2004 budget request to support the Department of Homeland Security. Significantly, $18.1 billion of this request is allocated to support strategic goals of improving border security and transportation security. This area includes initiatives such as the Explosive Detection System (EDS) program, Container Security Initiatives, and technology investments for non-intrusive inspection technology. As the prime contractor for the EDS contract, IDS successfully installed EDS systems in over 400 major airports in the United States in 2002 and continues to provide support and upgrades for this program. Only 50% of the federal spending on Homeland security is within the newly formed Department of Homeland Security. Other federal agencies such as the DoD still have homeland security and homeland defense funding under their direction. IDS will continue to leverage our experience as the systems integrator on the EDS program, our aviation heritage and our Integrated Battlespace and network-centric operations expertise and capabilities in the Homeland Security marketplace. Space exploration environment The total NASA budget is expected to remain flat over the next ten years, but it is forecasted that this budget will see a change in direction and emphasis. President Bush’s vision for exploration will not require large budget increases in the near term. Instead, it will bring about a sustained focus over time and reorientation of NASA’s programs. The funding added for exploration will total about $12 billion over the next five years. Most of this funding will be reallocated from existing areas as NASA reprioritizes to accomplish the President’s vision. The President requested an additional $1 billion for NASA’s existing five-year plan, or on average $200 million per year. We believe this allocation will be more significant in the first three years of the plan than the later two. The establishment of this new vision will provide great opportunities for industry to develop new technologies and operational concepts to take human beings beyond low-earth-orbit. IDS, with its strong heritage in the development of space systems and our expertise in the area of human space flight, including the Space Shuttle and International Space Station; is well positioned to work with and support our customer in accomplishing our goals. IDS will continue its work on the Space Shuttle and International Space Station programs along with development of critical technologies such as rocket propulsion and life support systems to prepare to meet the challenge of returning to the Moon and exploring the Solar Systems. Launch and satellite environment The commercial space market has softened significantly since the late 1990s in conjunction with the downturn in the telecommunications industry. This market is now characterized by overcapacity, 34 Table of Contents aggressive pricing and limited near term opportunities. Recent projections indicate these market conditions will persist until the end of this decade. We believe there will be lower commercial satellite orders through this decade, along with lower demand for commercial launch services. In this extremely limited market, we see a growing amount of overcapacity, which in turn is driving the continued deterioration of pricing conditions. We will continue to pursue profitable commercial satellite opportunities, where the customer values our technical expertise and unique solutions. However, we will not pursue commercial launches at a loss, and given the current pricing environment, we have decided, for the near-term, to focus our Delta IV program on the government launch market, which we believe is a more stable market. Inherent business risks Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, and Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets. The U.S. Government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, or may terminate for default based on our failure to meet specified performance measurements. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the U.S. Government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. Government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. On February 23, 2004, the U.S. Government announced plans to terminate for convenience the RA-66 Comanche contract. Boeing and United Technologies each had a 50% contractual relationship in the program. The announcement did not have an impact on 2003 financial results. The program represented less than 1% of our projected 2004 revenues. U.S. Government contracts also are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if appropriations for subsequent performance periods become unavailable. On research and development contracts, Congress usually appropriates funds on a Government-fiscal-year basis (September 30 year end), even though contract performance may extend over years. Many of our contracts are fixed-price contracts. While firm, fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. If the initial estimates we use to calculate the contract price prove to be incorrect, we can incur losses on those contracts. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost controls, schedule, and product performance. If we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, then we may not realize their full benefits. Our ability to manage costs on these contracts may affect our financial condition. Cost overruns may result in lower earnings, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results. Sales of our products and services internationally are subject not only to local government regulations and procurement policies and practices but also to the policies and approval of the U.S. Departments of State and Defense. The policies of some international customers require “industrial participation” agreements, which are discussed more fully in the “Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments” section. We are subject to business and cost classification regulations associated with our U.S. Government defense and space contracts. Violations can result in civil, criminal or administrative proceedings involving fines, compensatory and treble damages, restitution, forfeitures, and suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracts. We are currently in discussions with the U.S. Government regarding the allocability of certain pension costs which could be material. It is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these discussions. 35 Table of Contents 767 Tanker Program The U.S. Government is currently reviewing the USAF proposal for the purchase/lease combination of 100 767 Tankers. Discussions between the USAF and us have been paused, while a series of U.S. Government reviews is undertaken. As a result, on February 20, 2004, we announced that we will slow development efforts on the USAF 767 Tanker program. This slow down will result in the layoff of 100 contract employees and 50 employees, redeployment of certain other personnel, and an extension of the USAF 767 Tanker production schedule. Our current expectation is that it is probable we will receive the USAF tanker order in 2004. In the event the order is not received, we would write off tanker-related capitalized costs, and incur supplier termination penalties. On a consolidated basis, our potential charges would be $261 million as of December 31, 2003, consisting of $176 million related to the Commercial Airplanes segment, and $85 million related to the A&WS segment. Our total potential termination charge could reach approximately $310 million by March 31, 2004. (See Commercial Airplanes Accounting Quantity for related discussion.) Additionally, the outcome of the USAF proposal could also have an adverse impact on our margins associated with Italian and Japanese tanker contracts. The outcome of the USAF proposal could also have an impact on the amount of research and development expenditures that we would have to recognize. Sea Launch The Sea Launch venture, in which we are a 40% partner, provides ocean-based launch services to commercial satellite customers. In 2003, the venture conducted three successful launches with precision payload delivery in orbit. The venture continues to aggressively manage its cost structure. The venture is impacted by the commercial launch market risk discussed in the “Launch and Satellite Environment” section. We have previously issued credit guarantees to creditors of the Sea Launch venture to assist the venture in obtaining financing. In the event we are required to perform on these guarantees, we have the right to recover a portion of the loss from other venture partners, and have collateral rights to certain assets of the venture. We believe our total maximum exposure to loss from Sea Launch totals $226 million, taking into account recourse from other venture partners and estimated proceeds from collateral. The components of this exposure include $188 million ($801 million, net of $416 million in established reserves and $197 million in recourse from partners) of other assets and advances, $26 million for potential subcontract termination liabilities, and $12 million ($30 million net of $18 million in recourse from partners) of exposure related to performance guarantees provided by us to a Sea Launch customer. We also have outstanding credit guarantees with no net exposure ($519 million, net of $311 million in recourse from partners and $208 million in established reserves). We made no additional capital contributions to the Sea Launch venture during the year ended December 31, 2003. Delta IV In 1999, two employees were found to have in their possession certain information pertaining to a competitor, Lockheed Martin Corporation, under the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Program. The employees, one of whom was a former employee of Lockheed Martin, were terminated and a third employee was disciplined and resigned. In March 2003, the USAF notified us that it was reviewing our present responsibility as a government contractor in connection with the incident. In June 2003, Lockheed Martin filed a lawsuit against us and the three individual former employees arising from the same facts. It is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these matters or whether an adverse outcome would or could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, on July 24, 2003, the USAF suspended certain organizations in our space launch services business and the three former employees from receiving government contracts for an indefinite period as a direct result of alleged wrongdoing relating to possession of the Lockheed Martin information during the EELV source selection in 1998. The USAF also terminated 7 out of 21 of our EELV 36 Table of Contents launches previously awarded through a mutual contract modification and disqualified the launch services business from competing for three additional launches under a follow-on procurement. The same incident is under investigation by the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, who indicted two of the former employees in July 2003. Satellites Many of the existing satellite programs have very complex designs including unique phased array antenna designs. As is standard for this industry these programs are also fixed price in nature. As technical or quality issues arise, we have continued to experience schedule delays and cost impacts. We believe we have appropriately estimated costs to complete these contracts. However, if a major event arises, it could result in a material charge. These programs are on-going, and while we believe the cost estimates reflected in the December 31, 2003 financial statements are adequate, the technical complexity of the satellites create financial risk, as additional completion costs may become necessary, or scheduled delivery dates could be missed, which could trigger Termination for Default (TFD) provisions or other financially significant exposure. Additionally, in certain launch and satellite sales contracts, we include provisions for replacement launch services or hardware if we do not meet specified performance criteria. We have historically purchased insurance to cover these exposures when allowed under the terms of the contract. The current insurance market reflects unusually high premium rates and also suffers from a lack of capacity to handle all insurance requirements. We make decisions on the procurement of third-party insurance based on our analysis of risk. There is one contractual launch scheduled in late 2004 for which full insurance coverage may not be available, or if available, could be prohibitively expensive. We will continue to review this risk. We estimate that the potential uninsured amount for this launch could be approximately $100 million. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 27,361 $ 24,957 $ 22,815 % of Total Company Revenues 54 % 46 % 39 % Operating Earnings $ 766 $ 2,009 $ 1,965 Operating Margins 2.8 % 8.0 % 8.6 % Research and Development $ 846 $ 742 $ 784 Contractual Backlog $ 40,883 $ 36,014 $ 30,741 Revenues The increase in IDS revenues from 2002 to 2003 was primarily driven by additional production aircraft and Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM) deliveries and F/A-22 Raptor volume in A&WS increased volume in homeland security, proprietary programs and the start up of Future Combat Systems in Network Systems; increased volume in spares, maintenance and Life Cycle Customer Support (LCCS) in Support Systems; and increased Delta launch deliveries in L&OS. Increased revenues from 2001 to 2002 were primarily driven by additional aircraft, rotorcraft and JDAM deliveries from production programs and amounts recognized on a cost-reimbursement basis for development programs such as F/A-22 Raptor and V-22 Osprey in A&WS increased volume in Missile Defense in Network Systems and increased volume in spares, modernization, maintenance and LCCS in Support Systems. 37 Table of Contents Operating earnings The decrease in IDS’s operating earnings from 2002 to 2003 reflects increased operating losses recorded for the L&OS segment, partially offset by strong performance from the A&WS, Network Systems and Support Systems segments. A&WS earnings were driven by strong performance from the segment’s major production programs and an increased revenue base as well as 2002 cost growth that did not impact 2003. Support Systems also had another outstanding year driven by an increased revenue base along with improved performance in many of the segment’s businesses. Network Systems segment earnings improved from 2002 primarily due to increased revenues in homeland security, Future Combat Systems and proprietary programs, partially offset by cost growth on military satellite programs and a $55 million pre-tax non-cash charge related to our investment in a joint venture that lost an imagery contract award, as a result this venture has now been dissolved. The L&OS segment was impacted by a goodwill impairment charge of $572 million and a charge of $1.0 billion as a result of continued weakness in the commercial space launch market, higher mission and launch costs on the Delta IV program, and cost growth in the satellite business. L&OS earnings in 2003 were also adversely impacted by adjustments to certain joint venture investments resulting in a net write-down of $27 million. Operating results increased slightly from 2001 to 2002 primarily due to strong performance from the A&WS and Support Systems segments, while the Network Systems segment was impacted by a 737 Airborne Early Warning & Control $100 million development cost growth. The L&OS segment was impacted by cost growth on satellite programs, a $100 million pre-tax charge to write-down an equity investment and continued downturn in the launch and commercial satellite market. Backlog The increase in contractual backlog of 14% from 2002 to 2003 is attributed to the capture of orders for Apache helicopters by Greece & Kuwait, the F/A-18 E/F Multi Year II contract and the initial funding for the EA-18G from the U.S. Navy in the A&WS segment. Network Systems backlog grew primarily from orders received for the GMD and Turkey 737 AEW&C programs coupled with the initial funding of the Future Combat Systems program. Support Systems backlog grew primarily from orders received for C-17 sustainment and KC-10 support. L&OS backlog decreased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to Delta IV EELV contract terminations. The increase in contractual backlog of 17% from 2001 to 2002 is primarily attributed to the capture of several key international awards including the Korean F-15 Eagle contract and the Italian 767 Tanker contract, coupled with production rate increases on several domestic programs in the A&WS segment. Network Systems backlog grew primarily from orders received from the Department of Transportation for Airport Security and orders received for proprietary programs. Support Systems backlog also grew from the previously mentioned Korean and Italian awards and a C-17 sustainment contract. L&OS backlog remained constant from 2001 to 2002 with orders for Delta IV launch vehicles and a NASA award for space flight payload processing offsetting the decline in commercial satellite backlog. Aircraft & Weapon Systems (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 10,766 $ 10,569 $ 9,575 % of Total Company Revenues 21 % 20 % 16 % Operating Earnings $ 1,422 $ 1,269 $ 1,032 Operating Margins 13.2 % 12.0 % 10.8 % Research and Development $ 360 $ 304 $ 209 Contractual Backlog $ 19,352 $ 15,862 $ 14,767 38 Table of Contents Revenues A&WS increased revenues in 2003 were primarily driven by additional deliveries on JDAM, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15E Eagle and F/A-22 Raptor volume, partially offset by lower rotorcraft deliveries. The increase in revenues between 2002 and 2001 were due to increased aircraft deliveries on C-17 Globemaster, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15E Eagle, AH-64 Apache and JDAM. Deliveries of units for principal production programs, including deliveries under operating lease, which are identified by parentheses, were as follows: 2003 2002 2001 C-17 Globemaster 16 16 14 (4) F/A-18E/F Super Hornet 44 40 36 T-45TS Goshawk 12 14 15 F-15E Eagle 4 3 CH-47 Chinook * 7 11 737 C-40A Clipper 1 3 4 AH-64 Apache * 15 7 * New Builds Only Operating earnings A&WS 2003 operating earnings reflect increased revenues, strong performance on our major production programs and a $45 million favorable adjustment related to the F-15 Eagle program. The favorable adjustment represents usage in 2003 of some of the inventory we impaired in 1999. The 2002 earnings results reflect strong profits on our major production programs. 2002 results also include a gain of $42 million related to the divestiture of an equity investment and a favorable adjustment of $24 million attributable to F-15 Eagle program charges taken in 1999. The segment operating earnings for 2001 include the recognition of $48 million of charges relating to asset reductions attributable to reduced work volume at the Philadelphia site, and $46 million of charges associated with the Joint Strike Fighter program and idle manufacturing assets. The 2001 operating earnings also included a favorable adjustment of $57 million attributable to F-15 Eagle program charges taken in 1999. Research and development The A&WS segment continues to pursue business opportunities where it can use its customer knowledge, technical strength and large-scale integration capabilities to provide transformational solutions. Research and development activities continue to be focused on the 767 Tanker program, as reflected in the increased expenditures in 2002 and 2003 over 2001. This program represents a significant opportunity to provide state of the art refueling capabilities to potential domestic and international customers. It demonstrates the synergistic value of our diversified company-wide portfolio in providing best value solutions to our customers. Italy and Japan have signed contracts for the 767 Tanker system with first aircraft delivery scheduled in 2005, and discussions continue with the USAF on how we may fulfill their tanker requirement. The outcome of the USAF proposal could have an impact on the amount of research and development expenditures that we would incur. Investments in Unmanned Systems continue to leverage our capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies to provide transformational capabilities for the U.S. military. This segment’s research and development expenditures are focused on unmanned systems programs and technologies, and reflect the current business environment. Other research and development efforts include upgrade and technology insertions to enhance the capability and competitiveness of current product lines such as Airborne Electronic Attack, Precision Weapons and advanced Rotorcraft systems. 39 Table of Contents Backlog The increase in contractual backlog from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributed to the capture of several key awards including the F/A-18 E/F Multi Year II contract, Apache helicopter new builds, and the initial funding for the EA-18G. Backlog also increased due to rate increase on the F/A-22 low rate initial production and weapon orders for Small Diameter Bomb (SDB), Harpoon, and SLAM-ER. The increase in contractual backlog of 7% from 2001 to 2002 is primarily attributed to the capture of several key international awards including the Korean F-15 Eagle contract and the Italian 767 Tanker contract. Backlog also increased due to rate increases on several domestic programs in low rate initial production including V-22 Osprey and the F/A-22 Raptor. The F/A-18E/F Super Hornet program backlog increased moderately as the customer continues to increase production rate. The JDAM program backlog also increased moderately with additional orders from both the Navy and Air Force. On February 23, 2004, the U.S. Government announced plans to terminate for convenience the RA-66 Comanche contract. Boeing and United Technologies each had a 50% contractual relationship in the program. The announcement did not have an impact on 2003 financial results. The program represented less than 1% of our projected 2004 revenues. Network Systems (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 9,384 $ 8,113 $ 5,972 % of Total Company Revenues 19 % 15 % 10 % Operating Earnings $ 626 $ 546 $ 482 Operating Margins 6.7 % 6.7 % 8.1 % Research and Development $ 195 $ 132 $ 196 Contractual Backlog $ 11,715 $ 6,700 $ 4,749 Revenues Increased revenues for the Network Systems segment in 2003 were primarily driven by increased activity in proprietary and homeland security programs, ramp up of the Future Combat Systems program and the successful launch of a Naval satellite (UHF F11). The increase in revenues from 2001 to 2002 is primarily due to increased activity in network centric warfare activity and Missile Defense. Operating earnings Network Systems 2003 earnings results were primarily driven by increased revenue mentioned earlier. 2003 results were adversely impacted by cost growth on military satellite programs and a $55 million pre-tax non-cash charge related to our investment in Resource 21, a venture that lost an imagery contract award, and as a result the venture has now been dissolved. 2002 results were impacted by cost growth on military satellite programs and the 737 AEW&C development program. Network Systems 2002 earnings increased relative to 2001 primarily due to the increased revenue offset partially by charges mentioned above. Research and development The Network Systems research and development funding continues to be focused on the development of communications and command & control capabilities that support a network-centric architecture approach. We are investing in the communications market to enable connectivity between existing air/ground platforms, increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and leverage innovative communications concepts. Investments were made in Global Situational Awareness concepts to develop communication system architectures in order to support various business opportunities including Future Combat Systems, Joint Tactical Radio System, FAB-T and GMD. A major contributor to our support of these DoD transformation programs is the investment in the Boeing Integration Center (BIC) where our network-centric operations concepts are developed in 40 Table of Contents partnership with our customers. We will also continue to make focused investments that will lead to the development of next-generation space intelligence systems. Along with slightly increased funding to support this area of architecture and network-centric capabilities development, we also increased our investment in advanced missile defense concepts. Also, in 2003 we made a significant decision and allocated a larger investment than in previous years to continue to pursue the homeland security market. Research and development funding was used to develop and tailor the network-centric capabilities, already being applied to many DoD opportunities in this emerging market. Backlog The 75% increase in contractual backlog from 2002 to 2003 is mainly attributed to orders for the GMD and Turkey 737 AEW&C programs coupled with the initial funding of the Future Combat Systems program. The increase in contractual backlog of 41% from 2001 to 2002 is primarily attributed to the capture of orders for proprietary programs and an order by the Department of Transportation for Airport Security. Support Systems (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 4,219 $ 3,484 $ 2,931 % of Total Company Revenues 8 % 6 % 5 % Operating Earnings $ 472 $ 376 $ 304 Operating Margins 11.2 % 10.8 % 10.4 % Research and Development $ 59 $ 43 $ 51 Contractual Backlog $ 5,882 $ 5,286 $ 2,963 Revenues Support Systems increased revenues in 2003 were driven by increased volume in spares for tactical aircraft, LCCS, Maintenance & Modification, and Contractor Logistical Support & Services (CLSS). Increased revenues between 2002 and 2001 were primarily driven by increased volume in spares for tactical aircraft, Modernization and Upgrade, LCCS and Maintenance & Modification. Operating earnings Support Systems operating earnings increased in 2003 and 2002, primarily due to the higher base of revenues identified above. 2003 operating earnings were also improved due to performance in the Spares & Technical Data and LCCS businesses. 2002 operating earnings also benefited from improved performance in the Maintenance & Modification and LCCS businesses along with a non-recurring gain related to the divestiture of an equity investment. Research and development Support Systems continue to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including CLSS, LCCS, Maintenance and Modifications, Modernization and Upgrades, Spares and Technical Data, and Training Systems and Services. We have made investments to continue the development and implementation of innovative disciplined tools, processes and systems as market discriminators. Examples of successful programs stemming from the investments include the C-17 Globemaster Sustainment Partnership, C-130U Gunship 4 Buy and C-130 Avionics modernization program. Backlog The increase in contractual backlog of 11% from 2002 to 2003 is attributed to orders for C-17 sustainment and KC-10 support as well as orders in the CLSS business. The increase in contractual 41 Table of Contents backlog of 78% from 2001 to 2002 is attributed to growth throughout the various Aerospace Support businesses. Primary contributors were the follow-on order for the C-17 sustainment contract, Italian 767 Tanker Integrated Fleet Support and Korean F-15 spares and ground support equipment. Launch & Orbital Systems (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 2,992 $ 2,791 $ 4,337 % of Total Company Revenues 6 % 5 % 7 % Operating Earnings / (Losses) $ (1,754 ) $ (182 ) $ 147 Operating Margins (58.6 )% (6.5 )% 3.4 % Research and Development $ 232 $ 263 $ 328 Contractual Backlog $ 3,934 $ 8,166 $ 8,262 Revenues Higher L&OS revenues in 2003 were primarily driven by increased Delta launch deliveries. Decreased revenues between 2002 and 2001 were primarily driven by the downturn in the launch and commercial satellite market. Deliveries of production units were as follows: 2003 2002 2001 Delta II 4 3 12 Delta IV 2 1 Satellites 3 6 7 Operating earnings L&OS 2003 operating earnings were negatively impacted by a first quarter goodwill impairment charge of $572 million and a second quarter charge of $1 billion based on continued weakness in the commercial space launch market, higher mission and launch costs on the Delta IV program, and cost growth in the satellite business. The 2003 results also include adjustments we made to our equity investments in Ellipso, SkyBridge and the liquidation of our investment in Teledesic resulting in a net write-down of $27 million. The 2002 results include a $100 million pre-tax charge to write-down our equity investment in Teledesic, LLC. Also contributing to the 2002 decreased operating earnings was cost growth on commercial satellite programs and the continued downturn in the launch and commercial satellite market. The 2001 operating results were driven by increased volume on International Space Station offset by investments in the Delta IV expendable launch vehicle and RS-68 engine. In 2003, we continued a reorganization of our commercial satellite manufacturing activities in response to poor performance compounded by unfavorable market conditions. The impact to earnings by satellite program cost growth was partially offset by favorable contractual actions. Progress has been made in implementing process improvements and program management best practices, however, factory problems identified during acceptance testing continue to impact existing contracts. As a result, completion schedules have slipped exposing us to a first quarter 2004 risk of $125 million for contract TFD. In the first quarter of 2004, we will approach the TFD date on a commercial satellite contract, however we believe a TFD on this contract is not likely due to continuing production and contractual efforts in process. We are a 50-50 partner with Lockheed Martin in a joint venture called United Space Alliance, which is responsible for all ground processing of the Space Shuttle fleet and for space-related operations with 42 Table of Contents the USAF. United Space Alliance also performs modifications, testing and checkout operations that are required to ready the Space Shuttle for launch. United Space Alliance operations are performed under cost-plus-type contracts. Our 50% share of joint venture earnings is recognized as income. The segment’s operating earnings include earnings of $52 million, $68 million and $72 million, for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, attributable to United Space Alliance. These results include all known or expected impacts related to the Space Shuttle program based on the findings from the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) investigation. Research and development Our research and development investment in L&OS declined as some versions of the Delta IV expendable launch vehicle reached operational status. Continued investment in the Delta IV program into 2004 will be made to support the demonstration flight of the Delta IV Heavy vehicle. We also continue to make investments in this segment to develop technologies and systems solutions to support our NASA customer in the development of new space systems. We have also prudently invested research and development resources in the satellite manufacturing business to enhance existing designs to meet evolving customer requirements. Backlog The contractual backlog decrease of 52% in 2003 was primarily due to the adjustment in the Delta IV Launch manifest. The adjustment was a result of missions lost on the EELV (see “EELV Suspension” in 2004 Risk Factors section) contract and a continued weakness in the commercial space market and sales on the existing orders. Additional factors that resulted in a decrease in contractual backlog for 2003 were termination of a Loral launch contract due to a customer’s financial solvency and a customer’s conversion of three satellite orders to future options. Contractual backlog remained constant from 2001 to 2002 with higher orders for Delta IV launch vehicles and a NASA award for space flight payload processing partially offset by a decline in commercial satellite backlog due to decreased new orders and sales on existing orders. Boeing Capital Corporation Business Environment and Trends Historically, BCC has acted as a captive finance subsidiary by providing market-based lease and loan financing for commercial aircraft as well as commercial equipment. In November 2003, we announced a significant change in BCC’s strategic direction, moving from a focus on growing the portfolio to a focus on supporting our major operating units and managing overall corporate exposures. For our commercial aircraft market, BCC will facilitate, arrange and selectively provide financing to Commercial Airplanes’ customers. For our defense and space markets, BCC will primarily arrange and structure financing solutions for IDS’s government customers. In addition, BCC will enhance its risk management activities to reduce exposures associated with the current portfolio. BCC expects to satisfy any external funding needs through access to traditional market funding sources. BCC competes in the commercial equipment leasing and finance markets, primarily in the United States, against a number of competitors, mainly larger leasing companies and banks. BCC’s Commercial Financial Services’ portfolio encompasses multiple industries and a wide range of equipment, including corporate aircraft, machine tools and production equipment, containers and marine equipment, chemical, oil and gas equipment and other equipment types. Historically, approximately 20% of BCC’s portfolio was related to commercial equipment leasing and financing activities. In January 2004, we announced that we are exploring strategic alternatives for the future of BCC’s Commercial Financial Services business. The alternatives being examined include a sale of the operation itself, sale of the portfolio or a phased wind-down of the existing portfolio. We have no fixed timetable for determining the future of this business. 43 Table of Contents Refer to discussion of the airline industry environment in the Commercial Airplanes Business Environments and Trends. The downturn in the airline industry has resulted in reduced collateral values for aircraft, declines in airline credit ratings and bankruptcy filings by certain of our airline customers. These events have resulted in our recognition of non-cash charges in 2003 and 2002 in order to strengthen our allowance for losses on receivables and to recognize impairments on certain assets. Any additional impact that we may incur is dependent upon the duration of the current airline industry decline and the related defaults, repossessions or restructurings that may occur. Aircraft valuations could decline materially if significant numbers of aircraft are removed from service due to additional airline bankruptcies or restructurings. Aircraft values and lease rates are also being impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service due to overcapacity. Slightly over 2,000 aircraft (12% of world fleet) have been out of service for most of 2003, including aircraft types in production. In years prior to 2001, the out of service fleet was approximately 4% to 6% of the world fleet, which was mainly comprised of aircraft that were out of production. Aircraft values and lease rates should improve as aircraft are returned to service. In October 2003, Commercial Airplanes announced the decision to end production of the 757 program in late 2004; however, we will continue to support the aircraft. While we continue to believe in the utility and marketability of the 757, we are unable to predict how the end of production, as well as overall market conditions, may impact 757 collateral values. At December 31, 2003, $1.4 billion of BCC’s portfolio was collateralized by 757 aircraft of various vintages and variants. Should the 757 suffer a significant decline in utility and market acceptance, the aircraft’s collateral values may decline which could result in an increase to the allowance for losses on receivables. Also, BCC may experience a decline in rental rates, which could result in additional impairment charges on operating lease aircraft. While BCC is unable to determine the likelihood of these impacts occuring, such impacts could result in a potential material adverse effect on BCC’s earnings and/or financial position. Due to ongoing market uncertainty for 717 aircraft, possible material exposures exist related to the 717 program. (See Commercial Airplanes segment discussion). At December 31, 2003, $2.2 billion of BCC’s portfolio was collateralized by 717 aircraft. We are unable to predict how the possible end of production, as well as overall market conditions, would impact 717 collateral values. In the event of a program termination decision, the aircraft’s collateral values may decline resulting in an increase to the allowance for losses on receivables. This could lead to a potential material adverse effect on BCC’s earnings and/or financial position. As of December 31, 2003, there were $278 million of assets, principally commercial aircraft that were held for sale or re-lease at BCC, of which $122 million had a firm contract to sell or place on lease. Additionally, approximately $332 million of BCC’s assets are currently scheduled to come off lease in 2004 and become subject to replacement into the market. The inability of BCC to sell or place these assets into a revenue-generating service could pose a potential risk to results of operations. Airlines regularly utilize a special purpose entity (SPE) known as a Pass Through Trust. The Pass Through Trust enables the airline to aggregate a large number of aircraft secured notes into one trust vehicle, facilitating the issuance of larger bonds called Pass Through Certificates (PTCs). The most common form of PTCs issued by airlines is the EETC. EETCs provide investors with tranched rights to cash flows from a financial instrument, as well as stratified collateral positions in the related asset. While the underlying classes of equipment notes vary by maturity and/or coupon depending upon tenor or level of subordination of the specific equipment notes and their corresponding claim on the aircraft, the basic function of the Pass Through Trust in an EETC remains: to passively hold separate debt investments to enhance liquidity for investors, whom in turn pass this liquidity benefit directly to the 44 Table of Contents airline in the form of lower coupon and/or greater debt capacity. BCC participates in several EETCs as an investor typically in the last-position tranche. The EETC investments are related to customers we believe to have less than investment-grade credit. BCC also routinely utilizes SPEs to isolate individual transactions for legal liability, perfect its security interest and that of third-party lenders in certain leveraged transactions, and to realize certain income and sales tax benefits. These SPEs are fully consolidated in BCC’s and our financial statements. Significant Customer Contingencies A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is concentrated among commercial airline customers. Certain customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or requested lease or loan restructurings; these negotiations were in various stages as of December 31, 2003. These bankruptcies or restructurings could have a material adverse effect on BCC’s earnings, cash flows or financial position. United Airlines (United) accounted for $1.2 billion (9.5% and 10.1%) of BCC’s total portfolio at December 31, 2003 and 2002. At December 31, 2003, the United portfolio was secured by security interests in two 767s and 13 777s and by an ownership and security interest in five 757s. As of December 31, 2003, United was BCC’s second largest customer. United filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on December 9, 2002. During 2003, BCC completed a restructuring of United’s aircraft loans and leases. The receivables associated with a security interest in the two 767s and 13 777s were restructured with terms that did not necessitate a troubled debt restructuring charge to the allowance for losses on receivables. The lease terms attributable to the five 757s in which BCC holds an ownership and security interest were revised in a manner that reclassified these leases as operating leases. Additionally, BCC previously assigned to a third party the rights to a portion of the lease payments on these five 757s. As a result of this lease restructuring, as of December 31, 2003, BCC recorded operating lease equipment with a value of $84 million and non-recourse debt of $42 million (representing the obligation attributable to the assignment of future lease proceeds). As of December 31, 2003, United is current on all of its obligations related to these 20 aircraft. United retains certain rights by virtue of operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including the right to reject the restructuring terms with its creditors and return aircraft, including our aircraft. The terms of BCC’s restructuring with United, which were approved by the federal bankruptcy court, set forth the terms under which all 20 aircraft BCC financed are expected to remain in service upon United’s emergence from Chapter 11 protection. If United exercises its right to reject the agreed upon restructuring terms, the terms of all of the leases and loans revert to the original terms, which terms are generally less favorable to United. United would retain its right under Chapter 11 to return the aircraft in the event of a reversion to the original lease and loan terms. American Trans Air Holdings Corp. (ATA) accounted for $743 million and $611 million (6.1% and 5.2%) of BCC’s total portfolio at December 31, 2003 and 2002. At December 31, 2003, the ATA portfolio included 12 757s and an investment in preferred stock. In November 2002, ATA received a loan of $168 million administered by the Airline Transportation Stabilization Board. During 2003, BCC agreed to restructure certain outstanding leases by extending their terms and deferring a portion of ATA’s rent payments for a limited period of time. The terms of the restructured leases did not result in a charge to the allowance for losses on receivables. ATA must meet certain requirements for the terms of the restructured leases to remain in effect. These requirements included the completion of an exchange offering on its publicly traded debt, which would result in a deferral of the principal debt maturity date. ATA satisfied those requirements on January 30, 2004. Hawaiian Holdings, Inc. (Hawaiian) accounted for $509 million and $479 million (4.2% and 4.1%) of BCC’s total portfolio at December 31, 2003 and 2002. At December 31, 2003, the Hawaiian portfolio primarily consisted of 12 717s and three 767s. Hawaiian filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on 45 Table of Contents March 21, 2003. With bankruptcy court approval, BCC has reached an agreement releasing Hawaiian from its obligation to take delivery of a new 767 that was scheduled for delivery to Hawaiian in April 2003. This aircraft was sold to a third party in October 2003. Similarly, BCC agreed to permit Hawaiian to return two 717s it leased from BCC. BCC has arranged for these 717s to be leased to a third party. On February 11, 2004, we announced BCC’s support for a plan to restructure Hawaiian. The restructuring would include among other things, a revision of BCC’s lease terms and result in a substantial decrease in rental receipts from Hawaiian. This plan is subject to approval by the bankruptcy court and Hawaiian’s creditors. Taking into account the specific reserves for the Hawaiian receivables, BCC does not expect that the transactions with Hawaiian will have a material adverse effect on its earnings and/or financial position. In the event that future negotiations or proceedings result in the return of a substantial number of aircraft, there could be a material adverse effect on BCC’s earnings, cash flows or financial position, at least until such time as the aircraft are sold or redeployed for adequate consideration. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) 2003 2002 2001 Revenues $ 1,221 $ 994 $ 815 % of Total Company Revenues 2 % 2 % 1 % Operating Earnings $ 143 $ 72 $ 238 Operating Margins 11.7 % 7.2 % 29.2 % Portfolio $ 12,248 $ 11,762 $ 9,198 % of Portfolio in Valuation Allowance 4.7 % 3.5 % 2.4 % Debt $ 9,177 $ 9,465 $ 7,295 Debt-to-Equity Ratio 4.7-to-1 5.7-to-1 5.3-to-1 Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of interest from financing receivables and notes, lease income from operating lease equipment, investment income, gains on disposals of investments and gains/losses on revaluation of derivatives. The overall growth in revenues for BCC over the past three years was principally driven by a larger portfolio, resulting from new business volume and portfolio transfers from other segments in 2002 and 2001. While the numbers above demonstrate revenue growth of approximately 23% in 2003 and 22% in 2002, BCC does not expect such growth in the future due to the change in its business strategy described in the Business Environment and Trends section above. In addition, during 2003, BCC’s net gain on disposal was $49 million as compared to $8 million in 2002 and $34 million in 2001. The increase was due to the sale of an investment in a single SPE arrangement in 2003. These gains are sporadic in nature and depend in part on market conditions at the time of disposal. There can be no assurance that BCC will recognize such gains in the future. Operating earnings BCC’s earnings are presented net of interest expense, valuation allowance adjustments, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. The increase in 2003 operating earnings was primarily attributable to the increase in revenues discussed above, partially offset by increased interest expense, valuation allowance and impairment charges. Financing related interest expense increased to $442 million for 2003 when compared to $410 million for 2002 and $324 million for 2001. As summarized in the following table, during the year ended December 31, 2003, we recognized pre-tax expenses of $320 million in response to the deterioration in the credit worthiness of BCC’s 46 Table of Contents airline customers, airline bankruptcy filings and the continued decline in the commercial aircraft and general equipment asset values, of which $254 million related to BCC. For the same period in 2002, we recognized pre-tax expenses of $426 million, of which $200 million related to BCC. (Dollars in millions) BCCSegment Other Segment Consolidated 2003 Increased valuation allowance $ 130 $ 61 $ 191 Revaluation of equipment on operating lease or held for sale or re-lease 103 5 108 Other adjustments 21 21 $ 254 $ 66 $ 320 2002 Increased valuation allowance $ 100 $ 80 $ 180 Impairment of investment in ETCs 13 66 79 Impairment of joint venture aircraft 48 48 Other asset impairments 39 80 119 $ 200 $ 226 $ 426 In light of the decline in the creditworthiness of its customers over the past two years, BCC has substantially increased the valuation allowance. BCC recorded a $130 million charge to earnings in 2003 compared to $100 million in 2002 to increase the valuation allowance. The Other segment recorded a $61 million charge to earnings in 2003 compared to $80 million in 2002. The valuation allowance did not increase significantly in 2001. Additionally, because aircraft equipment values have dropped significantly over the past few years, BCC recognized asset impairment-related charges of $124 million, of which $21 million was due to the write-off of forward-starting interest rate swaps related to Hawaiian in 2003. During 2002, BCC recognized charges of $100 million, which consist of $13 million related to investments in ETCs, charges of $48 million due to impairments of joint venture aircraft and charges of $39 million related to other assets in the portfolio. Additionally, the Other segment recognized charges of $5 million in 2003. During 2002, the Other segment recognized charges of $146 million, which consist of $66 million related to investments in ETCs and charges of $80 million related to other assets in the portfolio, of which $66 million related to the return of 24 717s by AMR Corporation. BCC carefully monitors the relative value of aircraft equipment since we remain at substantial economic risk to significant decreases in the value of aircraft equipment and their associated lease rates. While equipment risk is inherent in our business, this risk has been magnified over the past few years by the lingering weakness in the airline industry and the resulting oversupply of aircraft equipment. Total impairment charges were not significant in 2001. Other Segment The increase in Other segment operating losses in 2003 reflects higher investments in Connexion by BoeingSM, decreased revenues in Boeing Technology, lower customer financing revenues and lower pension income. Connexion by BoeingSM continues to prepare for launch of commercial service in early 2004. Connexion by BoeingSM signed initial service agreements with Japan Airlines and All Nippon Airways for 10 aircraft each bringing the total number of aircraft under contract for its service to 119. Boeing Technology experienced decreased revenues due to the transfer of certain programs to IDS. Lower customer financing earnings also contributed to the increase in Other segment operating losses. Additionally, we recognized lower pension income as a result of declining interest rates and negative pension asset returns in 2001 and 2002, the impact of which is amortized into earnings in future periods. 47 Table of Contents During the years 2003, 2002 and 2001, operating earnings of $69 million, $69 million and $36 million, respectively, were attributable to four C-17 transport aircraft on lease to the United Kingdom Royal Air Force, which began in 2001. Offsetting the 2002 and 2001 operating earnings of the C-17 leases were increases in losses primarily due to increases in intracompany guarantees and asset impairments, lease accounting differences and other subsidies related to BCC. Research and development activities in the Other segment relate primarily to Connexion by BoeingSM and, to a lesser extent, Air Traffic Management. Research and development activities in the Other segment remained constant in 2003. Astro Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary, operates as a captive insurance company. This subsidiary enables certain of our exposures to be insured at the lowest possible cost to us. In addition, it provides flexibility to us in structuring our insurance and risk management programs and provides access to the reinsurance markets. Currently, Astro Ltd. insures a portion of our aviation liability, workers compensation, general liability, property, as well as various smaller risk liability insurances. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET IMPLEMENTED Application of Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used predominately by the segments within IDS. The majority of business conducted in these segments is performed under contracts with the U.S. Government and foreign governments that extend over a number of years. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Sales related to contracts with fixed prices are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contract’s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions are made regarding the length of time to complete each contract because estimated costs also include expected changes in wages, prices for materials, fixed costs, and other costs. 48 Table of Contents Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. Excluding one time charges related to a downturn in the commercial space market, 2003 performance fell within the historical range of plus or minus 0.5% change to gross margin. If combined gross margin for all contracts in IDS for all of 2003 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 0.5%, it would have increased or decreased income for the year by approximately $137 million. Program Accounting We use program accounting to account for sales and cost of sales related to our 7-series commercial airplane programs. Program accounting is a method of accounting applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling costs and warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling, and warranty costs for the total program. (See Commercial Airplanes discussion in the Accounting Quantity section.) The use of estimates in program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. Factors that must be estimated include sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured parts, major component costs, and overhead costs. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are recognized on a prospective basis. Underlying all estimates used for program accounting is the forecasted market and corresponding production rates. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. The sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer during the quarter. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new airplane program (known as the “learning curve effect”), 49 Table of Contents the actual costs incurred for production of the early units in the program will exceed the amount reported as cost of sales for those units. The excess or actual costs over the amount reported as cost of sales is presented as “deferred production costs,” which are included in inventory along with unamortized tooling costs. Our experience in the last two years, with all current programs being relatively mature, has been that estimated changes due to model mix, escalation, cost performance, and accounting quantity adjustments have resulted in a net range of plus or minus 0.5% for the combined cost of sales percentages of all commercial airplane programs. If combined cost of sales percentages for all commercial airplane programs for all of 2003 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 0.5%, it would have increased or decreased income for 2003 by approximately $90 million. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into specified-price trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally ten years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If, in the future, we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Based on our historical experience, we believe that very few, if any, of our outstanding contingent repurchase commitments will ultimately become trade-in commitments. Exposure related to the trade-in of used aircraft resulting from trade-in commitments may take the form of: (1) adjustments to revenue related to the sale of new aircraft determined at the signing of a definitive agreement, and/or (2) charges to cost of products and services related to adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for new aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. The trade-in aircraft exposure related to item (2) above is recorded in ‘Accounts payable and other liabilities’ on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Obligations related to probable trade-in commitments are measured as the difference between gross amounts payable to customers and the estimated fair value of the collateral. The fair value of collateral is determined using aircraft specific data such as, model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets to which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, (1) the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage, (2) the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customer’s requirements, or (3) the scrap market. Collateral valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. This quarterly collateral valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft. Based on the best market information available at the time, it is probable that we would be obligated to perform on trade-in commitments with gross amounts payable to customers totaling $582 million and $1.4 billion as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Accounts payable and other liabilities included $65 million and $156 million as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, which represents the exposure related to these trade-in commitments. 50 Table of Contents Using a measurement date of December 31, 2003, had the estimate of collateral value used to calculate our obligation related to trade-in commitments been 10% higher or lower than our actual assessment, accounts payable and other liabilities would have decreased or increased by approximately $52 million. We continually update our assessment of the likelihood of our trade-in aircraft purchase commitments and continue to monitor all these commitments for adverse developments. Asset valuation for equipment under operating lease, held for re-lease, held for sale and collateral on receivables Included in ‘Customer and commercial financing, net’ assets are operating lease equipment and notes receivables. In addition, we hold sales-type/financing leases that are included in ‘Customer and commercial financing, net’. These assets are treated as receivables and allowances are established in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and SFAS No. 118, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan-Income Recognition and Disclosures, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 114. The fair value of aircraft and equipment (on operating lease, held for re-lease and held for sale), and collateral on receivables, is periodically assessed to determine if the fair value is less than the carrying value. Differences between carrying value and fair value are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables and, in certain circumstances, these differences are recorded as asset impairments. To determine the fair value of aircraft, we use the average published value from multiple sources based on the type and age of the aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft to determine fair value, usually when the features or utilization of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. Impairment review for equipment under operating leases, held for re-lease and held for sale We review these assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. An asset under operating lease or held for re-lease is considered impaired when the expected undiscounted cash flow over the remaining useful life is less than the book value. An asset held for sale is considered impaired if the carrying value exceeds the fair value less costs to sell. Various assumptions are used when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including lease rates, lease terms, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the life of the asset. The determination of expected lease rates is generally based on outside publications. We use historical information and current economic trends to determine the remaining assumptions. When impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment loss is the excess of its carrying value over fair value. We estimate that had the fair value of such assets deemed impaired during 2003 been 10% higher or lower at the time each specific impairment had been taken, the impairment expense would have decreased or increased by approximately $11 million. We are unable to predict the magnitude of any future impairments. Allowance for losses on receivables The allowance for losses on receivables (valuation allowance) is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the balance sheet. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivable portfolio. We estimate our valuation allowance on the basis of two components of receivables: (a) specifically identified receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment, and (b) pools of receivables that are evaluated for impairment. A specific receivable is reviewed for impairment when, based on current information and events, we deem it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts that are contractually due to us. Factors 51 Table of Contents considered in assessing uncollectibility include a customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filing for bankruptcy. We record a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral. We review the adequacy of the valuation allowance attributable to the remaining pool of receivables by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value over the applicable collateral value of the related asset. A receivable with an estimated collateral value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. The applicable default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted-average remaining portfolio term. We identify and update credit ratings for each customer in the portfolio, based on current rating agency information or our best estimates. For each credit rating category, the collateral exposure is multiplied by an applicable historical default rate, yielding a credit-adjusted collateral exposure. Historical default rates are published by Standard & Poor’s reflecting both the customer credit rating and the weighted-average remaining portfolio term. The sum of the credit-adjusted collateral exposures generates an initial estimate of the valuation allowance for the pool of receivables. In recognition of the uncertainty of the ultimate loss experience and relatively long duration of the portfolio, a range of reasonably possible outcomes of the portfolio’s credit-adjusted collateral exposure is calculated by varying the applicable default rate by approximately plus and minus 15%. We record a valuation allowance representing our best estimate within the resulting range of credit-adjusted collateral exposures, factoring in considerations of risk of individual credits, current and projected economic and political conditions, and prior loss experience. The resulting range of the credit-adjusted collateral exposure as of December 31, 2003, was approximately $413 million to $510 million. We adjusted the valuation allowance to $452 million at December 31, 2003. Goodwill impairment Because our composition has changed significantly due to various acquisitions, goodwill has historically constituted a significant portion of our long-term assets. We account for our goodwill under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This statement requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill. The SFAS No. 142 goodwill impairment model is a two-step process. First, it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations used in the first step, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. SFAS No. 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually at the same date every year, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. We selected April 1 as our annual testing date. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions, and are subject to review and approval by our senior management and BoD. Changes in these forecasts could cause a particular operating group to either pass or fail the first step in the SFAS No. 142 goodwill impairment model, which could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. 52 Table of Contents The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded. At the date of our previous impairment test, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of our common stock would have had no impact on the impairment charge we recorded in the first quarter of 2003. Postretirement plans We sponsor various pension plans covering substantially all employees. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage, to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. The liabilities and net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). Not all net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and a portion remains in inventory at the end of a reporting period. We use a discount rate that is based on a point-in-time estimate as of our September 30 annual measurement date. This rate is determined based on a review of long-term, high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date and use of models that match projected benefit payments of our major U.S. pension and other postretirement plans to coupons and maturities from high quality bonds. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the 2003 pension and other postretirement liabilities by approximately $1.2 billion (3%) and $218 million (3%), respectively, and decrease the 2003 net periodic pension and other postretirement expense by approximately $25 million and $2 million, respectively. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the 2003 pension and other postretirement liabilities by approximately $1.3 billion (3%) and $244 million (3%), respectively, and increase the 2003 net periodic pension expense by approximately $20 million and decrease the other postretirement expense by approximately $2 million. Net periodic pension costs include an underlying expected long-term rate of asset return. In developing this assumption, we look at a number of factors, including asset class return by several of our trust fund investment advisors, long-term inflation assumptions, and long-term historical returns for our plans. The expected long-term rate of asset return is based on a diversified portfolio including domestic and international equities, fixed income, real estate, private equities and uncorrelated assets. Pension income or expense is especially sensitive to changes in the long-term rate of asset return. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2003 pension income by approximately $75 million. Net periodic costs for other postretirement plans include an assumption of the medical cost trend. To determine the medical trend we look at a combination of information including our future expected medical costs, recent medical costs over the past five years, and general expectations in the industry. The 2003 postretirement benefit obligation for non-pension plans reflects a small increase in medical trend compared to the expected 2003 medical trend used in the 2002 measurement. Recent losses due to higher-than-expected increases in medical claims costs have created an unrecognized loss in 2003. The assumed medical cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A 100 basis point increase in assumed medical cost trend rates would increase the 2003 other postretirement liabilities by approximately $791 million. A 100 basis point decrease in assumed medical cost trend rates would decrease the 2003 other post-retirement liabilities by approximately $691 million. A 100 basis point increase in assumed medical cost trend rates would increase the 2003 other postretirement costs by approximately $78 million. A 100 basis point decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would decrease the 2003 other postretirement costs by approximately $66 million. 53 Table of Contents Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented In January 2004, FASB Staff Position (FSP) No. 106-1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 was issued. FSP No. 106-1 permits the deferral of recognizing the effects of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act) in the accounting for post-retirement health care plan under SFAS No. 106, Employers’ Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, and in providing disclosures related to the plan required by SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers’ Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. The deferral of the accounting for the Act continues to apply until authoritative guidance is issued on the accounting for the federal subsidy provided by the Act or until certain other events requiring plan remeasurement. We have elected the deferral provided by this FSP and are evaluating the magnitude of the potential favorable impact of this FSP on our results of operations and financial position. See Note 15 for further discussion of postretirement benefits. CONTINGENT ITEMS Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts and other matters are pending against us. Most significant legal proceedings are related to matters covered by our insurance. Major contingencies are discussed below. Environmental remediation We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. Due in part to their complexity and pervasiveness, such requirements have resulted in our being involved with related legal proceedings, claims and remediation obligations since the 1980s. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a settlement and of recoveries from insurance carriers. Our policy is to immediately accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites based on estimates of investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred. The costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connection with such activities have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on us. With respect to results of operations, related charges have averaged less than 2% of annual net earnings. Such accruals as of December 31, 2003, without consideration for the related contingent recoveries from insurance carriers, are less than 2% of our total liabilities. Because of the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified contaminated sites and circumstances, the potential exists for environmental remediation costs to be materially different from the estimated costs accrued for identified contaminated sites. However, based on all known facts and expert analyses, we believe it is not reasonably likely that identified environmental contingencies will result in additional costs that would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or to our operating results and cash flow trends. Government investigations We are subject to various U.S. Government investigations, including those related to procurement activities and the alleged possession and misuse of third-party proprietary data, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result. Such proceedings could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on 54 Table of Contents the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, except as set forth below. A-12 litigation In 1991, the U.S. Navy notified McDonnell Douglas (now one of our subsidiaries) and General Dynamics Corporation (the “Team”) that it was terminating for default the Team’s contract for development and initial production of the A-12 aircraft. The Team filed a legal action to contest the Navy’s default termination, to assert its rights to convert the termination to one for “the convenience of the Government,” and to obtain payment for work done and costs incurred on the A-12 contract but not paid to date. As of December 31, 2003, inventories included approximately $583 million of recorded costs on the A-12 contract, against which we have established a loss provision of $350 million. The amount of the provision, which was established in 1990, was based on McDonnell Douglas’s belief, supported by an opinion of outside counsel, that the termination for default would be converted to a termination for convenience, and that the best estimate of possible loss on termination for convenience was $350 million. On August 31, 2001, the U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a decision after trial upholding the U.S. Government’s default termination of the A-12 contract. The court did not, however, enter a money judgment for the U.S. Government on its claim for unliquidated progress payments. In 2003, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, finding that the trial court had applied the wrong legal standard, vacated the trial court’s 2001 decision and ordered the case sent back to that court for further proceedings. This follows an earlier trial court decision in favor of the Team and reversal of that initial decision on appeal. If, after all judicial proceedings have ended, the courts determine contrary to our belief that a termination for default was appropriate, we would incur an additional loss of approximately $275 million, consisting principally of remaining inventory costs and adjustments, and if contrary to our belief the courts further hold that a money judgment should be entered against the Team, we would be required to pay the U.S. Government one-half of the unliquidated progress payments of $1.35 billion plus statutory interest from February 1991 (currently totaling approximately $1.09 billion). In that event our loss would total approximately $1.49 billion in pre-tax charges. However, should the trial court’s 1998 judgment in favor of the Team be reinstated, we would receive approximately $977 million, including interest. We believe, supported by an opinion of outside counsel, that the termination for default are contrary to law and fact and that the loss provision established by McDonnell Douglas in 1990 continues to provide adequately for the reasonably possible reduction in value of A-12 net contracts in process as of December 31, 2003. Final resolution of the A-12 litigation will depend upon the outcome of further proceedings or possible negotiations with the U.S. Government. EELV litigation In 1999, two employees were found to have in their possession certain information pertaining to a competitor, Lockheed Martin Corporation, under the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Program. The employees, one of whom was a former employee of Lockheed Martin Corporation, were terminated and a third employee was disciplined and resigned. In March 2003, the USAF notified us that it was reviewing our present responsibility as a government contractor in connection with the incident. On July 24, 2003, the USAF suspended certain organizations in our space launch services business and the three former employees from receiving government contracts for an indefinite period as a direct result of alleged wrongdoing relating to possession of the Lockheed Martin Corporation information during the EELV source selection in 1998. The USAF also terminated 7 out of 21 of our EELV launches previously awarded through a mutual contract modification and disqualified the launch 55 Table of Contents services business from competing for three additional launches under a follow-on procurement. The same incident is under investigation by the U.S. Attorney in Los Angeles, who indicted two of the former employees in July 2003. In addition, in June 2003, Lockheed Martin Corporation filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida against us and the three individual former employees arising from the same facts. Lockheed’s lawsuit, which includes some 23 causes of action, seeks injunctive relief, compensatory damages in excess of $2 billion, and punitive damages. It is not possible at this time to determine whether an adverse outcome would or could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Shareholder derivative lawsuits In September 2003, two virtually identical shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed in Cook County Circuit Court, Illinois, against us as nominal defendant and against each then current member of our board of directors. The suits allege that the directors breached their fiduciary duties in failing to put in place adequate internal controls and means of supervision to prevent the EELV incident described above, the July 2003 charge against earnings, and various other events that have been cited in the press during 2003. The lawsuits seek an unspecified amount of damages against each director, the return of certain salaries and other remunerations, and the implementation of remedial measures. In October 2003, a third shareholder derivative action was filed against the same defendants in federal court for the Southern District of New York. This third suit charges that our 2003 Proxy Statement contained false and misleading statements concerning the 2003 Incentive Stock Plan. The lawsuit seeks a declaration voiding shareholder approval of the 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, injunctive relief and equitable accounting. It is not possible at this time to determine whether the three shareholder derivative actions would or could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Sears/Druyun investigation and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) investigation On November 24, 2003, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Mike Sears, was dismissed for cause as the result of circumstances surrounding the hiring of Darleen Druyun, a former U.S. government official. Druyun, who had been Vice President and Deputy General Manager of Missile Defense Systems since January 2003, also was dismissed for cause. At the time of our November 24 announcement that we had dismissed the two executives for unethical conduct, we also advised that we had informed the U.S. Air Force of the actions taken and were cooperating with the U.S. Government in its ongoing investigation. The investigation is being conducted by the U.S. Attorney in Alexandria, Virginia, and the Department of Defense Inspector General and concerns this and related matters. Subsequently, the SEC requested information from us regarding the circumstances underlying dismissal of the two employees. We are cooperating with the SEC’s inquiry. It is not possible to predict at this time what actions the government authorities might take with respect to this matter, or whether those actions could or would have a material adverse effect on our financial position. Employment discrimination litigation We are a defendant in seven employment discrimination matters filed during the period of June 1998 through February 2002 in which class certification is sought or has been granted. Three matters are pending in the federal court for the Western District of Washington in Seattle; one case is pending in the federal court for the Central District of California in Los Angeles; one case is pending in the federal court in St. Louis, Missouri; one case is pending in the federal court in Tulsa, Oklahoma; and the final case is pending in the federal court in Wichita, Kansas. The lawsuits seek various forms of relief including front and back pay, overtime, injunctive relief and punitive damages. We intend to continue our aggressive defense of these cases. It is not possible to determine whether these actions could or would have a material adverse effect on our financial position. 56 Table of Contents FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION IS SUBJECT TO RISK AND UNCERTAINTY Certain statements in this report may constitute “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. As a result, these statements speak only as of the date they were made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our actual results and future trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including the continued operation, viability and growth of major airline customers and non-airline customers (such as the U.S. Government); adverse developments in the value of collateral securing customer and other financings; the occurrence of any significant collective bargaining labor dispute; our successful execution of internal performance plans, price escalation, production rate increases and decreases (including any reduction in or termination of an aircraft product), acquisition and divestiture plans, and other cost-reduction and productivity efforts; charges from any future SFAS No. 142 review; an adverse development in rating agency credit ratings or assessments; the actual outcomes of certain pending sales campaigns and U.S. and foreign government procurement activities, including the timing of procurement of tankers by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD); the cyclical nature of some of our businesses; unanticipated financial market changes which may impact pension plan assumptions; domestic and international competition in the defense, space and commercial areas; continued integration of acquired businesses; performance issues with key suppliers, subcontractors and customers; factors that could result in significant and prolonged disruption to air travel worldwide (including future terrorist attacks); any additional impacts from the attacks of September 11, 2001; global trade policies; worldwide political stability; domestic and international economic conditions; price escalation; the outcome of political and legal processes, including uncertainty regarding government funding of certain programs; changing priorities or reductions in the U.S. Government or foreign government defense and space budgets; termination of government or commercial contracts due to unilateral government or customer action or failure to perform; legal, financial and governmental risks related to international transactions; legal proceedings; tax settlements with the IRS; and other economic, political and technological risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained elsewhere in this Form 10-K, principally in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, our Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2003, June 30, 2003 and September 30, 2003. 57 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally short-term investments, fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses due to interest rate changes. Additionally, we use interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Based on the current holdings of short-term investments, as well as related swaps, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material for these instruments. The investors in the fixed-rate debt obligations that we issue, generally do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. BCC’s assets and liabilities, both fixed-rate and floating-rate, may be subject to interest rate risk to the extent that the maturities and repricing characteristics of the liabilities do not perfectly match those of the assets. The types and terms of borrowing and hedging instruments that are available to BCC in the market and possible changes in asset terms limit BCC’s ability to match assets and liabilities. BCC attempts to minimize this risk, partly through the use of interest rate swaps, and does not believe it is materially exposed to gains or losses due to interest rate changes. BCC has used public market information and common valuation methods to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities. The estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts BCC could realize in a current market exchange, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methods could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. At December 31, 2003, the book values of BCC’s assets and liabilities were approximately $12.8 billion and $10.9 billion, respectively. BCC measures and manages its interest rate risk by estimating the potential changes in twelve-month net interest income and in the current discounted value of the assets and liabilities based on the cash flows projected from each. At December 31, 2003, we estimated that if market interest rates for all maturities were affected by an immediate, one-time, 100-basis-point increase, BCC’s net earnings, taking into account increases in both revenue and interest expense, would have changed by an amount that is immaterial to the results of operations. Additionally, although the assets and liabilities impacted by a change in interest rates are generally not traded, BCC estimated that the net present value of these assets and liabilities would have changed by an amount that is immaterial to its financial position. Foreign currency exchange rate risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business and operational financing activities. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2003, a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized loss of $43.5 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. Commodity price risk We are subject to commodity price risk relating principally to energy used in production. We periodically use commodity derivatives, such as fixed-price purchase commitments, to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes of commodities. Commodity price exposure related to unhedged contracts is not material. 58 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:44.078007
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Introduction We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacturing, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and the United States’ second-largest defense contractor. While our principal operations are in the United States, we rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors located around the globe. We operate in six principal segments: Commercial Airplanes; Aircraft and Weapon Systems (A&WS), Network Systems, Support Systems, and Launch and Orbital Systems (L&OS) collectively Integrated Defense Systems (IDS); and Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). All other activities fall within the Other segment, principally made up of Boeing Technology and Connexion by BoeingSM. Our Commercial Airplanes operations primarily involve development, production and marketing of commercial jet aircraft and providing related support services, mainly to the commercial airline industry worldwide. IDS operations principally involve research, development, production, modification and support of the following products and related systems: military aircraft, helicopters and missiles, space systems, missile defense systems, satellites and satellite launching vehicles, rocket engines, and information and battle management systems. BCC is primarily engaged in supporting our major operating units by facilitating, arranging, structuring and/or providing selective financing solutions to our customers and managing overall portfolio risk exposures. Boeing Technology is an advanced research and development organization focused on innovative technologies, improved processes and the creation of new products. Connexion by BoeingSM provides two-way broadband data communications service for global travelers. Effective April 1, 2004, Air Traffic Management was absorbed into Phantom Works research division which is included within Boeing Technology. Financing activities other than those carried out by BCC are also included within the Other segment classification. Our business strategy is centered on running healthy core businesses — Commercial Airplanes and IDS supplemented and supported by BCC. Taken together, these core businesses generate substantial earnings and cash flow to permit us to invest into new products and services and to open new frontiers in aerospace. Our Commercial Airplanes business has been lean and profitable despite severe recent downturn in commercial aviation. We are focused on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. IDS is more than a collection of defense programs that acts as a counterweight to the cyclical commercial airplane business. It is a dynamic business with a strategy to establish ourselves as the leading industry partner to governments in developing an effective defense system against conventional and non-conventional threats. BCC delivers value through supporting our business units and reducing our customer financing exposures. Boeing Technology, our advanced research and development unit, provides new systems, technologies and processes to position us for future growth. Connexion by BoeingSM makes an airplane seem more like the office or home with internet connection at anytime and anywhere. Risk Factors We generally make sales under purchase orders that are subject to cancellation, modification or rescheduling without significant penalties to our customers. Changes in the economic environment and the financial condition of the airline industry or continuing availability of the U.S. congressional appropriations could result in customer requests for rescheduling or cancellation of contractual orders. We depend on a limited number of customers, including the U.S. Government and major commercial airlines. We can make no assurance that any customer will purchase additional products or services from us after our contract with the customer has ended. The loss of a U.S. Government major program 12 Table of Contents or any of the major commercial airlines as customers could significantly reduce our revenues. Several of our commercial airline customers have filed for bankruptcy protection. We are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials and parts and subassemblies from our suppliers. The most important raw materials required for our aerospace products include aluminum and titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions). Although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take a year or more. Many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of domestic and foreign companies. We are dependent upon the ability of our large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards, and delivery schedules at anticipated costs, and their failure to do so could adversely affect production schedules and contract profitability, while jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. We maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties. Sales outside the U.S. (principally export sales from domestic operations) by geographic area are included on page 118. Approximately 2% of total sales were derived from non-U.S. operations for each year ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 and 1% for the year ended December 31, 2002. Approximately 47% of our contractual backlog at December 31, 2004, was with non-U.S. customers compared to 41% at December 31, 2003 and 40% at December 31, 2002. Sales outside the United States are influenced by U.S. Government foreign policy, international relationships, and trade policies of governments worldwide. Relative profitability is not significantly different from that experienced in the domestic market. Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Consolidated Results of Operations The aerospace and defense industry experienced a strong year in 2004. Commercial jetliner deliveries stabilized after two years of steep declines. The U.S. Government continued to increase defense spending and proceeded with the military transformation. On the other hand, we continued to face numerous challenges. Competition from Airbus and regional jet makers intensified as they expand airplane model offerings and competitively price their products. Many airlines, particularly domestic carriers, experienced losses in 2004 negatively impacting new orders for jetliners. Our launch business remained on Air Force suspension and we did not conclude a contract for supplying Tankers to the U.S. Air Force (USAF). Management responded to the challenges by relentlessly focusing on execution of our business strategy and introducing new products and services. During 2004, we successfully launched the 787 with unprecedented customer interest and the 747 Special Freighter and began offering the 777 Freighter. Commercial Airplanes delivered 285 planes as compared to 281 in 2003 and captured 272 net orders, up 14% from 2003. IDS posted a record year in 2004 by delivering double-digit revenue growth and excellent profitability. BCC more than doubled its pre-tax income while Connexion by BoeingSM launched its first commercial services in 2004. The following table summarizes our key indicators of consolidated results of operations for the past three years. (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 52,457 $ 50,256 $ 53,831 Operating Earnings $ 2,007 $ 398 $ 3,426 Operating Margins 3.8 % 0.8 % 6.4 % Net Earnings $ 1,872 $ 718 $ 492 Research and Development $ 1,879 $ 1,651 $ 1,639 Effective Income Tax Rate 7.1 % (37.0 )% 26.9 % Contractual Backlog $ 109,600 $ 104,812 $ 104,173 13 Table of Contents Revenues The increase in 2004 consolidated revenues was driven by strong growth at IDS as its defense and intelligence businesses continued to perform in the healthy markets. IDS revenues grew on increased aircraft deliveries; increased activity in Future Combat Systems (FCS), missile defense, intelligence, airborne command and control programs; and significant increases in supply chain services, life-cycle customer support, and training system and services. Despite increased new aircraft deliveries, Commercial Airplanes revenues declined in 2004. The decline is primarily due to the delivery mix as more single-aisle aircraft and fewer twin-aisle aircraft were delivered in 2004. BCC revenues were down slightly in 2004 due to lower new business volume. (For additional discussion of Commercial Airplanes, IDS and BCC revenues, see pages 29,41 and 50.) Lower consolidated revenues in 2003 compared to 2002 were primarily due to reduced deliveries of our commercial airplanes. The reduced deliveries were the result of the airline industry’s reduced need for additional new aircraft and increased market share of Airbus. The 2003 overall decrease in Commercial Airplane revenues was partially offset by strong performance by IDS and BCC. IDS posted revenue growth across all segments driven by increased deliveries of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAM); increased volume in homeland security, spares and maintenance, and proprietary programs; and the start up of FCS. Operating Earnings Our 2004 operating earnings increased sharply primarily due to the solid performance by IDS. IDS earnings were driven by increased revenue base and improved profitability across all segments. (For detailed discussion of IDS operating earnings please refer to IDS Results of Operation and Financial Condition beginning on page 41.) Commercial Airplanes operating earnings increased slightly as margin improvements and improved period cost performance were partially offset by the negative impact of the change in the model mix and increased research and development costs associated with the 787 program. (See page 30 for additional discussion of Commercial Airplanes operating earnings.) Included in 2004 results is a charge of $555 million related to the USAF 767 tanker program and expenses incurred to end production of the 717 aircraft. $475 million of the charge was recorded by our Commercial Airplanes segment, while $80 million was recorded by IDS (see pages 31 and 38 for additional discussion of the charge). Other significant factors contributing to the 2004 operating earnings compared to 2003 include higher share-based plans expenses, increase in BCC operating earnings, and higher pension expense. The increase in the share-based plans expense in 2004 was attributable to vested and undistributed performance shares. (See Note 17.) For information on BCC operating earnings please refer to page 51. Pension expense is discussed on page 15. Lower operating earnings in 2003 compared to 2002 reflect lower planned commercial airplane deliveries, charges related to the decision to end production of the 757 program, goodwill impairment charges, charges related to the satellite and launch businesses, lower pension income, and an increase in other expenses, as described below. We delivered 100 fewer commercial airplanes in 2003 compared to 2002, and recognized a $184 million charge associated with the decision to end production of the 757 program. We also recognized $913 million in goodwill charges as a result of a goodwill impairment analysis triggered by the reorganization of our Military Aircraft and Missile Systems and Space and Communications segments into IDS; $572 million recorded at IDS and $341 million recorded at the Commercial Airplanes segment. 2003 operating earnings were negatively impacted by a $1,030 million charge related to the satellite and launch businesses (see page 46 for details of the charge). We experienced lower pension income due to declining interest rates and negative pension asset returns in 2001 and 2002, the impact of which is amortized into earnings in future periods. We also incurred higher estimated environmental cleanup costs, increased workers’ compensation claims, and increased legal expense. These factors were partially offset by continued 14 Table of Contents growth and strong operating performance in our portfolio of defense businesses and by continued improvements in operating efficiencies at Commercial Airplanes. We incurred net periodic pension benefit cost of $451 million in 2004 compared to net periodic pension benefit income of $67 million in 2003, and $404 million in 2002. Not all net periodic pension benefit income or cost is recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and a portion remains in inventory at the end of a reporting period. Accordingly, the operating earnings for 2004 included $335 million of pension expense while operating earnings for 2003 and 2002 included $147 million and $526 million of pension income, respectively. The increase in the pension expense was primarily due to higher amortizations of actuarial losses experienced in the last few years. The actuarial losses were created by a combination of decreasing discount rates, which increased the projected benefit obligation, and negative investment earnings in 2001 and 2002, which reduced the market related value of assets. Our pension plan investment returns of 13 percent for the plan year ended September 30, 2004, and 17 percent for the plan year ended September 30, 2003, reflected strong market and plan asset performance. However, over the past five years, the plan returns were lower than expected. Because we expect low interest rates to persist, we anticipate our pension investment returns over the long term to decrease, as reflected in reduction of the expected long-term asset return rate from 9.00 percent in 2003 to 8.75 percent in 2004 and to 8.50 percent in 2005. We also lowered the discount rate from 6.00 percent to 5.75 percent as of September 30, 2004. Net Earnings Our net earnings increased in 2004 due to higher operating earnings partially offset by lower other income and higher income taxes. Additionally, included in 2004 earnings is a $42 million net gain on BCC’s disposal of a substantial portion of its Commercial Financial Services business. The increase in 2003 net earnings over 2002 reflects the federal tax settlement mentioned below, partially offset by lower operating earnings. Other income primarily consists of interest income. Other income in 2004 includes $219 million; of this amount $154 million related to interest income associated with a settlement of federal income tax audits relating to tax years 1983 through 1987 and $65 million related to interest associated with a subsequent settlement for the 1986 through 1997 years. Other income in 2003 increased over 2002 mainly due to the receipt of $397 million of interest income associated with a $1.1 billion partial settlement of federal income tax audits relating to tax years 1992 through 1997. There was no similar interest income in 2002. Also, contributing to lower income in 2002 was $46 million of losses on long-term equity investments. 15 Table of Contents Research and Development Research and development expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative commercial jet aircraft, advance space and other company-sponsored product development. These expenditures are either charged directly against earnings or are included in amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on U.S. Government contracts. In addition, Boeing Technology, our advanced research and development organization, focuses on improving our competitive position by investing in certain technologies and processes that apply to multiple business units. Technology investments currently being pursued within Boeing Technology include network-centric operations, affordable structures and manufacturing technology, lean and efficient design processes and tools, lean support and service initiatives, advanced platform systems and safe and clean products. Research and development expenses were up in 2004 due to increased spending on the 787 program. The expenses are presented net of payments in accordance with sharing arrangements with some suppliers as described on page 34. Research and development expense increased in 2003, principally reflecting IDS’s continued focus on the 767 Global Tanker Transport Aircraft (GTTA) program development as well as the development of communication system architectures in order to support various business opportunities including Future Combat Systems, Joint Tactical Radio System, FAB-T and Global Missile. In 2003, research and development expenses decreased at Commercial Airplanes due to reduced spending on the development of the 747-400ER. Research and development highlights for each of the major business segments are discussed in more detail in Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition on pages 33-34 and 43-47. Income Taxes The 2004 effective income tax rate of 7.1% differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35%, due to Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) and Extraterritorial Income (ETI) exclusion tax benefits, tax credits, state income taxes, tax benefits from a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the years 1986-1997, tax benefits associated with state tax audit settlements, and other provision adjustments. The effective income tax rates of (37.0)% for 2003 and 26.9% for 2002 also vary from the federal statutory tax rate due to FSC and ETI benefits, tax credits, state income taxes, and in 2003, favorable resolution of IRS audit issues and the non-deductibility for tax purposes of certain portions of goodwill impairment charges. IRS Audit Overview IRS examinations have been completed through 1997 and income taxes have been settled with the IRS for all years through 1996 and for McDonnell Douglas Corporation for all years through 1992. We have filed appeals with the IRS for 1993 through 1997 for McDonnell Douglas Corporation. 16 Table of Contents During 2004 we received $896 million relating to federal income tax refunds for which estimated accruals had primarily been recorded in prior periods. Of this amount, $681 million related to the 2003 federal tax return. $104 million related to a settlement of the 1996 tax year and the 1997 partial tax year for McDonnell Douglas Corporation, $69 million related to a settlement of the 1983 through 1987 tax years, and $1 million related to the 1985 tax year. The balance of $41 million relates to a partial settlement of the 1986 through 1997 Boeing Company audit and was recorded in the year ended December 31, 2004. In addition, $217 million of interest income associated with the tax refunds was received and recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operation. Of the $217 million of interest income received, $40 million was recorded in 2003 and the balance was recorded during 2004. In addition to the cash received above, we are awaiting the receipt of an additional $124 million of federal net income tax refund and $42 million of interest for the settlement of the years 1986 through 1997 which have already been accrued during the year ended December 31, 2004. Legislative Update On October 22, 2004, the President signed the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Act). The Act provides a deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, which will be phased in from 2005 through 2010. In return, the Act also provides for a two-year phase-out (except for certain pre-exisitng binding contracts) of the existing ETI exclusion tax benefit for foreign sales which the World Trade Organization (WTO) ruled was an illegal export subsidy. The European Union (EU) believes that the Act fails to adequately repeal the illegal export subsidies because of the transitional provisions and has asked the WTO to review whether these provisions are in compliance with their prior ruling. It is not possible to predict what impact this issue will have on future earnings pending the final resolution of this matter. Additionally, the Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. On December 21, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board Staff Position (FSP) No. FAS 109-1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, was issued. FSP No. FAS 109-1 clarifies that this tax deduction should be accounted for as a special deduction in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. As such, the special deduction has no effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities existing at the date of enactment. Rather, the impact of this deduction will be reported in the period in which the deduction is claimed on our tax return beginning in 2005. As regulations are still pending, we have been unable to quantify this impact. On December 21, 2004, FSP No. FAS 109-2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, was issued. FSP No. FAS 109-2 provides companies additional time, beyond the financial reporting period during which the Act took effect, to evaluate the Act’s impact on a company’s plan for reinvestment or repatriation of certain foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. FSP No. FAS 109-2 was effective upon issuance. As of December 31, 2004, we have not decided on whether and to what extent we might repatriate foreign earnings under the Act, and accordingly, the financial statements do not reflect any provisions for taxes on unremitted foreign earnings. Based on our analysis of the Act, although not yet finalized, it is possible that under the repatriation provision of the Act we may repatriate some amount of earnings between $0 to $350 million with the respective tax liability ranging from $0 to $26 million. We expect to be in a position to finalize our assessment by June 30, 2005. Backlog Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and foreign government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog from 2003 to 2004 primarily relates to new orders for the 17 Table of Contents 787. The increase was partially offset by sales on multi-year contracts that were awarded in prior periods, particulary the C-17 and F/A-18 programs in A&WS, and strong sales on the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program and proprietary programs in Network Systems. The increase in contractual backlog from 2002 to 2003 related to increases in contractual backlog for A&WS and Network Systems, offset by decreases for Commercial Airplanes. A&WS obtained orders for the Apache helicopters from Greece and Kuwait, the F/A-18 E/F Multi Year II contract and the initial funding for the EA-18G from the U.S. Navy while Network Systems obtained orders for the GMD program and Turkey 737 Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) programs coupled with the initial funding of the FCS program. Commercial Airplanes’ decrease in contractual backlog reflects the impact that the economic downturn has had on the airline industry. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and foreign government definitive contracts for which funding has not been appropriated. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2004 is mainly due to strong sales throughout the IDS segments but was partially offset by contract awards for the Multi-Mission Maritime Aircraft (MMA) and FCS program extension and an order from DIRECTV for 3 satellites. For segment reporting purposes, we report Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog for airplanes built and sold to other segments. Commercial Airplanes relieves contractual backlog upon the sale of these airplanes to other segments. IDS contractual backlog includes the modification performed on intracompany airplane purchases from Commercial Airplanes. IDS relieves contractual backlog for the modification performed on airplanes received from Commercial Airplanes upon delivery to the customer or at the attainment of performance milestones. Liquidity and Capital Resources Primary sources of our liquidity and capital resources include cash flow from operations and substantial borrowing capacity through commercial paper programs and long-term capital markets, as well as unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements. The primary factors that affect our investment requirements and liquidity position, other than operating results associated with current sales activity, include the following: timing of new and derivative programs requiring both high developmental expenditures and initial inventory buildup; growth and contractions in business cycles, including growth and expansion requirements and requirements associated with reducing sales levels; customer financing assistance; the timing of federal income tax payments/refunds as well as interest and dividend payments; our stock repurchase plan; internal investments; and potential acquisitions and divestitures. Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Net earnings $ 1,872 $ 718 $ 492 Non-cash items 3,070 3,137 4,357 Changes in working capital (1,484 ) (1,146 ) (2,513 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 3,458 2,709 2,336 Net cash provided (used) by investing activities (1,369 ) 112 (1,382 ) Net cash provided (used) by financing activities (3,518 ) (521 ) 746 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (1,429 ) 2,300 1,700 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 4,633 2,333 633 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 3,204 $ 4,633 $ 2,333 18 Table of Contents Non-cash items Non-cash items in earnings primarily include depreciation, amortization, share-based plans expense, impairments, valuation provisions, and pension expense/income. Non-cash items and corresponding amounts are listed in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Working capital During 2004, our investment in working capital increased. This increase is primarily due to $4.4 billion of discretionary and non-discretionary pension contributions made in 2004 (see discussion following on pensions). Other items primarily contributing to the net increase in investment in working capital include: · an increase in accounts payable, due to normal business operating cycle, principally in our Other operating segment, · a change in income taxes payable related to the tax refunds recorded and tax expense related to current earnings, · cash used by customer financing additions of $1,380 million, offset by customer financing collections of $959 million due to normal customer financing activities, · an increase in advances in excess of related costs due to the recovery of the commercial airplane market, · an increase in cash received from inventories due to lean initiatives. During the third quarter of 2004, we received a federal income tax refund of $681 million cash which resulted from net operating and capital loss carry-backs related to large pension contributions in 2003 and first quarter of 2004. Working capital includes customer financing transactions primarily in the form of notes receivable, sales-type/financing leases and operating leases. These transactions occur as the result of customer related financing activities associated with items recorded in inventory. The origination and subsequent principal collections for these transactions were previously presented as investing activites in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, consistent with the presentation by BCC in their stand alone financial statements. We changed the classification of the cash flow effects of customer financing transactions based on concerns raised by the SEC staff. The amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to be consistent with current year presentation. (See Note 26). For the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, the net impact on operating cash flow was ($421) million, ($1.3) billion, and ($2.0) billion, respectively, for customer financing transactions. Pensions 2004 operating cash flow included $4.4 billion of cash funding to the pension plans. Almost all of the contributions were voluntary to improve the funded status of our plans. On February 4, 2005, we contributed $450 million to the pension plans. Required pension contributions under Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulations are not expected to be material in 2005. However, we are evaluating discretionary contributions of approximately $550 million (pre-tax) later in the year. We expect to contribute approximately $17 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2005. We measure our pension plans using a September 30 year-end for financial accounting purposes. Although in 2004 and 2003, actual investment returns were well in excess of the expected rates of 8.75% and 9.0%, respectively, we reduced our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 25 basis points to 8.5% beginning in 2005 because of general market conditions and changes in the pension plan investment portfolio allocation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on long-term target asset allocations of 50% equity, 31% fixed income, 6% real estate, and 13% other. Current allocations are within 1 to 10% of each of the long-term targets. Historically low interest rates (a key factor when estimating plan liabilities) which have persisted in 2003 and 2004, caused us to recognize an additional non-cash charge to equity in the fourth quarter of 2003. This charge, which 19 Table of Contents resulted in a $358 million increase to the accrued pension plan liability and a $226 million after-tax decrease to the accumulated other comprehensive income account within shareholders’ equity, was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2004. The reversal, which was due in large part to $4.4 billion in pension contributions made during 2004, resulted in a $3.5 billion decrease to the accrued pension liability and a $2.2 billion after-tax increase to the accumulated other comprehensive income account within shareholders’ equity. The charges in 2003 and reversal in 2004, did not impact earnings or cash flow, and will change in future periods as interest rates, market performance, and plan returns vary from expected assumptions. We use a discount rate that is based on a point-in-time estimate as of each annual September 30 measurement date. Although future changes to the discount rate are unknown, had the discount rate increased or decreased by 25 basis points, pension liabilities in total would have decreased $1.3 billion or increased $1.5 billion, respectively. Investing activities In 2004, the amount of cash used for investing activities was approximately $1.5 billion greater than in 2003. A portion of our cash used by investing activities in 2004 was offset by cash of $2 billion generated by the sale of a substantial portion of BCC’s Commercial Financial Services business. Also, additions to Property, Plant, and Equipment in 2004 were approximately $250 million more than 2003 to support the growth of the 787 program and growth of IDS. During 2004, we invested $3.0 billion of cash in an externally managed portfolio of investment grade fixed income instruments. The portfolio is diversified and highly liquid and primarily consists of U.S. dollar debt obligations of the United States Treasury, other government agencies, corporations, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities. The portfolio has an average duration of 1.5 years. Short-term investments are debt securities with maturities less than one year and the remaining securities are long term investments (except cash equivalents with maturities less than 90 days). As of December 31, 2004, amounts invested with a fair value of $2.7 billion were classified as available-for-sale Investments on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. We do not intend to hold these investments to maturity, nor do we intend to actively and frequently buy and sell these securities with the objective of generating profits on short-term differences in price. In addition, amounts totaling $108 million were classified as Cash and cash equivalents and $173 million were classified as available-for-sale and recorded in Short-term investments. During 2004, realized gains and losses on these investments were not material. The majority of BCC’s customer financing is funded by debt and cash flow from its own operation. As of December 31, 2004, we had outstanding irrevocable commitments of approximately $6.7 billion to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order or under option for deliveries scheduled through the year 2007. Not all of these commitments are likely to be used; however, a significant portion of these commitments are with parties with relatively low credit ratings. (See Notes 15 and 20.) Financing activities There were no debt issuances during 2004. In 2003, we received proceeds of $1 billion related to our September 13, 2002 shelf registration. Debt maturities, which include BCC amounts, were $1.1 billion in 2004, $1.8 billion in 2003, and $1.3 billion in 2002. Additionally, BCC issued debt in the amount of $1.0 billion in 2003 and $2.8 billion in 2002. In 2003 and 2002, BCC’s debt issuances were generally used for growth in the customer financing portfolio. On July 26, 2004, BCC redeemed $1 billion face value of its outstanding senior notes, which had a carrying value of $999 million. This redemption included the entire principal amount, equal to $500 million face value, of its 7.10% senior debt securities due 2005 at a redemption price equal to 105.30% of the principal amount of the notes together with interest accrued to the redemption date. BCC redeemed $500 million face value of its 5.65% senior debt securities due 2006 at a redemption price 20 Table of Contents equal to 104.81% of the principal amount of the notes together with interest accrued to the redemption date. BCC recognized a net loss of $42 million related to this early debt redemption. (See Note 15.) There were 14,708,856 shares repurchased at a price of $752 million in our open market share repurchase program, and 50,657 shares repurchased in a stock swap in 2004 and no shares were repurchased in 2003 or 2002. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings are summarized below: Fitch Moody’s Standard &Poor’s Long-term: Boeing/BCC A+ A3 A Short-term: Boeing/BCC F-1 P-2 A-1 Capital Resources We and BCC each have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. As of December 31, 2004, neither we nor BCC had any outstanding commercial paper issuances. We have substantial borrowing capacity. Currently, $3.4 billion remains available to BCC from shelf registrations filed with the SEC and $3.5 billion ($2.0 billion exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements with a group of major banks remains available. (See Note 15). We believe our internally generated liquidity, together with access to external capital resources, will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. On March 23, 2004, we filed a shelf registration with the SEC for $1 billion for the issuance of debt securities and underlying common stock. In November 2004, we rolled over the 364-day revolving credit facility, reducing it from $2.5 billion to $2.0 billion. Prior to November we had $1.25 billion assigned to BCC and $1.25 billion assigned to us. Currently, there is $1.25 billion assigned to BCC with only $750 million assigned to us. There was no change to the 5-year credit facility of $1.5 billion, of which $750 million remains assigned to BCC, we established in November 2003. As of December 31, 2004, we are in compliance with the covenants for the 364-day and the 5-year revolving credit facilities. 21 Table of Contents Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2004, as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied. Contractual obligations (Dollars in millions) Total Less than1 year 1–3years 3–5years After 5years Long-term debt $ 11,884 $ 1,250 $ 3,181 $ 514 $ 6,939 Capital lease obligations 316 71 152 32 61 Operating lease obligations 2,284 390 665 364 865 Purchase obligations: Not recorded on statement of financial position Production related 44,676 20,981 16,192 6,381 1,122 Pension and other post retirement cash requirements 2,985 537 1,174 1,274 Recorded on statement of financial position 6,953 5,718 319 328 588 Total contractual obligations $ 69,098 $ 28,947 $ 21,683 $ 8,893 $ 9,575 Purchase obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, the agreements are not cancelable without a substantial penalty. Long-term debt, capital leases, and operating leases are shown in the above table regardless of whether they meet the characteristics of purchase obligations. Purchase obligations include both amounts that are and are not recorded on the statements of financial position. Approximately 23% of the purchase obligation amounts disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase obligations – not recorded on the statement of financial position. Pension and other postretirement benefits Pension funding is an estimate of our minimum funding requirements through 2006 to provide pension benefits for employees based on service provided through 2004 pursuant to the ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Obligations relating to other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments, since the majority of our other postretirement benefits are not funded through a trust, and the estimated contribution to the one plan that is funded through a trust through 2009. Our estimate may change significantly depending on the actual rate of return on plan assets, discount rates, discretionary pension contributions, regulatory rules, and medical trends. Production related Production related purchase obligations include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises due to the extended production planning horizon for many of our products, including commercial aircraft, military aircraft and other products where delivery to the customer occurs over an extended period of time. A significant portion of these inventory commitments are either supported by firm contracts from 22 Table of Contents customers, or have historically resulted in settlement through either termination payments or contract adjustments should the customer base not materialize to support delivery from the supplier. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Industrial participation agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers in foreign countries to effect economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies, as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work, placement of vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology, or other forms of assistance to the foreign country. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our foreign customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2004, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2004, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $7.4 billion that extend through 2015. In cases where we satisfy our commitments through the purchase of supplies and the criteria described in “purchase obligations” is met, amounts are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, the foreign country or customer must have sufficient capability and capacity and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Purchase obligations recorded on the statement of financial position Purchase obligations recorded on the statement of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees and variable interests in unconsolidated entities. Guarantees The following tables provide quantitative data regarding our third-party guarantees. The maximum potential payment amounts represent “worst-case scenarios” and do not necessarily reflect our expected results. Estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse represent the anticipated values of assets we could liquidate or receive from other parties to offset our payments under guarantees. The carrying amount of liabilities recorded on the balance sheet reflects our best estimate of future payments we may incur as part of fulfilling our guarantee obligations. As of December 31, 2004 MaximumPotentialPayments EstimatedProceedsfromCollateral/Recourse CarryingAmount ofLiabilities* Contingent repurchase commitments $ 3,751 $ 3,743 Trade-in commitments 972 947 $ 25 Asset-related guarantees 408 296 12 Credit guarantees related to the Sea Launch venture 510 306 204 Other credit guarantees 60 19 10 Equipment trust certificates 28 Performance guarantees 64 21 1 23 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2003 MaximumPotentialPayments EstimatedProceedsfromCollateral/Recourse CarryingAmount ofLiabilities* Contingent repurchase commitments $ 5,712 $ 5,712 Trade-in commitments 1,279 1,214 $ 65 Asset-related guarantees 468 364 5 Credit guarantees related to the Sea Launch venture 519 311 208 Other credit guarantees 106 50 5 Equipment trust certificates 28 Performance guarantees 56 18 * Amounts included in accounts payable and other liabilities In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into specified-price trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft for the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price at a future point in time, generally ten years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If, in the future, we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Contingent repurchase commitments and trade-in commitments are now included in our guarantees discussion based on our current analysis of the underlying transactions. Based on our historical experience, we believe that very few, if any, of our outstanding contingent repurchase commitments will ultimately become trade-in commitments. During 2004, we recorded no expense and made no net cash payments related to our contingent repurchase commitments. Exposure related to the trade-in of used aircraft resulting from trade-in commitments may take the form of: (1) adjustments to revenue related to the sale of new aircraft determined at the signing of a definitive agreement, and/or (2) charges to cost of products and services related to adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for new aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. The trade-in aircraft exposure included in accounts payable and other liabilities in the tables above is related to item (2) above. There is a high degree of uncertainty inherent in the assessment of the likelihood of trade-in commitments. The probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources and is continually assessed by management. As disclosed in the above table, the maximum amounts payable under trade-in commitments were $972 million and $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. Based on the best market information available at the time, it was probable that we would be obligated to perform on trade-in commitments with gross amounts payable to customers totaling $116 million and $582 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. The estimated fair value of trade-in aircraft related to probable contractual trade-in commitments was $91 million and $517 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003. Accounts payable and other liabilities included $25 million and $65 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, which represents the exposure related to these trade-in commitments. We have issued various asset-related guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale of certain commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event the related aircraft fair values fall below a specified amount at a future point in time. No aircraft have been delivered with these types of guarantees in several years. During 2004, we recorded no expense and made no net cash payments related to our asset-related guarantees. 24 Table of Contents We have previously issued credit guarantees to creditors of the Sea Launch venture, of which we are a 40% partner, to assist the venture in obtaining financing. In the event we are required to perform on these guarantees, we have the right to recover a portion of the loss from other venture partners and have collateral rights to certain assets of the venture. In addition, we have issued other credit guarantees to facilitate the sale of certain commercial aircraft. Under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original debtor or lessee. Our commercial aircraft credit-related guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft. A substantial portion of these guarantees have been extended on behalf of original debtors or lessees with less than investment-grade credit. Recent financial weakness in certain airlines further exposes us to loss under our credit guarantees. During 2004, we recorded expense of $1 million and made no net cash payments related to our credit guarantees. We had certain obligations to investors in the trusts as a liquidity provider for Equipment Trust Certificates (ETC) pass-through arrangements, which required funding to the trust to cover interest due to such investors in the event of default by United Airlines, Inc. (United). In the event of funding, we are entitled to receive a first priority position in the ETC collateral in the amount of the funding. On February 7, 2003, we advanced $101 million to the trust perfecting our collateral position and terminating our liquidity obligation. On August 9, 2004, The Bank of New York, acting as the collateral agent, reimbursed us for this advance with a total payment of $107 million. The payment included the original advanced amount, as well as interest income related to the advance. Also relating to an ETC investment, we have potential obligations relating to shortfall interest payments in the event that the interest rates in the underlying agreements are reset below a certain level. These obligations would cease if United were to default on our interest payments to the trust. There were no significant payments made by us during 2004. We have outstanding performance guarantees issued in conjunction with joint venture investments. Pursuant to these guarantees, we would be required to make payments in the event a third-party fails to perform specified services. We have made no significant payments in relation to these performance guarantees. Material variable interests in unconsolidated entities Our investments in ETCs, Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificates (EETCs) and Special Purpose Entities (SPEs) are included in the scope of Revised Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46 (R)), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. All entities that were required to be consolidated under FIN 46(R) had been previously consolidated, and therefore, the adoption of FIN 46(R) had no impact on our consolidated financial statements. From 1999 through 2004, we invested in ETCs and EETCs, which are trusts that passively hold debt investments for a large number of aircraft to enhance liquidity for investors, who in turn pass this liquidity benefit directly to airlines in the form of lower coupon and/or greater debt capacity. ETCs and EETCs provide investors with tranched rights to cash flows from a financial instrument, as well as a collateral position in the related asset. Our investment in ETCs and EETCs do not require consolidation under FIN 46(R). We believe that our maximum exposure to economic loss from ETCs and EETCs is $349 million, comprised of our $321 million investment balance and a maximum potential exposure of $28 million relating to potential shortfall interest payments. Accounting losses, if any, from period to period could differ. As of December 31, 2004, the ETC and EETC transactions we participated in had total assets of $3.9 billion and total debt (which is non-recourse to us) of $3.6 billion. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded revenues of $28 million and cash flows of $70 million. From 1998 through 2004, we provided subordinated loans to certain SPEs that are utilized by the airlines, lenders and loan guarantors, including, for example, the Export-Import Bank of the United States. All of these SPEs are included in the scope of FIN 46(R); however, only certain SPEs require 25 Table of Contents consolidation. SPE arrangements are utilized to isolate individual transactions for legal liability or tax purposes, or to perfect security interests from our perspective, as well as, in some cases, that of a third-party lender in certain leveraged lease transactions. We believe that our maximum exposure to economic loss from non-consolidated SPE arrangements that are Variable Interest Entities (VIE) is $43 million, which represents our investment balance. Accounting losses, if any, from period to period could differ. As of December 31, 2004, these SPE arrangements had total assets of $451 million and total debt (which is non-recourse to us) of $408 million. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we recorded revenues of $3 million and cash flows of $28 million. Commercial commitments The following tables summarize our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2004, as well as an estimate of the timing in which these commitments are expected to expire. (Dollars in millions) Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $ 3,183 $ 2,866 $ 152 $ 34 $ 131 Other commercial commitments 6,661 495 3,755 2,321 90 Total commercial commitments $ 9,844 $ 3,361 $ 3,907 $ 2,355 $ 221 Related to the issuance of certain standby letters of credit and surety bonds included in the above table, we received advance payments of $1.8 billion and $1.0 billion as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Other commercial commitments include irrevocable financing commitments related to aircraft on order and commercial equipment financing. (See Note 20.) Industrial Revenue Bonds We utilize Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our Wichita site. Tax benefits associated with IRBs include a provision for a ten-year property tax abatement and a sales tax exemption from the Kansas Department of Revenue. We record the property on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, along with capital lease obligation to repay the proceeds of the IRB. We have also purchased the IRBs and therefore we are the Bondholder as well as the Borrower/ Lessee of the property purchased with the IRB proceeds. We also have a similar arrangement in place with the Development Authority of Fulton County, Georgia where we are both borrower and bondholder. Tax benefits associated with these IRBs are the provision of a ten-year partial property tax abatement. The capital lease obligation and IRB asset are recorded net in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position pursuant to FIN 39, Offsetting of Amounts Related to Certain Contracts. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the assets and liabilities associated with the City of Wichita IRBs were $2.9 billion, and the amounts associated with the Fulton County IRBs were $19 million. Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment World-wide air travel experienced a strong rebound in 2004. This rebound is notable in that it represents a recovery from the levels of 2003 which were depressed by the 26 Table of Contents Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Asia, and represents a traffic level that exceeds the previous record which was set in 2000. It has taken the industry four years to exceed that level, indicating the difficulties faced by the world’s airlines as they have dealt with the effects of recession, terrorism, and disease. This traffic volume has been driven by strong world-wide economic growth which stimulates demand, and declining real airline yields which makes air travel more affordable to more people. This increase in demand has produced high load factors, but not industry-wide profitability due to a significant increase in the price of jet fuel. The world’s airlines have made great strides in cost efficiency, only to see those improvements be more than offset by price increases of jet fuel. The world-wide increases in the price of crude oil that began in mid 2003 and peaked in late 2004 have contributed to world airline losses that are estimated to be about $5 billion dollars in 2004 and represent the fourth consecutive year of losses for the world’s airlines. This large industry loss does not mean that all airlines are losing money in the current environment. We are seeing divergence in the profitability of different types of airlines as their different business models are proving to be vulnerable or robust to these environmental changes. The hardest-hit have been the large U.S. network carriers. These airlines were the most damaged by the results of the 2001 terrorist attacks on the United States and have been the most vulnerable to increasing competition and technology changes that are changing the air travel business. The large network airlines outside the United States have been more successful in dealing with the challenges of 2004, most are profitable despite current fuel prices, and they continue to order new airplanes. The airlines that have fared best are the low-cost, low-fare airlines. They have been consistently profitable throughout the current challenges and their continued growth represents a real change in the air travel market. These airlines also continue to order and to take delivery of new airplanes. Further recovery in profitability for the world’s airlines is highly dependent on the future movement in oil and fuel prices; as these prices fall the prospects of the world’s airlines will improve. As profitability improves and air travel demand continues to increase with increasing economic activity, we see an improvement in the prospects for future airplane orders and deliveries. Our 20-year forecast of the average long-term growth rate of passenger traffic is 5.2% per annum, and 6.2% per annum for cargo traffic based on projected average annual worldwide real economic growth of 3.0%. Based on global economic growth projections over the long term, and taking into consideration an increasingly competitive environment, increasing utilization levels of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $2.0 trillion market for 25,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. This is a long-term forecast; historically, while factors such as the Gulf War and increased ticket charges for security have had significant impact over the span of several years, they have not dramatically affected the longer-term trends in the world economy, and therefore, our market outlook. Inherent Business Risks Commercial jet aircraft are normally sold on a firm fixed-price basis with an indexed price escalation clause. Our ability to deliver jet aircraft on schedule is dependent upon a variety of factors, including execution of internal performance plans, availability of raw materials, performance of suppliers and subcontractors, and regulatory certification. The introduction of new commercial aircraft programs and major derivatives involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. The worldwide market for commercial jet aircraft is predominately driven by long-term trends in airline passenger traffic. The principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth, both in developed and emerging countries and political stability. Demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline industry profitability, world trade policies, government-to- 27 Table of Contents government relations, environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operations, technological changes, and price and other competitive factors. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long-term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has continued to enable low-cost airlines to gain market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 2/3 of Commercial Airplanes’ third-party sales and contractual backlog are from customers based outside the United States. We face aggressive international competitors that are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. The recent decline of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies is putting unusual pressure on their future revenues and profits. While this may seem like an advantage to us, it contains a potential threat in that competitors may react by aggressively reducing costs, potentially improving their longer-term competitive posture. Airbus has indicated that they are adopting this approach, and plan more than 10% reduction in costs by 2006. If the dollar strengthens by then, Airbus could use the extra efficiency to gain market share and develop new products. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network for airlines throughout the world to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively and maintain satisfactory margins. While we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction activities, events may occur that will prevent us from achieving planned results. We continue to explore strategic options related to our operations at various sites to focus on large-scale systems integration, which is where we are most competitive and can add the most value to our airplanes and services. These sites include but are not limited to Wichita, Tulsa and McAlester. (See Note 27.) Summary Air travel continues to be the safest, most cost-effective form of travel ever invented. Modern air travel is essential to world-wide economic development, contributing to, and benefiting from increasing global trade. Recent signs of recovery and the continued expectation for long-term growth in air travel are encouraging. The airline industry continues to evolve in a challenging environment. Successful airlines with robust business models are continuing to grow and will need new airplanes to accommodate that growth as well as to maintain modern, cost-effective fleets. We will continue to evolve as well, providing airplanes and services that are recognized as providing the most capable and productive solutions to the airlines’ business requirements. 28 Table of Contents Operating Results (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 21,037 $ 22,408 $ 28,387 % of Total Company Revenues 40 % 44 % 53 % Operating Earnings $ 753 $ 707 $ 2,017 Operating Margins 3.6 % 3.2 % 7.1 % Research and Development $ 941 $ 676 $ 768 Contractual Backlog $ 70,449 $ 63,929 $ 68,159 Revenues Commercial Airplanes revenue is derived primarily from commercial jet aircraft deliveries. New commercial jet aircraft deliveries were higher in 2004 compared to 2003, but the delivery mix included more single-aisle aircraft and fewer twin-aisle aircraft. The decline in revenue of $1.4 billion in 2004 from 2003 was primarily attributable to new airplane model mix of $1.2 billion and net reduction of $132 million in other products. The decline in revenue in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the decline in the commercial aviation market which resulted in fewer commercial jet aircraft deliveries. Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31, including deliveries under operating lease, which are identified by parentheses, were as follows: Model 2004 2003 2002 717 12 (6) 12 (11) 20 737 Next-Generation* 202 173 223 (2) 747 15 19 (1) 27 (1) 757 11 14 29 767 9 (1) 24 (5) 35 (1) 777 36 39 47 Total 285 281 381 * Deliveries in 2004 included intracompany deliveries of three 737 Next-Generation aircraft (two USNR C40A aircraft and one Project Wedgetail AEW&C System aircraft). Deliveries in 2003 included intra-company deliveries of three 737 Next-Generation aircraft (two C-40 aircraft and one AEW&C System aircraft). Deliveries in 2002 included intracompany deliveries of four 737 Next-Generation aircraft (three C-40 aircraft and one AEW&C System aircraft). The cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: Model 2004 2003 2002 717 137 125 113 737 Next-Generation 1,622 1,420 1,247 747 1,353 1,338 1,319 757 1,047 1,036 1,022 767 925 916 892 777 499 463 424 29 Table of Contents The undelivered units under firm order* as of December 31 were as follows: Model 2004 2003 2002 717 18 22 26 737 Next-Generation 771 800 765 747 27 32 52 757 2 13 28 767 25 25 39 777 167 159 173 787 52 * Firm orders represent new aircraft purchase agreements where the customers’ rights to cancel without penalty have expired. Typical customer rights to cancel without penalty include the customer receiving approval from its Board of Directors, shareholders, government and completing financing arrangements. All such cancellation rights must be satisfied or expired even if satisfying such conditions are highly certain. Firm orders exclude option aircraft and aircraft subject to reconfirmation. Operating earnings The increase of $46 million in operating earnings in 2004 from 2003 was primarily attributable to $466 million from improved program margins due to cost reduction initiatives and decreased period costs offset by lower earnings from the change in model mix of $205 million, 717 program termination charge of $280 million, 767 USAF Tanker program charge of $195 million and increased research and development expense of $265 million. Additionally, in 2003 we had a goodwill impairment charge of $341 million and a charge of $184 million resulting from the decision to end production of the 757 program. The decline in operating earnings in 2003 compared to 2002 was primarily due to the reduction in revenue as a result of lower delivery volume, a goodwill impairment charge of $341 million, a $184 million charge resulting from the decision to end production of the 757 program, and increased pension expense, all of which was partially offset by improved operating efficiency and reduced research and development expense. Backlog Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and foreign government contract funding. The increase in backlog in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily relates to new orders for the 777 and 787. The decline in backlog in 2003 compared to 2002 represents higher delivery volume on all airplane programs relative to new orders. Unobligated backlog increased by approximately $0.6 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004. This increase is attributed to the MMA program contract award. There was no unobligated backlog as of December 31, 2003. For each airplane program, we estimate the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. We refer to this estimate as the “accounting quantity.” The accounting quantity for each program is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout the life of a program. See “Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Program accounting.” Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. We review and reassess our program accounting quantities on a quarterly basis in compliance with relevant program accounting guidance. Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which do not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity increases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also increases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates, thus reducing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. 30 Table of Contents The estimate of total program accounting quantities and changes, if any, as of December 31 were: 717 737 Next-Generation 747 757 767 777 2004 156 2,400 1,400 1,050 959 700 Additions/(deletions) 8 200 12 (16 ) 50 2003 148 2,200 1,388 1,050 975 650 Additions/(deletions) 8 200 (13 ) (50 ) (25 ) 50 2002 140 2,000 1,401 1,100 1,000 600 717 Program The accounting quantity for the 717 program has been based on firm orders since the fourth quarter of 2001. The 717 program accounting quantity was increased during 2004 due to the program obtaining additional firm orders. As of December 31, 2004, of the 18 remaining undelivered units, 8 units will be delivered to a single customer with uncertain financial condition. As a result, on a consolidated basis, these aircraft are accounted for as long-term operating leases as they are delivered. The value of the inventory for the undelivered aircraft as of December 31, 2004, remained realizable. Program continuity at the end of the third quarter of 2004 was dependent on the outcome of current sales campaigns. During the nine months ended September 30, 2004 firm orders for six additional units had been received and during November 2004, firm orders for two additional units had been received. On January 12, 2005, we decided to conclude production of the 717 commercial airplane in 2006 due to the lack of overall market demand for the airplane. The decision is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $385 million, of which $280 million is incorporated in the 2004 fourth quarter and year end results. Of the $280 million charge that was incorporated in the 2004 fourth quarter and year end results, supplier termination charges are estimated to be $171 million; production disruption and related charges are estimated to be $36 million; pension/post-retirement curtailment charges are estimated to be $43 million; and severance charges are estimated to be $30 million. Of the $105 million charge that is expected to be recorded in periods subsequent to 2004, pension settlement charges are estimated to be $60 million and plant shutdown charges are estimated to be $45 million. The termination of the 717 line will result in $385 million of cash expenditures that are expected to occur during 2005 through 2007. This charge is determined based on current facts and information and we will revise our estimates accordingly as new facts and information become available. 737 Next-Generation and 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 Next-Generation and 777 programs were increased during 2004 as a result of the programs’ normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. 747 Program The 747 program accounting quantity was increased during 2004 as a result of additional orders received since 2003. We are continuing to monitor the commercial market for the 747 and potential new derivatives. The future of the program largely depends on market acceptance of new derivatives. Due to the uncertainty of the market acceptance, completion of production is reasonably possible. A forward loss is not expected as a result of a decision to complete production but program margins would be modestly impacted. Additionally, completion of production may create excess spares inventory, resulting in a charge that is not expected to be material. A decision to proceed with a new derivative or complete production is likely to be made mid-year 2005. 757 Program Due to lack of demand for the 757 program, a decision was made in the third quarter of 2003 to end production of the program. Production of the 757 program ended in October 2004. There are two remaining aircraft that will be delivered in the first half of 2005. 31 Table of Contents In 2003, the 757 program charge of $184 million included $15 million of spares inventory writedown and $169 million forward loss. The forward loss was comprised of $111 million in vendor termination charges and $58 million due to the requirement to allocate incurred inventory costs over a reduced quantity of 757 airplane deliveries. Other than an estimated $17 million of tooling disposition and plant clean-up costs, which will be expensed as incurred, no future charges related to the 757 airplane program are expected. However, we will continue to monitor the total estimated cost of sales and total estimated revenues for the remaining program, and will revise our estimates accordingly as new facts and information become available. 767 Program Based on the regular quarter and year-end reviews, our updated assessment of securing the specific USAF 767 Tanker contract resulted in the decision that the pre-contract costs should no longer be deferred, given the continued delay and now likely recompetition of the contract. Commercial Airplanes’ portion of the charge was $195 million consisting of $125 million of incurred development and tooling costs, $54 million of spending, net of scrap value, for production of a partially complete USAF Tanker, and $16 million of supplier termination liability. The decrease in the 767 program accounting quantity during 2004 was due to the removal of anticipated future 767 Tanker deliveries to the USAF. The long term viability of the 767 program is dependent on receiving a timely USAF Tanker contract. We will be closely monitoring the future market for the 767. Due to the uncertainty, production completion is reasonably possible. A forward loss is not expected as a result of this decision but program margins would be significantly impacted. Additionally, completion of production may create excess spares inventory, resulting in a charge that is not expected to be material. A decision to complete production is likely to be made mid-year 2005. We continue to actively market the 767 program to commercial customers and position the program to support a USAF 767 Tanker contract and other military applications. (See IDS 767 Tanker Program on page 38 for further discussion.) The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be addressed. The percentage of anticipated orders included in the program accounting estimates as compared to the number of cumulative firm orders* as of December 31 were as follows: 717 737 Next- Generation 747 757 767 777 2004 Cumulative firm orders (CFO) 155 2,393 1,380 1,049 950 666 Anticipated orders N/A 5 19 N/A 6 34 Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A 0 % 1 % N/A 1 % 5 % 2003 Cumulative firm orders 147 2,220 1,370 1,049 941 622 Anticipated orders N/A N/A 17 N/A 32 28 Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A 1 % N/A 3 % 5 % 2002 Cumulative firm orders 139 2,012 1,371 1,050 931 597 Anticipated orders 0 N/A 29 49 67 3 Anticipated orders as a % of CFO 0 % N/A 2 % 5 % 7 % 1 % * Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries (see table in Commercial Airplanes Revenues discussion) plus undelivered units under firm order (see table in Commercial Airplanes Revenues discussion). Cumulative firm orders include orders that fall within the current accounting quantities as well as orders that extend beyond the current accounting quantities. Cumulative firm orders exclude program test aircraft that will not be refurbished for sale. 32 Table of Contents Deferred production costs Commercial aircraft inventory production costs incurred on in-process and delivered units in excess of the estimated average cost of such units, determined as described in Note 1 represent deferred production costs. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, there were no significant excess deferred production costs or unamortized tooling costs not recoverable from existing firm orders for the 777 program. The deferred production costs and unamortized tooling included in the 777 program’s inventory at December 31 are summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 Deferred production costs $ 703 $ 794 Unamortized tooling 485 582 As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, the balance of deferred production costs and unamortized tooling related to all other commercial aircraft programs was insignificant relative to the programs’ balance-to-go cost estimates. Fleet support We provide the operators of all our commercial airplane models assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals and technical consulting support, and continues throughout the operational life of the aircraft. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model’s fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. Research and development We continually evaluate opportunities to improve current aircraft models, and assess the marketplace to ensure that our family of commercial jet aircraft is well positioned to meet future requirements of the airline industry. The fundamental strategy is to maintain a broad product line that is responsive to changing market conditions by maximizing commonality among our family of commercial aircraft. Additionally, we are determined to continue to lead the industry in customer satisfaction by offering products with the highest standards of quality, safety, technical excellence, economic performance and in-service support. The increase in 2004 research and development compared to 2003 was primarily due to increased spending on the 787. The decrease in 2003 research and development compared to 2002 was primarily due to reduced spending on the development of the 747-400ER. The initial delivery of the 747-400ER and the rollout of the first 777-300ER occurred in the fourth quarter of 2002. The initial delivery of the 777-300ER occurred during the first half of 2004. We are currently focusing our new airplane product development efforts on the 787 program, which with the three planned versions will seat 223 to 296 passengers in multiple class configurations. In early 2004, we received the initial launch order for the 787 and Board of Directors (BoD) approval to proceed with full development and production. Entry into service is targeted for 2008. We project a continued increase in our research and development spending in 2005, primarily driven by spending on the 787 while we also continue to develop derivatives and features for our other programs primarily the 33 Table of Contents 737, 747-400 Special Freighter modification and 777 programs. Commercial Airplanes’ development work to support the MMA contract with the U.S. Navy is being deferred as part of the contract costs and is not reflected as research and development. During 2004, we established cost sharing arrangements with some suppliers for the 787 that will enhance our internal development capabilities and offset a substantial portion of the financial risk of developing the 787 product. Amounts received from these suppliers will reduce our research and development expense related to the 787, since we will have no obligation to refund any amounts earned per the arrangements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. Our cost sharing arrangements explicitly state that the supplier contributions are for reimbursements of costs we incur for experimentation, basic design and testing activities during the development of the 787. In each arrangement, we will retain the same rights that have been available under traditional supplier arrangements on past airplane programs. For 2004, 787 supplier development cost sharing payments earned were $205 million. The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Integrated Defense Systems Business Environment and Trends IDS is comprised of four reportable segments, which include A&WS, Network Systems, Support Systems and L&OS. The IDS business environment extends over multiple markets, including defense (A&WS, Network Systems and Support Systems segments), homeland security (Network Systems), civil space transportation and exploration (L&OS), and launch and satellites (L&OS). IDS derives over 85% of its revenue from sales to the U.S. Government and we are forecasting this business mix will remain at this level into the foreseeable future. Specifically, the primary customers of IDS are the DoD for our products in the defense market, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security for the homeland security market, NASA for the civil space transportation and exploration market, and the U.S. Government and commercial satellite service providers for the launch and satellite market. Since the trends associated with these markets impact IDS opportunities and risks in unique ways, the various environmental factors for each are discussed individually below. Defense environment overview The U.S. DoD represents nearly 50% of the world’s defense budget. The current defense environment is characterized by transformation and change in the face of shrinking force structure, aging platforms, and levels of operations and engagements worldwide that are expected to remain high for the foreseeable future. The current environment is also heavily influenced by the continuing war on terrorism and the need to bring new technologies to assist the war fighter. The United States’ leadership in the global war on terrorism demonstrates the value of 34 Table of Contents networked intelligence, surveillance and communications, interoperability across platforms, services and forces, and the leveraging effects of precise, persistent, and selective engagement. The significance and advantage of unmanned systems to perform many of these tasks is growing. These experiences are driving the DoD, along with militaries worldwide, to transform their forces and the way they operate. Network-centric operations are at the heart of this transformation. There will continue to be pressure between this transformation goal and the support required for the existing forces. The 2005 DoD authorization was approved in the fourth quarter of 2004 at a total level of $402 billion, including supplementals. Supplementals are the additional funds that are requested by the DoD to cover extraordinary events that were not planned for in the usual budget cycle. Although under pressure, the DoD budget remains strong and focused on transformation. This will provide opportunities for IDS products in the future. However, with a struggling global economy and anticipated federal budget deficits, allocations to DoD procurement decreased between fiscal year 2004 and 2005, and will remain under pressure in the near future. This suggests that the DoD will continue to focus on affordability strategies emphasizing network-centric operations, joint interoperability, long-range strike, unmanned air combat and reconnaissance vehicles, precision guided weapons and continued privatization of logistics and support activities as a means to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. Along with this, we are already seeing the need for the military to make difficult choices between programs in an effort to support their highest priority. Programs will be continually evaluated with program performance and relevancy to the overall DoD vision as the measures for continuation or cancellation. Military transformation The defense transformation is evidenced by a trend toward smaller, more capable, interoperable, and technologically advanced forces. To achieve these capabilities, a transformation in acquisition is underway with an increasing trend toward early deployment of initial program capabilities followed by subsequent incremental improvements (referred to as spiral development), cooperative international development programs and a demonstrated willingness to explore new forms of development, acquisition and support. Along with these trends, new system procurements are being evaluated for the degree to which they support the concept of jointness and interoper-ability among the services. Institutions and events continue to shape the defense industrial environment. The DoD’s implementation of a new Joint Capabilities Integration and Development Systems organization and process, along with revisions to the Defense Acquisition System, Program Planning Budgeting and Execution processes and the establishment of the Office of Force Transformation, has created a durable institutional foundation for continued transformation. Operations in the continuing global war on terrorism reaffirm the need for the rapid projection of decisive combat power around the world and emphasize the need for new capabilities and solutions for the war fighter. They also highlight the need for improved logistics and stability operation capabilities at completion of hostilities. Toward that end, the DoD is fully committed to a transformation that will achieve and maintain advantages through changes in operational concepts, organizational structure and technologies that significantly improve war fighting capabilities. Missile Defense Funding for the missile defense market is primarily driven by the U.S. Government Missile Defense Agency (MDA) budget. The primary thrusts in this market are the continued development and deployment of theater missile defense systems and the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) program. The overall MDA missile defense budget for 2004 was approximately $9 billion and appropriations for 2005 are about $10 billion. With the Administration trying to curb the rise in defense spending it appears the MDA’s budget will begin to come under pressure. That said we feel the GMD program has continued to make great progress over the past year in meeting President Bush’s call to deploy a capability by the end of 2004. We believe this program, which is the cornerstone of our Missile Defense business, will be supported. Through our leadership position on the 35 Table of Contents Missile Defense National Team and our prime contractor role on the GMD segment program and on the Airborne Laser program, IDS is positioned to maintain its role as the MDA’s number one contractor. Defense Competitive Environment The global competitive environment continues to intensify, with increased focus on the U.S. defense market, the world’s largest and most attractive. IDS faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. Foreign companies such as BAE Systems and EADS continue to build a strategic presence in the U.S. market by strengthening their North American operations and partnering with U.S. defense companies. We expect industry consolidation, partnering, and market concentration to continue. Prime contractors will continue to partner or serve as major suppliers to each other on various programs and will perform targeted acquisitions to fill technology or customer gaps. At the lower tiers, consolidation persists and select companies have been positioning for larger roles, especially in the aerospace support market. Homeland Security Environment The Department of Homeland Security became official in 2003, a year characterized by significant U.S. Government transformational and organizational challenges. Organizational alignment is ongoing and procurement practices are evolving. It is important to realize that this department has been formed from existing agencies and their budgets, and therefore a large portion of the near-term budget is committed to heritage programs and staffing. Until some of these existing commitments are complete, funding for new opportunities will represent a small share of the overall Department of Homeland Security budget. We expect Homeland Security to be a stable market with minimal growth and emphasis being placed on Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection. Congress and the Administration appropriated $33 billion to The Department of Homeland Security in fiscal year 2005. This amount is a slight decrease compared to the fiscal year 2004 appropriations of $29 billion, but still exhibits a continued commitment to homeland security. Only 50% of the federal spending on homeland security is within the newly formed Department of Homeland Security. Other federal agencies such as the DoD still have homeland security and homeland defense funding under their direction. We will continue to leverage our experience as the systems integrator on the Explosive Detection Systems program, our aviation heritage and our Integrated Battlespace and network-centric operations expertise and capabilities into the homeland security marketplace. Civil Space Transportation and Exploration Environment Congress approved very close to full funding of NASA’s fiscal year 2005 budget request, including needed funds for Space Shuttle Return to Flight, International Space Station, and new initiatives associated with the Vision for Space Exploration. NASA fiscal year 2005 appropriations of approximately $16 billion is a slight increase over the fiscal year 2004 funding level. The Administration recently released a new Space Transportation Policy. This document recognizes the critical need for Space Shuttle Return to Flight, reinforces the nation’s commitment to the Vision for Space Exploration — including the development of a Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) — provides for the evaluation of Shuttle-derived systems, and supports a viable space transportation industrial and technology base. We believe NASA will remain focused on supporting this new policy even as they transition to a new Administrator, who has yet to be named. The New Vision for Space Exploration and the priorities laid out in the new Space Transportation Policy will provide great opportunities for industry to develop new technologies and operational concepts to take human beings beyond low earth orbit. IDS, with our strong heritage in the development of space systems and our expertise in the area of human space flight, including the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station, is well positioned to work with and support our customer in accomplishing their goals. IDS will continue its work on the Space Shuttle and International Space Station programs along with development of critical technologies such as rocket propulsion and life support systems to prepare to meet the challenge of returning to the Moon and exploring the Solar System. 36 Table of Contents Launch and Satellite Environment The commercial space market has softened significantly since the late 1990s in conjunction with the downturn in the telecommunications industry. This market is now characterized by overcapacity, aggressive pricing and limited near-term opportunities. Recent projections indicate these market conditions will persist until the end of this decade. We believe there will be lower commercial satellite orders through this decade, along with lower demand for commercial launch services as compared to the high points of the early to mid-1990s. However, the replacement market for satellites will drive some recovery in the second half of this decade. In this extremely limited market, we see a growing amount of overcapacity, which in turn is driving the continued deterioration of pricing conditions. We will continue to pursue profitable commercial satellite opportunities, where the customer values our technical expertise and unique solutions, like the recently awarded order by DIRECTV. However, we will not pursue commercial satellite orders or launch contracts at a loss, and given the current pricing environment, we have decided, for the near-term, to focus on our Delta IV program on the government launch market, which we believe is a more stable market. Inherent business risks Our businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. We deal with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, including all of the branches of the U.S. military, NASA, and the Department of Homeland Security. Similar government authorities exist in our international markets. The U.S. Government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience as well as for default based on our failure to meet specified performance measurements. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for convenience (TFC), we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default (TFD), generally the U.S. Government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. The U.S. Government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default. On February 23, 2004, the U.S. Government announced plans to terminate for convenience, the RAH-66 Comanche EMD contract. The joint venture of Boeing and Sikorsky Aircraft (a division of United Technologies Corporation) had a 50/50 share in program work share and earnings. On March 19, 2004, the U.S. Government issued a partial TFC notification. By March 19, 2005, a termination proposal will be submitted and negotiations will commence with the U.S. Government shortly thereafter. The program represents less than 1% of our projected revenues for 2005 and less than 1% of our revenues for 2004. U.S. Government contracts also are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if appropriations for subsequent performance periods become unavailable. On research and development contracts, Congress usually appropriates funds on a government fiscal year basis (September 30 year-end), even though contract performance may extend over several years. Many of our contracts are fixed-price contracts (just over 50% of IDS revenues are generated from fixed-price type contracts). Of the fixed-price contracts, 40% are fixed-price delivery contracts and 10% are fixed-price milestone. While firm, fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. If the initial estimates we use to calculate the contract price prove to be incorrect, we can incur losses on those contracts. In addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost controls, schedule, and product performance. If we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, then we may not realize their full benefits. Our ability to manage costs on these contracts may affect our financial condition. Cost overruns may result in lower earnings, which would have an adverse effect on our financial results. 37 Table of Contents Just under 50% of IDS revenues are generated from cost type contracts. Revenues related to cost type contracts are recorded as costs are incurred plus an agreed upon profit in relation to the costs incurred. Cost type contracts are normally used for development and study type programs. Cost overruns on these contracts usually result in a lower profit to cost ratio. Sufficient notification must be given to the customer for any anticipated cost growth and customer authorization received to proceed in order to be reimbursed for said costs. Sales of our products and services internationally are subject not only to local government regulations and procurement policies and practices but also to the policies and approval of the U.S. Department of State and DoD. The policies of some international customers require “industrial participation” agreements, which are discussed more fully in the “Disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments” section on page 22. We are subject to business and cost classification regulations associated with our U.S. Government defense and space contracts. Violations can result in civil, criminal or administrative proceedings involving fines, compensatory and treble damages, restitution, forfeitures, and suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracts. We are continuing discussions towards resolution with the U.S. Government regarding the allocation methodology of pension costs and have assessed the impact of potential outcomes. Based on our assessment, the most probable outcome of this matter is expected to be immaterial to our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity. However, it is not possible at this time to predict when resolution will be reached nor the final outcome. 767 Tanker Program Prior to the fourth quarter of 2004 we incurred pre-contract costs related to development costs and one in-production aircraft. These costs were being deferred based on our assessment that it was probable that we would recover these costs from the USAF 767 Tanker contract. The pre-contract costs were being deferred and recorded in inventory based on AICPA Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts, which states that costs may be deferred if the costs can be associated with a specific anticipated contract and if their recoverability from that contract is probable. Our assessment of probability was based on the following: The Department of Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2005 provides $100 million funding for tanker replacement. The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2005 provides authorization for the procurement of 100 tanker aircraft and associated support contracts. We believed, based on our understanding of the requirements, that our 767 aircraft was the most cost effective solution that meets those requirements and it is therefore probable we would be awarded the USAF 767 Tanker contract. Based on prior DoD contracting practices we believed it was probable that we would also be awarded the initial support contracts. On January 14, 2005 we announced our plan to recognize pre-tax charges totaling $275 million related to the USAF 767 Tanker program. The charge is related to the initial production of the aerial refueling tankers for the USAF and includes expected supplier obligations. The Commercial Airplanes segment share of the charge is $195 million and the IDS segment share is $80 million. Within IDS, the A&WS and Support Systems segments were impacted by the charge. We used our own money and received no government funding in development of the USAF 767 Tanker. The charge, which is a result of our regular quarter and year-end reviews, reflects our updated assessment of securing the specific USAF 767 Tanker contract that was being negotiated, given the continued delay and now likely recompetition of the contract. This charge covers both incurred cost and anticipated liabilities associated with the USAF 767 Tanker program. We remain firmly committed to the USAF 767 Tanker program and are ready to support our customer in whatever decision is made regarding the recapitalization of the nation’s current aerial refueling fleet. 38 Table of Contents Sea Launch The Sea Launch venture, in which we are a 40% partner, provides ocean-based launch services to commercial satellite customers and is reported in the L&OS segment. For the year ended December 31, 2004, the venture conducted two successful launches and a third launch where the satellite reached an orbit that will meet or exceed its expected life with the aid of its propulsion system. We have issued credit guarantees to creditors of the Sea Launch venture to assist the venture in obtaining financing. In the event we are required to perform on these guarantees, we have the right to recover a portion of the loss from other venture partners. We believe our total net maximum exposure to loss from Sea Launch at December 31, 2004 totals $212 million. The components of this exposure are as follows: MaximumExposure EstimatedReserves EstablishedfromProceedsRecourse NetExposure Credit Guarantees $ 510 $ 204 $ 306 Partner Loans (Principal and Interest) 401 241 160 Advances to Provide for Future Launches 209 35 $ 174 Trade Receivable from Sea Launch 202 202 Performance Guarantees 35 1 21 13 Subcontract Termination 25 25 Other Receivables from Sea Launch 35 35 $ 1,417 $ 683 $ 522 $ 212 We made no additional capital contributions to the Sea Launch venture during the year ended December 31, 2004. (See Notes 12 and 20.) Delta IV In 1999, two employees were found to have in their possession certain information pertaining to a competitor, Lockheed Martin Corporation, under the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) Program. The employees, one of whom was a former employee of Lockheed Martin, were terminated and a third employee was disciplined and resigned. In March 2003, the USAF notified us that it was reviewing our present responsibility as a government contractor in connection with the incident. In June 2003, Lockheed Martin filed a lawsuit against us and the three individual former employees arising from the same facts. It is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of these matters or whether an adverse outcome would or could have a material adverse effect on our financial position. In addition, on July 24, 2003, the USAF suspended certain organizations in our space launch services business and the three former employees from receiving government contracts for an indefinite period as a direct result of alleged wrongdoing relating to possession of the Lockheed Martin information during the EELV source selection in 1998. The USAF also terminated 7 out of 21 of our EELV launches previously awarded through a mutual contract modification and disqualified the launch services business from competing for three additional launches under a follow-on procurement. The same incident is under investigation by the U.S. Attorney General in Los Angeles, who indicted two of the former employees in July 2003. The cost estimates for the Delta II and Delta IV programs are based, in part, upon estimated quantities and timing of launch missions for existing and anticipated contracts (the Mission Manifest) to determine the allocation of fixed costs for individual launches. Revenue estimates include probable price adjustments due to contractual statement of work changes where we have established contractual entitlement. The Mission Manifest represents management’s best estimate of the launch services market, taking into account all known information. Due to the volatility of the government launch market, and the current suspension, as described in Note 23, it is possible that changes in quantity and 39 Table of Contents timing of launches could occur that would change the Mission Manifest and therefore the financial performance of the Delta programs. The Delta II and IV programs are reported in the L&OS segment. Satellites As is the standard for the commercial satellite industry contracts are fixed price in nature. Many of the existing satellite programs have very complex designs including unique phased array antenna designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we have continued to experience schedule delays and cost impacts. If the issues continue they could result in a material charge. These programs are on-going, and while we believe the cost estimates reflected in the December 31, 2004 financial statements are adequate and appropriate, the technical complexity of the satellites create financial risk, as additional completion costs may become necessary, or scheduled delivery dates could be missed, which could trigger TFD provisions or other financially significant exposure. In 2004, two satellites were delivered retiring the TFD risk on those satellites. At the end of 2004, we had one commercial satellite contract (NSS-8) that could have exposed us to the risk of contract TFD notification. In January 2005, we entered into an amended agreement with New Skies Satellites B.V. which revised the satellite’s contractual delivery schedule, payments and other terms. As a result of this agreement, management no longer believes that we have a material risk of contract TFD notification. The agreement increases the financial exposure to the performance of the satellite over its contracted on-orbit life. The estimated earnings impact of this agreement has been recognized in 2004. Our satellite programs are reported in either the Network Systems or L&OS segments. On August 16, 2004, in response to a draft demand for arbitration from ICO Global Communications (Operations), Ltd. (ICO) seeking return of monies paid by ICO to Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. (BSSI) under contracts for manufacture and launch of communications satellites, BSSI filed a complaint for declaratory relief against ICO in Los Angeles County Superior Court. BSSI’s suit seeks declaratory judgment that ICO’s prior termination of the contracts for convenience extinguished all claims between the parties. ICO filed a cross complaint with the court on September 16, 2004, alleging breach of contract, other claims, and seeking recovery of all amounts it invested in the contracts, approximately $2 billion. We believe that ICO’s claims lack merit and intend to aggressively pursue our suit against ICO for declaratory relief and to vigorously defend against ICO’s cross-complaint. On September 10, 2004, a group of insurance underwriters for Thuraya Satellite Telecommunications (Thuraya) requested arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), against BSSI. The Request for Arbitration alleges that BSSI breached its contract with Thuraya for sale of a 702 Satellite which experienced anomalies with its concentrator solar arrays. The claimants seek approximately $238 million consisting of insurance payments either already made to Thuraya or currently in dispute between Thuraya and its insurers, as well as reserving their right to increase the amount claimed to $365 million (plus claims of interest, costs, and fees), comprising the total loss allegedly incurred by Thuraya. We believe that these claims lack merit and intend to vigorously defend against them. BSSI filed its answer to the arbitration on December 2, 2004 with the ICC. In certain launch and satellite sales contracts, we include provisions for replacement launch services or hardware if we do not meet specified performance criteria. We have historically purchased insurance to cover these exposures when allowed under the terms of the contract. The current insurance market reflects unusually high premium rates and also suffers from a lack of capacity to handle all insurance requirements. We make decisions on the procurement of third-party insurance based on our analysis of risk. There is one contractual launch scheduled in early 2005 for which full insurance coverage may not be available, or if available, could be prohibitively expensive. We will continue to review this risk. We estimate that the potential uninsured amount for this launch could range between $65 million to $315 million depending on the nature of the uninsured event. 40 Table of Contents Integrated Defense Systems (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 30,465 $ 27,361 $ 24,957 % of Total Company Revenues 58 % 54 % 46 % Operating Earnings $ 2,925 $ 766 $ 2,009 Operating Margins 9.6 % 2.8 % 8.0 % Research and Development $ 834 $ 846 $ 742 Contractual Backlog $ 39,151 $ 40,883 $ 36,014 Revenues Increased revenues from 2003 to 2004 were driven by three segments. A&WS revenues increased in total by $628 million. This increase was due to additional production aircraft deliveries, remanufactured rotorcraft deliveries and amounts recognized on development programs such as the EA-18G Growler, partially offset by decreased F-15 and JDAM volume. Network Systems revenues grew by over $2 billion from increased volume in the Missile Defense and Integrated Battlespace markets including such programs as GMD, FCS, Intelligence, Airborne Command and Control programs and the ramp up of the MMA of $2.3 billion. This growth was partially offset by reduced Homeland Security & Services revenue volume. Increased volume in spares, Training Systems & Services, Life Cycle Customer Support (LCCS) and Modernization & Upgrades of $560 million was partially offset by decreased Contractor Logistical Support & Services (CLSS) in the Support Systems segment. L&OS revenues remained constant with increased Return to Flight activity in the NASA businesses and a satellite TFC settlement of $240 million, offset by decreased satellite and Delta launch deliveries and satellite milestone slips. Increased revenues from 2002 to 2003 were primarily driven by additional production aircraft and JDAM deliveries and F/A-22 Raptor volume in A&WS increased volume in Homeland Security & Services, Intelligence programs and the start up of FCS in Network Systems; increased volume in spares, maintenance and LCCS in Support Systems; and increased Delta launch deliveries in L&OS. Operating Earnings The increase in operating earnings from 2003 to 2004 reflects strong performance from the A&WS, Network Systems and Support Systems segments partially offset by losses recorded in the L&OS segment. Operating earnings were also negatively impacted by $80 million of charges taken in the fourth quarter of 2004 related to the USAF 767 Tanker program. In 2004, A&WS earnings were driven by an increased revenue base contributing $82 million from the segment’s major production programs as a result of efficiencies achieved through lean initiatives to reduce costs by $210 million, partially offset by the USAF 767 Tanker charge of $62 million taken in the fourth quarter of 2004 and increased research and development investment on the 767 GTTA program. Network Systems segment earnings improved from 2003 primarily due to increased revenues generating additional earnings of $200 million and improved performance from the Homeland Security & Services, Military Satellite Communications and Intelligence programs of $147 million, partially offset by cost growth in the Missile Defense market. 2003 Network Systems earnings were also impacted by a $55 million charge related to our investment in a joint venture that lost an imagery contract award. Support Systems had another outstanding year driven by an increase in revenue that generated additional earnings of $45 million along with improved performance of $139 million throughout the segment’s businesses. The Support segment was also impacted by the USAF 767 Tanker charge taken in the fourth quarter of 2004 by $18 million. L&OS operating earnings improved from 2003 to 2004 driven by the 2003 charges described in the L&OS discussion. Excluding the 2003 charges, 2004 operating earnings were lower due to cost growth from technical and quality issues on satellites currently in the factory and write-offs of slow moving satellite inventory coupled with decreased Delta IV deliveries in 2004, partially offset by increased USA Venture earnings and increased NASA Systems Shuttle Return to Flight volume. 41 Table of Contents The decreased operating earnings from 2002 to 2003 reflects increased operating losses recorded for the L&OS segment, partially offset by strong performance from the A&WS, Network Systems and Support Systems segments. In 2003, A&WS earnings were driven by strong performance from the segments major production programs and an increased revenue base. Network Systems segment earnings improved from 2002 primarily due to increased revenues in Homeland Security & Services, FCS and proprietary programs, partially offset by cost growth on military satellite programs and a charge related to our investment in a joint venture. Support Systems had another outstanding year driven by an increased revenue base along with improved performance in many of the segment’s businesses. The L&OS segment was impacted by charges throughout the year described in detail in the L&OS segment discussion. Backlog The decrease in contractual backlog from 2003 to 2004 is attributed to sales on multi-year contracts that were awarded in prior periods, particularly the C-17 and F/A-18 programs in A&WS and strong sales on the GMD program and proprietary programs in Network Systems. The decrease was partially offset by orders in L&OS, satellites and Shuttle Return to Flight and Shuttle contract extensions, as well as orders in the Support Systems segment. IDS total backlog decreased by 5% from 2003 to 2004 primarily from sales on multi-year contracts that were awarded in prior periods, partially offset by contract awards for the MMA, FCS program extension and an order from DIRECTV for 3 satellites. Aircraft & Weapon Systems (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 11,394 $ 10,766 $ 10,569 % of Total Company Revenues 22 % 21 % 20 % Operating Earnings $ 1,636 $ 1,422 $ 1,269 Operating Margins 14.4 % 13.2 % 12.0 % Research and Development $ 382 $ 360 $ 304 Contractual Backlog $ 18,256 $ 19,352 $ 15,862 Revenues A&WS increased revenues from 2003 to 2004 were driven by additional deliveries on F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and AH-64 Apache programs, increased remanufactured deliveries on rotorcraft programs, and additional hardware deliveries on the F/A-22 Raptor program. 2004 A&WS revenues also grew with increased development volume on programs such as EA-18G Growler. A&WS increased revenues between 2002 to 2003 were primarily driven by additional deliveries on JDAM, F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15E Eagle and F/A-22 Raptor volume, partially offset by lower rotorcraft deliveries. Deliveries of units for principal production programs were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 C-17 Globemaster 16 16 16 F/A-18E/F Super Hornet 48 44 40 T-45TS Goshawk 7 12 14 F-15E Eagle 3 4 3 CH-47 Chinook* — — 7 737 C-40A Clipper 3 1 3 AH-64 Apache* 3 — 15 * New Builds Only 42 Table of Contents Operating Earnings A&WS 2004 operating earnings growth reflects increased revenues, strong performance on our major production programs resulting from manufacturing cost of sales efficiencies achieved through lean initiatives, risk mitigation efforts, and reductions in period expenses associated with the expanding business base. A&WS 2004 results were adversely impacted by a pre-tax charge of $62 million that was taken in the fourth quarter of 2004 related to the USAF 767 Tanker program. A&WS 2003 operating earnings growth reflected increased revenues, strong performance on our major production programs and a favorable adjustment of $45 million associated with the F-15 Eagle program pre-tax charges of $270 million initially taken in 1999. The adjustment amount was based on negotiated termination liability with suppliers and aircraft deliveries that incorporated inventory associated with the original 1999 charge. Research and Development A&WS segment continues to focus its research and development where it can use its customer knowledge, technical strength and large-scale integration capabilities to provide transformational solutions for the war fighter’s needs. Research and development activities leverage our capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies across a broad spectrum of capabilities designed to enhance situational awareness and survivability; increase mission effectiveness and interoperability and improve affordability, reliability and economic ownership. Continued research and development investments in unmanned systems have enabled the demonstration of multi-vehicle coordinated flight and distributed control of high performance unmanned combat air vehicles. Research and development in advanced weapons technologies emphasizes, among other things, precision guidance and multi-mode targeting as evidenced by our successful Small Diameter Bomb (SDB) offering. Research and development investments in the GTTA program represents a significant opportunity to provide state of the art refueling capabilities to domestic and international customers, demonstrating the synergistic value of our diversified company-wide portfolio. Other research and development efforts include upgrade and technology insertions to network-enable and enhance the capability and competitiveness of current product lines such as the F/A-18E/F Hornet, F-15E Eagle, AH-64 Apache, CH-47 Chinook and C-17 Globemaster III. Backlog A&WS contractual backlog decreased from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to sales on multi-year contracts that were awarded in prior periods. This was partially offset by orders on Chinook, T-45, V-22 and the Joint Helmet-Mounted Cueing system programs. A&WS increased contractual backlog from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributed to the capture of several key awards including the F/A-18 E/F Multi Year II contract, Apache helicopter new builds, and the initial funding for the EA-18G. Backlog also increased due to rate increase on the F/A-22 low rate initial production and weapon orders for SDB, Harpoon, and SLAM-ER. Network Systems (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 11,432 $ 9,384 $ 8,113 % of Total Company Revenues 22 % 19 % 15 % Operating Earnings $ 993 $ 626 $ 546 Operating Margins 8.7 % 6.7 % 6.7 % Research and Development $ 234 $ 195 $ 132 Contractual Backlog $ 10,190 $ 11,715 $ 6,700 Revenues Increased revenues for the Network Systems segment in 2004 were primarily driven by increased volume from the Missile Defense and Integrated Battlespace markets including programs such as GMD, FCS, Intelligence, Airborne Command and Control programs and the ramp up of the MMA, partially offset by reduced activities in Homeland Security & Services. 43 Table of Contents Network Systems increased revenues from 2002 to 2003 were primarily driven by the ramp up of the FCS program, increased activity in Intelligence and Homeland Security & Services programs, and the successful launch of a Naval satellite (UHF F11). Operating Earnings Network Systems 2004 earnings results were primarily driven by increased revenue stated above, in addition to improved performance on Airborne Command and Control, Military Satellite Communication, Intelligence programs and capture of award fee earnings on cost type contracts. 2003 results were adversely impacted by a $55 million pre-tax non-cash charge taken on Resource 21 (a joint venture we had entered into) as a result of a decision by NASA to not award an imagery contract to Resource 21. Network Systems increased earnings from 2002 to 2003 were primarily driven by the increased revenue while partially offset by the military satellite cost growth and the Resource 21 write-off mentioned earlier. Research and Development The Network Systems research and development funding remains focused on the development of Communications and Command & Control capabilities that support a network-centric architecture approach for our various government customers. We are investing in the communications market to enable connectivity between existing air/ground platforms, increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and leverage innovative communications concepts. Key programs in this area include Joint Tactical Radio System, Global Positioning System, and Transformational Communications System. Investments were also made to support various Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance business opportunities including MMA, AEW&C aircraft, and concepts that will lead to the development of next-generation space intelligence systems. A major contributor to our support of these DoD transformation programs is the investment in the Boeing Integration Center (BIC) and extended network of modeling, simulation and analysis capabilities where our Network-Centric Operations concepts are developed in partnership with our customers. Along with increased funding to support these areas of architecture and network-centric capabilities development, we also maintained our investment levels in Global Missile Defense and advanced missile defense concepts and technologies. In 2004 we continued investment to pursue the Homeland Security & Services market, with emphasis on funding to develop and tailor the network-centric capabilities already being applied to many DoD opportunities in this emerging market. Backlog Network Systems contractual backlog decreased from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the strong sales on GMD and IDS Proprietary programs from orders received in 2003. This was partially offset by orders on the FCS program and the capture of the MMA program that contributed to IDS total backlog in 2004. The 75% increase in contractual backlog from 2002 to 2003 is mainly attributed to the initial funding of the FCS program and orders for the GMD and Turkey 737 AEW&C programs. Support Systems (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 4,670 $ 4,219 $ 3,484 % of Total Company Revenues 9 % 8 % 6 % Operating Earnings $ 638 $ 472 $ 376 Operating Margins 13.7 % 11.2 % 10.8 % Research and Development $ 57 $ 59 $ 43 Contractual Backlog $ 6,505 $ 5,882 $ 5,286 Revenues Support Systems increased revenues from 2003 to 2004 were driven by increased volume in Training Systems & Services, Spares for tactical aircraft, LCCS, and Modernization & Upgrades, partially offset by decreased CLSS activity. 44 Table of Contents Support Systems increased revenues from 2002 to 2003 were driven by increased volume in spares for tactical aircraft, LCCS, Maintenance & Modification, and CLSS. Operating Earnings Support Systems increased operating earnings from 2003 to 2004 were driven by the revenue volume stated above, favorable contract closeout activity and cost reductions through improved efficiencies generating strong performance throughout the businesses. Support Systems 2004 results were adversely impacted by a pre-tax charge of $18 million that was taken in the fourth quarter of 2004 related to the USAF 767 Tanker program. Support Systems increased operating earnings from 2002 and 2003 were due to a higher revenue base and performance improvement in the Supply Chain Services and Modification & Upgrades businesses. Research and Development Support Systems continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including Engineering and Logistic Services, Maintenance, Modifications & Upgrades, Supply Chain Services, Training and Support Systems and Advanced Logistics Services. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative, disciplined tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Examples of successful programs stemming from these investment strategies include the C-17 Globemaster Sustainment Partnership, C-130U Gunship 4 Buy and C-130 Avionics Modernization Program. Backlog Support Systems increased contractual backlog from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to orders on LCCS programs. Also contributing to the increase were Modernization & Upgrade programs, partially offset by strong sales on Supply Chain Services programs. The increase in contractual backlog from 2002 to 2003 is attributed to orders for C-17 sustainment and KC-10 support as well as orders in the CLSS business. Launch & Orbital Systems (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 2,969 $ 2,992 $ 2,791 % of Total Company Revenues 5 % 6 % 5 % Operating Losses $ (342 ) $ (1,754 ) $ (182 ) Operating Margins (11.5 )% (58.6 )% (6.5 )% Research and Development $ 161 $ 232 $ 263 Contractual Backlog $ 4,200 $ 3,934 $ 8,166 Revenues L&OS revenues remained constant from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the increased return to flight activity in the NASA businesses and a satellite TFC settlement offset by lower satellite and Delta launch deliveries and delays in satellite milestone completions. L&OS revenues increased from 2002 to 2003 primarily due to increased Delta launch deliveries. Deliveries of production units were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Delta II 4 4 3 Delta IV – 2 1 BSS Satellites 2 3 6 45 Table of Contents Operating Earnings L&OS increased operating earnings from 2003 to 2004 were driven by the 2003 charges described below. Excluding the 2003 charges, 2004 operating earnings were lower due to cost growth from technical and quality issues on satellites currently in the factory and write-offs of slow moving satellite inventory coupled with no Delta IV deliveries in 2004, partially offset by increased USA joint venture earnings and NASA Systems Shuttle Return to Flight volume. L&OS 2003 operating earnings were negatively impacted by a first quarter goodwill impairment charge of $572 million. This impairment charge resulted during an internal reorganization, when the SFAS No. 142 reportable segments, operating segments, and reporting unit designations changed, causing significantly different relationships between reporting unit carrying values and fair values. Specifically, the new L&OS reporting unit was created by combining six pre-existing reporting units: Boeing Satellite Systems, Human Space Flight & Exploration, Expendable Launch Systems, United Space Alliance Joint Venture, Rocketdyne Propulsion & Power, and Sea Launch Joint Venture. The carrying value of one of these reporting units, Boeing Satellite Systems, exceeded its fair value resulting in the goodwill balances at this reporting unit being fully impaired during calendar year 2002. However, the carrying values of the other five reporting units were less than their fair values, so the goodwill balances at these reporting units were not impaired during calendar year 2002. In addition, the BoD approved in early 2003 our long range business plan which included downward revisions to cash flow projections for the L&OS reporting unit. The combination of these factors resulted in the newly created L&OS reporting unit having a carrying value that exceeded its fair value, prompting recognition of the goodwill impairment charge. L&OS 2003 operating earnings were further impacted by a second quarter charge of $1,030 million of which $835 million was attributable to the Delta IV program, caused by a combination of factors. The most significant of these factors was the requirement to spread fixed costs of the Delta IV program to an overall reduced number of anticipated launches as a result of continued weakness in the commercial space launch market, accounting for $412 million of the charge. The Delta IV program experienced cost growth of $360 million, primarily related to payload integration and launch support costs. In each of these cases, the additional costs were not billable under the respective contracts. In addition, the remaining $63 million of the charge resulted from determining it was no longer probable that our U.S. Government customer would agree to price increases for change orders in connection with existing contracted and awarded Delta IV launches as a result of the EELV procurement integrity issue. The remaining $195 million of the second quarter charge relates to Boeing Satellite Systems incurring additional costs as a result of satellite program complexities. These complexities caused technical and quality issues resulting in schedule delays, cost impacts, and late delivery penalties, which were not billable under the respective contract. The 2003 results also include the adjustments made to equity investments in Ellipso, SkyBridge and Teledesic resulting in a net write-down of $27 million. The 2002 results include a $100 million pre-tax charge to write-down an equity investment in Teledesic, LLC. Also contributing to the 2002 decreased operating earnings was cost growth on commercial satellite programs and the continued downturn in the launch and commercial satellite market. We are a 50/50 partner with Lockheed Martin in a joint venture called United Space Alliance, which is responsible for all ground processing of the Space Shuttle fleet and for space-related operations with the USAF. United Space Alliance also performs modifications, testing and checkout operations that are required to ready the Space Shuttle for launch. United Space Alliance operations are performed under cost-plus-type contracts. Our 50% share of joint venture earnings is recognized as income. The segment’s operating earnings include earnings of $70 million, $52 million, and $68 million, for 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, attributable to United Space Alliance. These results include all known or expected impacts related to the Space Shuttle program based on the findings from the Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB) investigation. 46 Table of Contents Research and Development Our research and development investment in L&OS declined as most versions of the Delta IV expendable launch vehicle reached operational status. Continued investment was made in the Delta IV Heavy program to support the successful demonstration launch in December 2004. We also continue to make investments in this segment to develop key technologies and systems solutions to support our NASA customer in the development of new space exploration systems. Prudent investment of research and development resources was made in the satellite manufacturing business to enhance existing designs to meet evolving customer requirements. Backlog L&OS contractual backlog increased from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to orders in our Commercial Satellite (DIRECTV order for 3 satellites) and NASA businesses. This increase was partially offset by solid sales from our NASA business unit. The contractual backlog decrease from 2002 to 2003 was due to the adjustment in the Delta IV Launch manifest. The adjustment was a result of missions lost on the EELV (see “EELV Suspension” in Risk Factors section) contract and a continued weakness in the commercial space market and sales on the existing orders. Boeing Capital Corporation Business Environment and Trends At December 31, 2004, BCC’s portfolio consisted of financing leases, notes and other receivables, equipment under operating leases, investments and assets held for sale or re-lease. BCC’s strategic direction has shifted from a focus on growing the portfolio to a focus on supporting our major operating units and managing overall portfolio risk exposures. For the commercial aircraft market, BCC facilitates, arranges, structures and/or provides selective financing solutions to our Commercial Airplanes segment customers. For the defense and space markets, BCC primarily engages in arranging and structuring financing solutions for our IDS segment government customers. In addition, BCC continues to enhance its risk management activities to manage exposures associated with its current portfolio and future business activities. On May 24, 2004, BCC entered into a purchase and sale agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC) to sell substantially all of the assets related to its former Commercial Financial Services business, which was primarily engaged in providing lease and loan financing to a broad range of commercial and industrial customers. (See Note 9). The assets sold to GECC consisted of leases and financing arrangements having a carrying value of $1.9 billion as of May 31, 2004. The purchase agreement, as amended, called for the sale of the assets to take place in a series of closings, commencing on May 31, 2004 and ending no later than December 31, 2004. The final asset sale closed on December 27, 2004. BCC intends to dispose of the remaining assets identified to its Commercial Financial Services business that are not subject to the purchase and sale agreement with GECC by the end of the second quarter of 2005. Refer to discussion of the airline industry environment in the Commercial Airplanes – Business Environments and Trends. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. The number of worldwide parked commercial jet aircraft has declined by approximately 100 aircraft from the number of aircraft parked at December 31, 2003, reaching a new post-September 11, 2001 low in terms of both the number of parked aircraft and the parked percentage of the active fleet. Approximately 1,900 commercial jet aircraft (10.6% of current world fleet) continue to be parked, including both in production and out-of-production aircraft types. 47 Table of Contents BCC’s portfolio at December 31, 2004 totaled $9.7 billion, of which $9.3 billion was related to our products, primarily commercial aircraft. While worldwide traffic levels exceed traffic levels carried by the airlines in 2000, the effects of declining yields and higher fuel prices on the airline industry continue to impact commercial aircraft values. Recently published sources and market transactions indicate that, while lease rates for aircraft are increasing, values for the various aircraft types serving as collateral in BCC’s portfolio generally have not increased. Aircraft valuations could decline materially if significant numbers of aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are idled on account of further airline bankruptcies or restructurings. At the same time, the credit ratings of many airlines, particularly in the U.S., have remained at low levels. On January 12, 2005, Commercial Airplanes decided to conclude production of the 717 program in 2006 due to the lack of overall market demand for the aircraft. While BCC continues to believe in the utility and marketability of the 717 aircraft, BCC is unable to predict whether or how the end of the 717 program, as well as overall market conditions, may impact 717 aircraft values and rental rates. At December 31, 2004, $2.4 billion of BCC’s portfolio was collateralized by 717 aircraft. Should the 717 aircraft suffer a significant decline in utility and market acceptance, the aircraft values may decline, which could result in an increase to the allowance for losses on receivables. While BCC is unable to predict the likelihood of these impacts occurring, such impacts could result in a potential material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. In October 2003, Commercial Airplanes announced the decision to end production of the 757 program, and the final aircraft was produced in October 2004. While BCC is unable to determine how much of the 757 used aircraft value decline was attributable to the decision to end production of the 757 program, the impact of any declines in 757 used aircraft values due to this decision had been reflected in reserves, as of December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2004, $1.5 billion of BCC’s portfolio was collateralized by 757 aircraft of various vintages and variants. This included $1.2 billion of passenger aircraft (33 aircraft at 12 operators). The remainder of the 757 portfolio consisted of converted freighters on long-term lease. At December 31, 2004, BCC had $37 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, of which $25 million were identified with firm contracts to be placed on lease. Additionally, approximately $409 million of BCC’s portfolio currently represents scheduled lease terminations in 2005 for which the related aircraft will be remarketed, of which $109 million were identified with firm contracts in place at December 31, 2004 to be sold or placed on lease. Potential delays in selling or placing these assets on lease at reasonable rates may negatively affect BCC’s earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. Significant Customer Contingencies A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is concentrated among commercial airline customers. Certain customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or requested lease or loan restructurings; these negotiations were in various stages as of December 31, 2004. These bankruptcies or restructurings could have a material adverse effect on BCC’s earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. United Airlines, Inc. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, United accounted for $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion (11.7% and 11.5%) of BCC’s total portfolio. At December 31, 2004, the United portfolio was secured by security interests in two 767 aircraft and 13 777 aircraft and by an ownership and security interests in five 757 aircraft. At December 31, 2004, United was current on all of its obligations related to these 20 aircraft. At December 31, 2004, United was BCC’s second largest customer. United continues to operate under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On June 28, 2004, United’s application to obtain federal loan guarantees was denied by the Airline Transportation Stabilization Board, which also withdrew United’s eligibility to reapply. On August 20, 2004, United obtained approval from the bankruptcy court to extend its debtor-in-possession financing credit facilities through June 30, 2005 48 Table of Contents and increase its available funds by $500 million. United is continuing to pursue alternative financing through private investors. During the third quarter of 2003, BCC completed a restructuring of United’s aircraft loans and leases. The lease rate for the five 757s on lease to United was negotiated downward. BCC applied guidance in SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases, and determined that these leases were required to be reclassified from finance leases to operating leases. The loans with United were restructured to defer certain principal payments by extending the maturity of the loans. BCC applied the guidance in SFAS No. 15, Accounting for Debtors and Creditors for Troubled Debt Restructurings, and determined that a troubled debt restructuring charge was not required because the effective yield of each loan receivable after the restructuring was equal to or greater than its effective yield prior to the restructuring. United retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including the right to reject the restructuring terms with its creditors and return aircraft, including BCC’s aircraft. The terms of BCC’s restructuring with United, which were approved by the federal bankruptcy court, set forth the terms under which all 20 aircraft BCC financed are expected to remain in service upon United’s emergence from Chapter 11 protection. If United exercises its right to reject the agreed upon restructuring terms, the terms of all of the leases and loans with United would immediately revert to the original terms, which are generally less favorable to United. United would retain its rights under Chapter 11 to return BCC’s aircraft in the event of a reversion to the original lease and loan terms. During the fourth quarter of 2004, United requested that BCC restructure its financing terms as part of their ongoing efforts to emerge from bankruptcy. BCC is currently evaluating the request from United. ATA Holdings Corp. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, ATA Holdings Corp. (ATA) accounted for $705 million and $743 million (7.3% and 7.3%) of BCC’s total portfolio. At December 31, 2004, the ATA portfolio primarily consisted of 12 finance leases for 757 aircraft and an investment in ATA mandatorily redeemable preferred stock with a face value of $50 million, which was written down to zero in 2004. During the third quarter of 2004, BCC’s assessment of ATA’s continued financial difficulties led them to conclude that its portfolio of finance leases and note receivable with ATA were specifically impaired. Accordingly, in 2004, BCC increased its allowance for losses on receivables by approximately $49 million (an additional $38 million was recorded by the Other segment) in order to reserve for the amount by which the carrying value of the ATA related assets exceeded the assets’ collateral values. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2004, ATA requested that BCC restructure its finance lease terms and provide additional short-term financing support. On October 26, 2004, ATA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As a result, on December 29, 2004, BCC entered into an agreement in principle with ATA whereby ATA agreed to continue to lease the 12 757s under restructured terms and agreed to return eight of the 12 757s during the second half of 2005 and early 2006. The restructured lease terms with ATA, including ATA’s agreement to return the eight 757 aircraft starting in July 2005 are subject to approval by the bankruptcy court. ATA is obligated to pay rent on all aircraft until returned. While BCC believes it has provided for an adequate allowance for losses on receivables on ATA’s finance leases and notes receivable, in the event that future negotiations or proceedings result in the return of a substantial number of aircraft, there could be a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position, at least until such time as the aircraft are sold or redeployed for adequate consideration. Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, Hawaiian Airlines, Inc. (Hawaiian) accounted for $456 million and $506 million (4.7% and 5.0%) of BCC’s total portfolio. At December 31, 2004, the Hawaiian portfolio consisted of 11 717 aircraft and three 767 aircraft. Hawaiian filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on March 21, 2003. In December 2003 and January 2004, BCC 49 Table of Contents permitted Hawaiian to return two 717 aircraft leased by BCC. These 717 aircraft were leased to a third party in the first quarter of 2004. In September 2004, BCC reached an agreement with the bankruptcy trustee for the Hawaiian estate relating to the restructuring of all of its leases and on the amount of its unsecured claim resulting from Hawaiian’s bankruptcy. The claim amount represented costs and losses incurred by BCC for the period of time prior to the September 2004 settlement and losses that would be incurred by BCC based on the differences between the restructured and the original lease payments. On September 27, 2004, following a request by Hawaiian’s trustee, the bankruptcy court approved BCC’s unsecured claim against the Hawaiian estate and also approved the new terms of its restructured leases. In September 2004, BCC sold its unsecured claim to RC Aviation LLC (Ranch). In connection with the approval of its claim by the bankruptcy court, BCC recorded $35 million of income relating to recovered costs and lost revenues prior to the approval of the claim by the bankruptcy court. Additionally, as a result of BCC’s approval of claims for lost lease rental revenue, BCC recorded $31 million of unearned income associated with its 767 leases to Hawaiian. BCC recorded a provision for losses of $13 million due to the difference between the approved bankruptcy claim and the amount it received when it sold the claim. Prior to Hawaiian’s bankruptcy, BCC accounted for all of its 717 leases and two of its three 767 leases as finance leases. Subsequent to the approval of the restructured lease terms, BCC will continue to account for these leases as finance leases. Hawaiian retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including the right to reject restructuring terms with its creditors and return aircraft, including BCC’s aircraft. The terms of BCC’s restructuring with Hawaiian, which were approved by the federal bankruptcy court, set forth the terms under which all 14 aircraft financed by BCC are expected to remain in service upon Hawaiian’s emergence from Chapter 11 protection. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) 2004 2003 2002 Revenues $ 959 $ 991 $ 764 % of Total Company Revenues 2 % 2 % 1 % Operating Earnings $ 183 $ 91 $ 35 Operating Margins 19.1 % 9.2 % 4.6 % At December 31, 2004 2003 Portfolio $ 9,680 $ 10,118 % of Total Receivables in Valuation Allowance 4.2 % 5.1 % Debt $ 7,024 $ 9,177 Debt-to-Equity Ratio 5.0-to-1 4.7-to-1 Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of interest from financing receivables and notes, lease income from operating lease equipment, investment income, gains on disposals of investments and gains/losses on revaluation of derivatives. The decrease in revenue in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily attributable to lower new business volume. The increase in revenue in 2003 compared with 2002 was primarily attributable to growth in the portfolio. Operating Earnings BCC’s operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for losses adjustments, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating 50 Table of Contents expenses. The increase in 2004 operating earnings was principally driven by a substantial decrease in the provision for losses from a provision of $151 million in 2003 to a recovery of $38 million in 2004 due to receivable recoveries and asset sales during 2004, lower charges related to receivable restructurings in 2004 compared with 2003, the mitigation of collateral exposure from agreements with certain customers, and refinements in portfolio measurements in 2004 and a decline in BCC’s receivables portfolio. The increase in net income was partially offset by a decrease in BCC’s total revenue and increases in operating expenses, higher asset impairment expense related primarily to the writedown of two investments and debt redemption costs. As summarized in the following table, during the year ended December 31, 2004, we recognized pre-tax expenses of $165 million in response to the deterioration in the credit worthiness of BCC’s airline customers, airline bankruptcy filings and the continued decline in the commercial aircraft and general equipment asset values, of which $68 million related to BCC. For the same period in 2003, we recognized pre-tax expenses of $338 million, of which $272 million related to BCC. (Dollars in millions) BCCSegment OtherSegment Consolidated 2004 Provision (recovery) for losses $ (38 ) $ 82 $ 44 Revaluation of equipment on operating lease or held for sale or re-lease 27 2 29 Other adjustments 79 13 92 $ 68 $ 97 $ 165 2003 Provision for losses $ 151 $ 61 $ 212 Revaluation of equipment on operating lease or held for sale or re-lease 100 5 105 Other adjustments 21 21 $ 272 $ 66 $ 338 During 2004, BCC’s decrease in the provision for losses included a special reduction of $55 million offset by the normal monthly provision of $17 million. The primary factors contributing to this reduction in the provision for losses during the year ended December 31, 2004 were: $53 million of benefit from the mitigation of collateral exposure from agreements with certain customers; $28 million of net benefit due to refinements in the methodology for measuring collateral values; $11 million of net benefit due to the sale of various notes thus decreasing collateral exposure; and a $49 million increase in the requirement in the allowance account resulting from the determination that receivables from ATA were subject to a specific impairment. The Other segment recorded an $82 million charge to earnings during the year ended December 31, 2004, compared to $61 million and $80 million during the same period in 2003 and 2002. The increase in the Other segment’s provision for losses during the year ended December 31, 2004 was due to deteriorated airline credit ratings and depressed aircraft values based on our quarterly assessment of the adequacy of customer financing reserves, which was primarily related to the determination that receivables from ATA were subject to a specific impairment. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2004, BCC recorded pre-tax non-cash asset impairment-related charges totaling $106 million. This was comprised of $47 million related to an other-than-temporary impairment of a held-to-maturity investment in ATA maturing in 2015, $32 million related to the impairment of a D tranche EETC which finances aircraft with Delta, $16 million of specific impairment charges related primarily to aircraft trading and $11 million of valuation loss on one Boeing Business Jet reclassified from discontinued operations to continuing operations as a result of our 51 Table of Contents decision to retain the aircraft in our executive fleet. During the same period of 2003, BCC recognized charges of $121 million, of which $21 million was due to the write-off of forward-starting interest rate swaps related to Hawaiian. During the same period of 2002, BCC recognized charges of $93 million. Additionally, the Other segment recognized charges of $15 million, $5 million, and $146 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. During 2004, the charge consisted of $13 million related to the decline in lease rates on certain aircraft and a charge of $2 million related to aircraft and equipment under operating lease and held for sale or re-lease. BCC carefully monitors the relative value of aircraft equipment since we remain at substantial economic risk to significant decreases in the value of aircraft equipment and their associated lease rates. Other Segment Other segment operating losses were $535 million during 2004 as compared to losses of $379 million during 2003. The increase in operating losses reflects increased costs of $36 million at Connexion by BoeingSM in conjunction with the launch of commercial services which began in May 2004, a $61 million write-off of depreciation related to a demolished building, an $18 million loss related to accounting for various real property transactions and increased employer taxes of $12 million related to our share value trust payout. As of December 31, 2004, we had investments of approximately $3.4 billion. On an ongoing basis, we perform an impairment test on our investment securities to determine if the fair value decline of a security is other-than-temporary. If the impairment is other-than-temporary, we reset the cost basis for the impaired security and record the charge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. (See Note 12.) Research and development activities in the Other segment relates primarily to Connexion by BoeingSM. Research and development activities in the Other segment remained constant in 2004. Astro Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary, operates as a captive insurance company. This subsidiary enables certain of our exposures to be insured at the lowest possible cost to us. In addition, it provides flexibility to us in structuring our insurance and risk management programs and provides access to the reinsurance markets. Currently, Astro Ltd. insures a portion of our aviation liability, workers compensation, general liability, property, as well as various smaller risk liability insurances. Critical Accounting Policies and Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented Application of Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominately by the A&WS, Network Systems, Support Systems and L&OS segments within IDS. These activities include the following products and systems: military aircraft, helicopters, missiles, space systems, missile defense systems, satellites, rocket engines, and information and battle management systems. The majority of business conducted in these segments is performed under contracts with the U.S. Government and foreign governments that extend over a number of years. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). 52 Table of Contents The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. Government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Sales related to contracts with fixed prices are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. Sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. Contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if targets are achieved. Incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated are recorded over the performance period of the contract. Incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contract’s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Assumptions are made regarding the length of time to complete each contract because estimated costs also include expected changes in wages, prices for materials, fixed costs, and other costs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. During 2004, IDS’s gross margin performance fell within the historical range of plus or minus 0.5% change to gross margin. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in IDS for all of 2004 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 0.5%, it would have increased or decreased income for the year by approximately $152 million. Program Accounting We use program accounting to account for sales and cost of sales related to all our commercial airplane programs by the Commercial Airplanes segment. Program accounting is a method of accounting applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. Under program accounting, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling costs and warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. To establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a) the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b) the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c) the units’ expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling, and warranty costs for the total program. (See Commercial Airplanes discussion in the Accounting Quantity section.) 53 Table of Contents The use of estimates in program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. Factors that must be estimated include sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured parts, major component costs, and overhead costs. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are recognized on a prospective basis. Underlying all estimates used for program accounting is the forecasted market and corresponding production rates. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. We recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. The sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula. The amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer during the quarter. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new airplane program (known as the “learning curve effect”), the actual costs incurred for production of the early units in the program will exceed the amount reported as cost of sales for those units. The excess or actual costs over the amount reported as cost of sales is presented as “deferred production costs,” which are included in inventory along with unamortized tooling costs. Our experience in the last two years, with all current programs being relatively mature, has been that estimated changes due to model mix, escalation, cost performance, and accounting quantity adjustments have resulted in a net range of plus or minus 1.0% for the combined cost of sales percentages of all commercial airplane programs. If combined cost of sales percentages for all commercial airplane programs for all of 2004 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1.0%, it would have increased or decreased income for 2004 by approximately $180 million. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments In conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (Sale Aircraft), we have entered into specified-price trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft upon the purchase of Sale Aircraft. Additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the Sale Aircraft at a specified price, generally ten years after delivery of the Sale Aircraft. Our repurchase of the Sale Aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. If, in the future, we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the Sale Aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. Based on our historical experience, we believe that very few, if any, of our outstanding contingent repurchase commitments will ultimately become trade-in commitments. 54 Table of Contents Exposure related to the trade-in of used aircraft resulting from trade-in commitments may take the form of: (1) adjustments to revenue related to the sale of new aircraft determined at the signing of a definitive agreement, and/or (2) charges to cost of products and services related to adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for new aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. The trade-in aircraft exposure related to item (2) above is recorded in ‘Accounts payable and other liabilities’ on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Obligations related to probable trade-in commitments are measured as the difference between gross amounts payable to customers and the estimated fair value of the collateral. The fair value of collateral is determined using aircraft specific data such as, model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets to which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, (1) the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage, (2) the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customer’s requirements, or (3) the scrap market. Collateral valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. This quarterly collateral valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft. Based on the best market information available at the time, it is probable that we would be obligated to perform on trade-in commitments with gross amounts payable to customers totaling $116 million and $582 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Accounts payable and other liabilities included $25 million and $65 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which represents the exposure related to these trade-in commitments. Using a measurement date of December 31, 2004, had the estimate of collateral value used to calculate our obligation related to trade-in commitments been 10% higher or lower than our actual assessment, accounts payable and other liabilities would have decreased or increased by approximately $9 million. We continually update our assessment of the likelihood of our trade-in aircraft purchase commitments and continue to monitor all these commitments for adverse developments. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in ‘Inventories’ at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in ‘Customer financing’, however, the valuation continues to be based on the lower of cost or market. The lower of cost or market assessment is performed quarterly using the process described above. Asset valuation for equipment under operating lease, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables Included in ‘Customer financing’ assets are operating lease equipment, notes receivables and sales-type/financing leases. Sales-type/financing leases are treated as receivables and allowances are established in accordance with SFAS No. 13, Accounting for Leases and SFAS No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan, as amended. We periodically assess the fair value of assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets’ carrying values. Differences between carrying values and fair values of finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral values, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables. 55 Table of Contents We use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple external equipment appraisers based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. Under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications. Impairment review for equipment under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease When events or circumstances indicate (and no less than annually), we review the carrying value of all aircraft and equipment under operating lease and held for sale or re-lease for potential impairment. In 2004, we reviewed all aircraft and equipment under operating lease and held for sale or re-lease. We evaluate assets under operating lease or held for re-lease for impairment when the expected undiscounted cash flow over the remaining useful life is less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow. These assumptions include expected future lease rates, lease terms, end of economic life value of the aircraft or equipment, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. We state assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of asset impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value less asset value guarantees, if applicable, over the fair value of the asset. For aircraft assets, we use a median calculated from the published fair values from multiple external equipment appraisers based on the type and age of the asset to determine the fair value. However, if the features or use of the aircraft varies significantly from the generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft to determine fair value. Had the fair values of these assets deemed impaired during 2004 been 10% lower at the time each specific impairment had been taken, we estimate that the assets impairment expense would have increased by approximately $9 million. We are unable to predict the magnitude or likelihood of any future impairments. Allowance for losses on receivables The allowance for losses on receivables (valuation allowance) is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio. We estimate our allowance for losses on receivables on the basis of two components of receivables: (a) specifically identified receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment, and (b) pools of receivables that are evaluated for impairment. We determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. Factors considered in assessing collectibility include, but are not limited to, a customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. We determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral. Each quarter, we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, third-party guarantees (if applicable) and third-party aircraft valuations as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates and values or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase/decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. The allocation for general purposes represents our best estimate of losses existing in the remaining receivables considering delinquencies, loss experience, collateral values, guarantees, risk of individual customer credits, published historical default rates for different rating categories, results of periodic credit reviews and the general state of the economy and airline industry. 56 Table of Contents We review the adequacy of the general allowance attributable to the remaining pool of receivables (after excluding the receivables subject to a specific allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. Collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. A receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. Prior to the third quarter of 2004, the collateral value was determined by averaging collateral values obtained from third-party equipment appraisers’ industry data. In the third quarter of 2004, we began determining the collateral value by calculating the median of those appraised values. The median value method provides a better weighted measure of aircraft collateral values. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted-average remaining contract term. Internal credit ratings are identified for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based on public information and information obtained directly from our customers. Prior to the third quarter of 2004, we based the cumulative default rate on the weighted-average remaining life of the entire portfolio. In the third quarter of 2004, we began determining the cumulative default rate for each receivable based on its weighted-average remaining life. By measuring each receivable’s weighted-average remaining life as opposed to using a portfolio average, we have increased the overall accuracy of this measurement. We have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. Should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements, would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall. In recognition of the uncertainty of the ultimate loss experience and relatively long duration of the portfolio, a range of reasonably possible outcomes of the portfolio’s credit-adjusted collateral exposure is calculated by varying the applicable default rate by approximately plus and minus 15%. The resulting range of the credit-adjusted collateral exposure as of December 31, 2004, was approximately $382 million to $413 million. We adjusted the valuation allowance to $403 million at December 31, 2004. Goodwill impairment Because our composition has changed significantly due to various acquisitions, goodwill has historically constituted a significant portion of our long-term assets. We account for our goodwill under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. This statement requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill. The SFAS No. 142 goodwill impairment model is a two-step process. First, it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations used in the first step, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. SFAS No. 142 requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually at the same date every year, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. We selected April 1 as our annual testing date. 57 Table of Contents We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions, and are subject to review and approval by our senior management and BoD. Changes in these forecasts could cause a particular operating group to either pass or fail the first step in the SFAS No. 142 goodwill impairment model, which could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded. At the date of our previous impairment test, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of our common stock would have had no impact on the financial statements. Postretirement plans We sponsor various pension plans covering substantially all employees. We also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage, to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. The liabilities and net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). Not all net periodic pension income or expense is recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and a portion remains in inventory at the end of a reporting period. We use a discount rate that is based on a point-in-time estimate as of our September 30 annual measurement date. This rate is determined based on a review of long-term, high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date and use of models that match projected benefit payments of our major U.S. pension and other postretirement plans to coupons and maturities from high quality bonds. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate would decrease the 2004 pension and other postretirement liabilities by approximately $1.3 billion (3%) and $193 million (2%), respectively, and decrease the 2004 net periodic pension expense by approximately $21 million and increase other postretirement expense $4 million, respectively. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the 2004 pension and other postretirement liabilities by approximately $1.5 billion (4%) and $213 million (3%), respectively, and increase the 2004 net periodic pension and other post-retirement expense by approximately $14 million and $1 million, respectively. Net periodic pension costs include an underlying expected long-term rate of asset return. In developing this assumption, we look at a number of factors, including asset class return by several of our trust fund investment advisors, long-term inflation assumptions, and long-term historical returns for our plans. The expected long-term rate of asset return is based on a diversified portfolio including domestic and international equities, fixed income, real estate, private equities and uncorrelated assets. Pension income or expense is especially sensitive to changes in the long-term rate of asset return. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2004 pension income by approximately $85 million. Net periodic costs for other postretirement plans include an assumption of the medical cost trend. To determine the medical trend we look at a combination of information including our future expected medical costs, recent medical costs over the past five years, and general expectations in the industry. The 2004 postretirement benefit obligation for non-pension plans reflects a small decrease in medical trend compared to the expected 2004 medical trend used in the 2003 measurement. Recent gains due to lower-than-expected increases in medical claims costs have created an unrecognized gain in 2004. 58 Table of Contents The assumed medical cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. A 100 basis point increase in assumed medical cost trend rates would increase the 2004 other postretirement liabilities by approximately $727 million. A 100 basis point decrease in assumed medical cost trend rates would decrease the 2004 other postretirement liabilities by approximately $628 million. A 100 basis point increase in assumed medical cost trend rates would increase the 2004 other postretirement costs by approximately $71 million. A 100 basis point decrease in assumed health care cost trend rates would decrease the 2004 other postretirement costs by approximately $61 million. Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs – an amendment of ARB No. 43. This Standard requires abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted material (spoilage) to be recognized as current period charges. Additionally, it requires that allocation of fixed production overhead costs be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facility. The provisions of this Standard apply prospectively and are effective for us for inventory costs incurred after January 1, 2006. While we believe this Standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements, the impact of adopting these new rules is dependent on events that could occur in future periods, and as such, an estimate of the impact cannot be determined until the event occurs in future periods. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004) (SFAS No. 123R), Shared-Based Payment. This Standard requires companies to measure share-based payments at grant-date fair value and recognize the compensation expense in their financial statements. While we previously adopted the fair value based method of accounting pursuant to SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, SFAS No. 123R changes our method of measuring compensation expense for our Performance Shares from market price to fair value at grant date and requires a forfeiture assumption for our unvested awards. Additionally, SFAS No. 123R amends the presentation of the statement of cash flows and requires additional annual disclosures. We will early adopt the provisions of SFAS No. 123R as of January 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method. We believe the impact of applying an estimated forfeiture assumption to our unvested awards will not have a material effect on our financial statements. Contingent Items Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts and other matters are pending against us. Most significant legal proceedings are related to matters covered by our insurance. Major contingencies are discussed below. Government investigations We are subject to various U.S. Government investigations, including those related to procurement activities and the alleged possession and misuse of third-party proprietary data, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted. Such proceedings involve, or could involve claims by the Government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We are also a defendant in suits filed by Lockheed Martin Corporation, ICO Global Communications, Ltd. and several of our employees. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of these disputes and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, except as set forth in Note 23 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 59 Table of Contents Other contingencies We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites discussed. Such requirements have resulted in our being involved in legal proceedings, claims and remediation obligations since the 1980s. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a settlement and of recoveries from insurance carriers. Our policy is to immediately accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites based on our best estimate within a range of potential exposure for investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred. The costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connection with such activities have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on us. With respect to results of operations, related charges have averaged less than 1% of historical annual revenues. Although not considered likely, should we be required to incur remediation charges at the high level of the range of potential exposure, the additional charges would be less than 3% of historical annual revenues. Because of the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified contaminated sites and circumstances, the potential exists for environmental remediation costs to be materially different from the estimated costs accrued for identified contaminated sites. However, based on all known facts and expert analyses, we believe it is not reasonably likely that identified environmental contingencies will result in additional costs that would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or to our operating results and cash flow trends. We have entered into standby letters of credit agreements and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $3.2 billion as of December 31, 2004 and approximately $2.4 billion at December 31, 2003. 60 Table of Contents Forward-Looking Information is Subject to Risk and Uncertainty Certain statements in this report may constitute “forward-looking” statements within the meaning of the Private Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as “expects,” “intends,” “plans,” “projects,” “believes,” “estimates,” and similar expressions are used to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Forward-looking statements are based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate. Actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in these forward-looking statements. As a result, these statements speak only as of the date they were made and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Our actual results and future trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including the continued operation, viability and growth of major airline customers and non-airline customers (such as the U.S. Government); adverse developments in the value of collateral securing customer and other financings; the occurrence of any significant collective bargaining labor dispute; our successful execution of internal performance plans, production rate increases and decreases (including any reduction in or termination of an aircraft product), acquisition and divestiture plans, and other cost-reduction and productivity efforts; charges from any future SFAS No. 142 review; an adverse development in rating agency credit ratings or assessments; the actual outcomes of certain pending sales campaigns and the launch of the 787 program and U.S. and foreign government procurement activities, including the uncertainty associated with the procurement of tankers by the U.S. DoD; the cyclical nature of some of our businesses; unanticipated financial market changes which may impact pension plan assumptions; domestic and international competition in the defense, space and commercial areas; continued integration of acquired businesses; performance issues with key suppliers, subcontractors and customers; significant disruption to air travel worldwide (including future terrorist attacks); global trade policies; worldwide political stability; domestic and international economic conditions; price escalation; the outcome of political and legal processes, changing priorities or reductions in the U.S. Government or foreign government defense and space budgets; termination of government or commercial contracts due to unilateral government or customer action or failure to perform; legal, financial and governmental risks related to international transactions; legal and investigatory proceedings; tax settlements with the IRS and various states; USAF review of previously awarded contracts; and other economic, political and technological risks and uncertainties. Additional information regarding these factors is contained in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and Sept. 30, 2004. 61 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally short-term investments, fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses due to interest rate changes. Additionally, we use interest rate swaps to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Based on the current holdings of short-term investments, as well as related swaps, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material for these instruments. The investors in the fixed-rate debt obligations that we issue, generally do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. BCC’s assets and liabilities, both fixed-rate and floating-rate, may be subject to interest rate risk to the extent that the maturities and repricing characteristics of the liabilities do not perfectly match those of the assets. The types and terms of borrowing and hedging instruments that are available to BCC in the market and possible changes in asset terms limit BCC’s ability to match assets and liabilities. BCC attempts to minimize this risk, partly through the use of interest rate swaps, and does not believe it is materially exposed to gains or losses due to interest rate changes. BCC has used public market information and common valuation methods to determine the fair value of its assets and liabilities. The estimates are not necessarily indicative of the amounts BCC could realize in a current market exchange, and the use of different assumptions or valuation methods could have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts. At December 31, 2004, the book values of BCC’s assets and liabilities were approximately $10.3 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively. BCC measures and manages its interest rate risk by estimating the potential changes in twelve-month net interest income and in the current discounted value of the assets and liabilities based on the cash flows projected from each. At December 31, 2004, we estimated that if market interest rates for all maturities were affected by an immediate, one-time, 100-basis-point increase, BCC’s net earnings, taking into account increases in both revenue and interest expense, would have changed by an amount that is immaterial to the results of operations. Additionally, although the assets and liabilities impacted by a change in interest rates are generally not traded, BCC estimated that the net present value of these assets and liabilities would have changed by an amount that is immaterial to its financial position. Foreign currency exchange rate risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business and operational financing activities. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2004, a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental unrealized loss of $60.0 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. Commodity price risk We are subject to commodity price risk relating principally to energy used in production. We periodically use commodity derivatives, such as fixed-price purchase commitments, to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes of commodities. Commodity price exposure related to unhedged contracts is not material. 62 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:47.022852
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2006,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacturing, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and the second-largest defense contractor in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors located around the world. Our business strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes and Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses generate substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services and to open new frontiers in aerospace. We are focused on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. IDS is a defense systems business that integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to overlay the strong positions in Commercial Airplanes and IDS with a simultaneously intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as commercial and defense markets often offset each others’ cyclicality. BCC delivers value through supporting our business units and reducing our customer financing exposures. Boeing Technology, our advanced research and development unit, provides new systems, technologies and processes to position us for future growth. Connexion by BoeingSM makes an airplane seem more like the office or home with internet connection anytime and anywhere. Our financial results improved significantly in 2005 over 2004. Revenues grew by 5 percent, operating earnings grew by 40%, operating margin increased by 1.3 percentage points and fully diluted earnings per share grew by 39%. We continued to invest in key growth programs and Research and Development expense grew by 17% to $2.2 billion, primarily reflecting increased spending on our new 787 aircraft. We generated operating cash flow of $7.0 billion after contributing $1.9 billion to our pension plans. We reduced debt by $1.5 billion and repurchased more than 45 million shares. Our contractual backlog grew 46% to $160 billion, driven by 76% growth at Commercial Airplanes while our total backlog grew 30% to $205 billion. Our major businesses delivered strong performance in 2005. Commercial Airplanes grew revenues by 8% to $22.7 billion while operating earnings increased by 90% to $1.4 billion or 6.3% of revenues compared with operating margins of 3.6% of revenues in 2004. IDS revenues grew by 1% to a record $30.8 billion, operating earnings increased 33% to $3.9 billion and operating earnings as a percent of revenues were 12.6% in 2005 up from 9.6% in 2004. A gain of $569 million from the sale of Rocketdyne in 2005 increased IDS operating margin by 1.8%. BCC grew revenue by 1% and increased operating earnings by 27%. The operating earnings growth at our major businesses was partially offset by higher expenses for pension and share-based plans. We expect strong growth in Commercial Airplane revenues and deliveries as we execute our record backlog and respond to global demand. We are ramping up commercial aircraft production and are focused on successfully executing our backlog. We expect IDS revenue growth to moderate as we anticipate that the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) budget will remain relatively flat over the next several years. We are focused on improving financial performance through a combination of productivity and customer-focused growth. 19 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues Higher consolidated revenues in 2005 were primarily due to the growth at Commercial Airplanes driven by higher new aircraft deliveries, increased spares and aircraft modifications, and higher used aircraft sales. IDS revenues remained stable in 2005 after strong growth in 2004. BCC revenues were essentially unchanged in 2005. Consolidated revenues also increased in 2004 as compared to 2003. The increase was driven by strong growth at IDS defense and intelligence businesses. Despite increased new aircraft deliveries, Commercial Airplanes revenues declined in 2004. The decline is primarily due to delivery mix as more single-aisle aircraft and fewer twin-aisle aircraft were delivered in 2004. BCC revenues were down slightly in 2004. Operating Earnings Our 2005 operating earnings increased primarily due to strong operating performance by our business segments, which are discussed in the Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition on page 27, partially offset by higher pension and share-based plan expenses. Sharply higher operating earnings in 2004 compared to 2003 were primarily due to higher operating earnings by IDS. Included in 2004 results is a charge of $555 million related to the United States Air Force (USAF) 767 tanker program and expenses incurred to end production of the 717 aircraft. Included in 2003 results are goodwill impairment charges of $572 million recorded at IDS and $341 million recorded at Commercial Airplanes. In addition, 2003 earnings were further impacted by a second quarter charge of $1,030 million, of which $835 million was attributable to the Delta IV program and $195 million to Boeing Satellite Systems incurring additional costs as a result of satellite program complexities. The following table shows operating earnings and corporate items not allocated to our segments: (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Commercial Airplanes $ 1,432 $ 753 $ 707 Integrated Defense Systems 3,890 2,925 766 Boeing Capital Corporation 232 183 91 Other segment (334 ) (535 ) (379 ) Items not allocated to segments (2,408 ) (1,319 ) (787 ) Earnings from continuing operations $ 2,812 $ 2,007 $ 398 The most significant items not allocated to segments are shown in the following table: Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Pension and post-retirement (expense)/income $ (851 ) $ (258 ) $ 206 Share-based plans expense (852 ) (576 ) (456 ) Deferred compensation expense (265 ) (72 ) (68 ) Other (440 ) (413 ) (469 ) Total items not allocated to segments $ (2,408 ) $ (1,319 ) $ (787 ) Pension and other post-retirement accounting differences represent difference between costs recognized under GAAP in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. Higher pension and post-retirement amounts in 2005 are primarily related to higher amortization of actuarial losses and net settlement and curtailment losses due to 2005 divestitures. The increase in 2004 from 2003 is due to higher GAAP pension expense in 2004 reflecting higher amortization of 20 Table of Contents actuarial losses. The increase in 2005 share-based plans expense is primarily due to the increase in our stock price which resulted in additional compensation expense due to an increase in the number of performance shares meeting the price growth targets and being converted to common stock. The increase in 2005 deferred compensation plans expense is also due to the increase in our stock price. Income Taxes The 2005 effective income tax rate of 9.1% differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35%, primarily due to a settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years 1998-2001, Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) and Extraterritorial Income (ETI) tax benefits, reversal of valuation allowances, and other provision adjustments. The 2004 effective income tax rate of 7.1% differed from the federal statutory tax rate of 35%, due to FSC and ETI tax benefits, tax benefits from a settlement with the IRS for the years 1986-1997, tax benefits associated with state tax audit settlements, and other provision adjustments. For further discussion related to Income Taxes see Note 5. Net Earnings Net earnings increased in 2005 compared to 2004 largely due to higher operating earnings. Interest and debt expense was lower as we continued to pay down our debt in 2005. Net earnings increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to higher operating earnings which was partially offset by lower other income and higher income taxes. Additionally, included in 2004 net earnings is a $42 million net gain on BCC’s sale of a substantial portion of its Commercial Financial Services business. Other income primarily consists of interest income. Other income included interest of $100 million in 2005, $219 million in 2004 and $397 million in 2003 related to federal income tax settlements for prior years. Additionally in 2005, other income included higher income from marketable securities and an asset impairment charge for certain investments in technology related funds and partnerships. We early adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 123R as of January 1, 2005 using the modified prospective method. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 123R, we recorded an increase in net earnings of $21 million, net of taxes of $12 million, as a cumulative effect of accounting change. For Performance Shares awarded in 2005, the fair value of each award is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model instead of the grant date market price used for previous awards. Additionally, we now amortize compensation cost for share-based awards granted after January 1, 2005 for retirement eligible employees using the non-substantive vesting approach instead of amortizing over the stated vesting period (See Note 18). Backlog Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and foreign government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog from 2004 to 2005 primarily relates to new orders for the 737, 777, and 787. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in IDS contractual backlog. The increase in contractual backlog from 2003 to 2004 related primarily to new orders for the 777 and 787. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in IDS contractual backlog. 21 Table of Contents Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and foreign government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2005 is mainly due to strong sales in C-17 and F-15 programs for multi-year contracts awarded in prior years. For segment reporting purposes, we include airplanes ordered by other segments in Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog. Commercial Airplanes relieves contractual backlog upon delivery of these airplanes to other segments. IDS contractual backlog includes modifications to be performed on intracompany airplane purchases from Commercial Airplanes. IDS contractual backlog is reduced upon delivery to the customer or at the attainment of performance milestones. Liquidity and Capital Resources The primary sources of our liquidity and capital resources include cash flow from operations and substantial unused borrowing capacity through commercial paper programs, long-term capital markets and revolving credit line agreements. The primary factors that affect our investment requirements and liquidity position, other than operating results associated with current sales activity, include the following: timing of new and derivative aircraft programs requiring both high developmental expenditures and initial inventory buildup; growth and contractions in business cycles; customer financing assistance; the timing of federal income tax payments/refunds and contributions to our pension plans as well as interest, debt and dividend payments; our stock repurchase plan; internal investments; and acquisitions and divestitures. Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net earnings $ 2,572 $ 1,872 $ 718 Non-cash items 3,310 3,047 3,137 Changes in working capital 1,118 (1,415) (1,079) Net cash provided by operating activities 7,000 3,504 2,776 Net cash (used)/ provided by investing activities (98 ) (1,446 ) 60 Net cash used by financing activities (4,657) (3,487) (536) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (37 ) Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 2,208 (1,429 ) 2,300 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 3,204 4,633 2,333 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 5,412 $ 3,204 $ 4,633 Non-cash items Non-cash items in earnings primarily include depreciation, share-based plans expense, impairments, pension expense, and gains/losses on dispositions. Corresponding amounts are listed in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Working capital During the year ended December 31, 2005, our investment in working capital decreased. This decrease is primarily due to the following: · lower pension contributions in 2005 compared to 2004, · decreased investment in customer financing, and · higher advances and billings in excess of related costs. These decreases in working capital were partially offset by increased investment in inventories. 22 Table of Contents Working capital includes customer financing transactions primarily in the form of notes receivable, sales-type/finance leases and property subject to operating leases. These transactions occur as the result of customer financing activities associated with items recorded in inventory. The origination and subsequent principal collections for some of these transactions were previously presented as investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, consistent with the presentation by BCC in their stand alone financial statements. Effective for the year ended December 31, 2004, we changed the classification of the cash flow effects of customer financing transactions based on views expressed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) staff. The amounts for prior periods have been reclassified to be consistent with current year presentation. For the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the net impact on operating cash flow was $589 million, ($421) million and ($1.3) billion, respectively, for customer financing transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we received federal income tax refunds totaling $738 million (of which $145 million represents interest). These refunds related to the settlement of federal income tax audits for the 1987-2001 tax years. For the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, we contributed $1.9 billion and $4.4 billion to our pension plans which are included in operating cash flow. Almost all of the 2005 and 2004 contributions were voluntary to improve the funded status of our plans. Investing activities In 2005, cash used for investing activities decreased by $1.3 billion compared to 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher net contributions in 2004 to investment grade fixed income securities partially offset by lower proceeds from business dispositions in 2005 and higher Property, plant and equipment additions in 2005. During 2004, we invested $3.0 billion of cash in an externally managed portfolio of investment grade fixed income instruments. The portfolio is diversified and highly liquid and primarily consists of investment fixed income instruments (U.S. dollar debt obligations of the United States Treasury, other government agencies, corporations, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities). As of December 31, 2005, the portfolio had an average duration of 1.6 years. We do not intend to hold these investments to maturity, nor do we intend to actively and frequently buy and sell these securities with the objective of generating profits on short-term differences in price. During 2005, we received $1.7 billion of cash proceeds from dispositions. This is primarily related to the sale of our Commercial Airplanes operations in Wichita, Kansas, and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma and the sale of Rocketdyne. During 2004, we received cash of $2.0 billion from the sale of a substantial portion of BCC’s Commercial Financial Services business. Property, plant and equipment additions increased by approximately $0.3 billion to $1.5 billion in 2005. Financing activities Cash used by financing activities increased to $4.6 billion in 2005 from $3.5 billion in 2004 primarily due to a $2.1 billion increase in share repurchases partially offset by lower debt repayments. During 2005, we repurchased 45,217,300 shares at an average price of $63.60 pursuant to our open market share repurchase program, and 33,360 shares in stock swaps. During 2004, 14,708,856 shares were repurchased at an average price of $51.09 pursuant to our open market share repurchase program, and 50,657 shares were repurchased in stock swaps. There were no share repurchases in 2003. There were no debt issuances during 2005 and 2004. We issued approximately $1 billion of debt in 2003 to refinance corporate debt that matured in 2002 and 2003. Additionally, in 2003, we received proceeds of $1 billion under our September 13, 2002 shelf registration. On July 26, 2004, BCC redeemed $1 billion face value of its outstanding senior notes, which had a carrying value of $999 million. BCC recognized a net loss of $42 million related to this early debt redemption (See Note 16). Debt maturities were $1.3 billion in 2005, $1.1 billion in 2004, and $1.8 billion in 2003. 23 Table of Contents Credit Ratings Our credit ratings are summarized below: Fitch Moody’s Standard &Poor’s Long-term: Boeing/BCC A+ A3 A Short-term: Boeing/BCC F-1 P-2 A-1 On January 25, 2006, Moody’s placed both Boeing and BCC’s credit ratings (Senior Unsecured Long-term ratings and Short-term ratings) under review for possible upgrade. Capital Resources We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2005 and at December 31, 2005, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. We believe we have substantial borrowing capacity. Currently, we have $3.0 billion ($1.5 billion exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing limits under revolving credit line agreements. (See Note 16). In November 2005, we rolled over the 364-day revolving credit facility, reducing it from $2.0 billion to $1.5 billion. Currently, there is $750 million allocated to BCC. We also rolled over the 5-year credit facility we established in November 2003, maintaining the total size of $1.5 billion, of which $750 million remains allocated to BCC. We also have $1.0 billion that remains available from a shelf registration filed with the SEC on March 23, 2004 and BCC has an additional $3.4 billion available for issuance. We believe our internally generated liquidity, together with access to external capital resources, will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. As of December 31, 2005, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. 24 Table of Contents Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2005, and the estimated timing thereof. Contractual obligations (Dollars in millions) Total Less than1 year 1–3years 3–5years After 5years Long-term debt (including current portion) $ 10,489 $ 1,136 $ 2,018 $ 1,194 $ 6,141 Interest on debt* 6,859 638 1,067 913 4,241 Capital lease obligations 210 53 87 18 52 Operating lease obligations 1,995 283 381 260 1,071 Purchase obligations not recorded on statement of financial position: Production related 58,532 24,599 22,060 9,169 2,704 Pension and other post retirement cash requirements 6,847 629 1,349 1,446 3,423 Purchase obligations recorded on statement of financial position 7,952 6,625 455 467 405 Total contractual obligations $ 92,884 $ 33,963 $ 27,417 $ 13,467 $ 18,037 * Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2005. Variable rate debt was approximately 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2005. Purchase obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, the agreements are not cancelable without a substantial penalty. Long-term debt, interest on debt, capital leases, and operating leases are shown in the above table regardless of whether they meet the characteristics of purchase obligations. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the statements of financial position. Approximately 24% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Pension and other postretirement benefits Pension cash requirements is an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to the ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contribution to the one plan that is funded through a trust. Production related Production related purchase obligations include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises due to the extended production planning horizon for many of our products, including commercial aircraft, military aircraft and other products where 25 Table of Contents delivery to the customer occurs over an extended period of time. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts from customers, and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from such customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Industrial participation agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers in foreign countries to effect economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies, as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology, or other forms of assistance to the foreign country. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our foreign customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2005, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2005, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $6.3 billion that extend through 2019. In cases where we satisfy our commitments through the purchase of supplies and the criteria described in “purchase obligations” are met, amounts are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, the foreign country or customer must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the statement of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees and variable interests in unconsolidated entities. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 21. Commercial commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2005, as well as an estimate of when these commitments are expected to expire. (Dollars in millions) Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $ 3,957 $ 3,719 $ 112 $ – $ 126 Aircraft financing commercial commitments 13,496 872 6,672 1,997 3,955 Total commercial commitments $ 17,453 $ 4,591 $ 6,784 $ 1,997 $ 4,081 Related to the issuance of certain standby letters of credit and surety bonds included in the above table, we received advance payments of $274 million as of December 31, 2005. 26 Table of Contents Aircraft financing commercial commitments include commitments to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order or under option for deliveries scheduled through the year 2012. Based on historical experience, it is not anticipated that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers. (See Note 21). Industrial Revenue Bonds We utilize Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita, Kansas and Fulton County, Georgia to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property (See Note 21). Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Gross domestic product (GDP) growth, the primary driver of air traffic growth, remained resilient in the face of rising energy prices in 2005. As a result, worldwide passenger traffic growth continued above the long-term trend in 2005 following double digit growth in 2004. Traffic growth outpaced capacity increases pushing world load factors to historical highs. Industry forecasts predict above average traffic growth through at least 2007, although disease outbreaks, increasing armed conflict or terrorist attacks, and global economic imbalances represent ongoing risks. Crude oil prices have almost doubled since the beginning of 2004. In addition, the price differential between oil and jet fuel rose to historically high levels in 2005, triple the average over the last 20 years. Although economic indicators show that the world economy has adjusted to the current higher oil price levels without significant slowdown, the rise in jet fuel prices is outpacing airlines’ ability to increase revenues through fare hikes and fuel surcharges and is pressuring less efficient airlines in particular. Worldwide, many airlines continue to report operating profits although performance varies significantly by region and business model. Industry financials generally show increasing unit revenues and some improvement in fares. Combined with progress on cost-cutting initiatives and efficiency improvements, these trends are helping many airlines remain profitable despite rising fuel prices and intense competition. Although the industry’s aggregate financial health remains under the shadow of the U.S. network carriers whose financial difficulties are forecast to push the industry into losses of $6 billion in 2005, the many airlines that are profitably growing to meet increased demand are acquiring new capacity from manufacturers. The pace of air traffic rights liberalization between countries has been brisk during the past year with many new air service agreements having been signed or announced. High growth markets including China and India announced multiple new agreements spurring the opening of new routes. In addition, the United States and European Union made significant advances towards “open skies” late in 2005. Continued liberalization is an important factor in the growth and network development of commercial aviation. Looking forward, our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger traffic, and 6% per year for cargo traffic based on projected average annual worldwide real economic growth of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in the increasingly competitive environment, increasing utilization levels of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $2.1 trillion market for 25,700 new airplanes over the next 20 years. While factors such as terrorism and increased ticket charges for security have had significant impact over the span of several years, they have not historically affected the longer-term macro trends in the world economy, and therefore, our long-term market outlook. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long-term downward trend in passenger revenue yields 27 Table of Contents worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has continued to enable low-cost airlines to gain market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately two-thirds of Commercial Airplanes’ third-party sales and contractual backlog are from customers based outside the United States. We face aggressive international competitors that are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. The decline of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies in 2004 put pressure on competitors’ revenues and profits. Competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. Airbus is implementing such initiatives targeting more than 10% reduction in costs by 2006. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen as it has in 2005, Airbus can use the extra efficiency to develop new products and gain market share. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network for airlines throughout the world to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively and maintain satisfactory margins. While we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction activities, events may occur that will prevent us from achieving planned results. We continue to explore strategic options related to our operations at various sites to focus on large-scale systems integration, which is where we are most competitive and can add the most value to our airplanes and services. Production Disruption Caused by Labor Strike We delivered 29 fewer than expected airplanes due to the IAM strike, during 2005. This reduced revenue by approximately $2 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2005. New Airline Bankruptcies Northwest Airlines, Inc. (Northwest) and Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on September 14, 2005. Commercial Airplanes does not expect a material impact on revenues or operating results due to these bankruptcy filings. (See Note 10). Divestitures On June 16, 2005 we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets at our Commercial Airplanes facilities in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma under an asset purchase agreement to a new entity, which was subsequently named Spirit Aerosystems, Inc. (Spirit) and is owned by Onex Partners LP. (See Note 8). 28 Table of Contents Operating Results (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 22,651 $ 21,037 $ 22,408 % of Total Company Revenues 41 % 40 % 44 % Operating Earnings $ 1,432 $ 753 $ 707 Operating Margins 6.3 % 3.6 % 3.2 % Research and Development $ 1,302 $ 941 $ 676 Contractual Backlog* $ 124,132 $ 70,449 $ 63,929 * Note: Commercial Airplanes backlog at December 31, 2005 has been reduced by $7.8 billion to reflect the planned change in accounting for concessions effective January 1, 2006. Had December 31, 2004 reflected this method of accounting, Commercial Airplanes contractual backlog would have been reduced by $4.9 billion to $65.5 billion. See Note 1. Revenues The increase in revenue of approximately $1.6 billion in 2005 from 2004 was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries including model mix changes of $1.0 billion, used airplane sales of $302 million and aircraft modification, spares and other of $300 million. The decline in revenue of $1.4 billion in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily due to new airplane model mix of $1.2 billion and net reductions of $132 million in other products. Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31, including deliveries under operating lease, which are identified by parentheses, were as follows: Model 2005 2004 2003 717 13 (5) 12 (6) 12 (11) 737 Next-Generation 212 * 202 * 173 * 747 13 15 19 (1) 757 2 11 14 767 10 * 9 (1) 24 (5) 777 40 36 39 Total 290 285 281 * Intracompany deliveries were two 767 aircraft and two 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2005, three 737 Next-Generation aircraft in 2004 and three 737 Next-Generation aircraft in 2003 The cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: Model 2005 2004 2003 717 150 137 125 737 Next-Generation 1,834 1,622 1,420 747 1,366 1,353 1,338 757 1,049 1,047 1,036 767 935 925 916 777 539 499 463 29 Table of Contents The undelivered units under firm order* as of December 31 were as follows: Model 2005 2004 2003 717 5 18 22 737 Next-Generation 1,123 771 800 747 58 27 32 757 2 13 767 30 25 25 777 288 167 159 787 287 52 * Firm orders represent new aircraft purchase agreements where the customers’ rights to cancel without penalty have expired. Typically customer rights to cancel without penalty include the customer receiving approval from its Board of Directors, shareholders, government and completing financing arrangements. All such cancellation rights must be satisfied or expired prior to recording a firm order even if satisfying such conditions are highly certain. Firm orders exclude option aircraft and aircraft with cancellation rights. Operating earnings The $679 million increase in operating earnings in 2005 over the comparable period of 2004 was primarily attributable to earnings on increased revenue from new aircraft deliveries of $265 million and increased revenue from aircraft modification and other of $128 million. In addition, margin improved $414 million mainly due to improved cost performance, which was offset by increased research and development costs of $361 million and other period costs of $174 million, and a loss on the sale of Wichita, Tulsa and McAlester operations of $68 million. In 2004, we also had charges of $280 million resulting from the decision to complete production of the 717 program and $195 million of 767 USAF Tanker program charge. Refer to IDS Discussion on page 37. The increase of $46 million in operating earnings in 2004 from 2003 was primarily attributable to $466 million from improved program margins due to cost reduction initiatives and decreased period costs offset by lower earnings from the change in model mix of $205 million, 717 program termination charge of $280 million, 767 USAF Tanker program charge of $195 million and increased research and development expense of $265 million. Additionally, in 2003 we had a goodwill impairment charge of $341 million and a charge of $184 million resulting from the decision to complete production of the 757 program. Backlog The increase in backlog in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily relates to new orders for the 737, 777 and 787. The increase in backlog in 2004 compared to 2003 was primarily related to new orders for 777 and 787. Accounting Quantity For each airplane program, we estimate the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. We refer to this estimate as the “accounting quantity.” The accounting quantity for each program is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout the life of a program. See “Application of Critical Accounting Policies-Program accounting.” Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. We review and reassess our program accounting quantities on a quarterly basis in compliance with relevant program accounting guidance. Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which do not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting 30 Table of Contents quantity decreases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also decreases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates, thus increasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. The estimate of total program accounting quantities and changes, if any, as of December 31 were: 717 737 Next-Generation 747 757 767 777 2005 156 2,800 1,424 1,050 971 800 Additions 400 24 12 100 2004 156 2,400 1,400 1,050 959 700 Additions/(deletions) 8 200 12 (16 ) 50 2003 148 2,200 1,388 1,050 975 650 The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be addressed. The percentage of anticipated orders included in the program accounting estimates as compared to the number of cumulative firm orders* as of December 31 were as follows: 717 737 Next- Generation 747 757 767 777 2005 Cumulative firm orders (CFO) 155 2,957 1,424 1,049 965 827 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A 3 N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 0 % N/A 2004 Cumulative firm orders 155 2,393 1,380 1,049 950 666 Anticipated orders N/A 5 19 N/A 6 34 Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A 0 % 1 % N/A 1 % 5 % 2003 Cumulative firm orders 147 2,220 1,370 1,049 941 622 Anticipated orders N/A N/A 17 N/A 32 28 Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A 1 % N/A 3 % 5 % * Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered units under firm order (see tables in Commercial Airplanes Revenues/Operating Results discussion). Cumulative firm orders include orders that fall within the current accounting quantities as well as orders that extend beyond the current accounting quantities. Cumulative firm orders exclude program test aircraft that will not be refurbished for sale. 717 Program The accounting quantity for the 717 program has been based on firm orders since the fourth quarter of 2001. As of December 31, 2005, of the 5 remaining undelivered units, 3 units will be delivered to a single customer with uncertain financial condition. As a result, on a consolidated basis, these aircraft will be accounted for under long-term operating leases as they are delivered. The value of the inventory for the undelivered aircraft as of December 31, 2005, remained realizable. On January 12, 2005, we announced our decision to complete production of the 717 airplane in 2006 due to the lack of overall market demand for the airplane. The decision is expected to result in total pre-tax charges of approximately $380 million, of which $280 million was incorporated in 2004 fourth quarter and year end results. The last 717 aircraft is expected to be delivered in the second quarter of 2006. See Note 24. 31 Table of Contents 737 Next-Generation The accounting quantity for the 737 Next-Generation program increased by 400 units during 2005 as a result of the programs’ normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. 747 Program The 747 program accounting quantity was increased by 24 units during 2005 as a result of additional customer orders. In November 2005, we launched the 747 Advanced as the 747-8 family, which includes 747-8 International passenger airplane and the 747-8 Freighter. This launch and additional anticipated firm orders have extended the life of this program and have also solidified product strategy. 757 Program Due to lack of demand for the 757 program, a decision was made in the third quarter of 2003 to complete production of the program. Production of the 757 program ended in October 2004. The last aircraft was delivered in the second quarter of 2005. The vendor termination liability remaining in Accounts payable and other liabilities was reduced from $121 million to $62 million during 2005 due to $73 million in payments offset by an increase in estimate of $14 million. No future charges related to the 757 airplane program are expected. 767 Program During 2005 the 767 achieved some success in obtaining additional orders. As a result the accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by twelve units during 2005. Given the timing and changing requirements for new USAF tankers, the prospects for the current 767 production program to extend uninterrupted into a USAF tanker contract has diminished. We are continuing to pursue market opportunities for additional 767 sales. Despite the recent airplane orders and the possibility of additional orders, it is still reasonably possible a decision to complete production could be made in 2006. A forward loss is not expected as a result of such a decision but program margins would be reduced. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 100 units during 2005 as a result of the program’s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. In May 2005 we launched the 777-Freighter. Deferred production costs Commercial aircraft inventory production costs incurred on in-process and delivered units in excess of the estimated average cost of such units, determined as described in Note 1 represent deferred production costs. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004 deferred production costs relate to the 777 program and there were no significant excess deferred production costs or unamortized tooling costs not recoverable from existing firm orders. The deferred production costs and unamortized tooling included in the 777 program’s inventory at December 31 are summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 Deferred production costs $ 683 $ 703 Unamortized tooling 411 485 As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, the balance of deferred production costs and unamortized tooling related to all other commercial aircraft programs was insignificant relative to the programs’ balance-to-go cost estimates. Fleet support We provide the operators of all our commercial airplane models assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. Fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the 32 Table of Contents customer receives training, manuals and technical consulting support, and continues throughout the operational life of the aircraft. Services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire model’s fleet. Field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. Research and development We continually evaluate opportunities to improve current aircraft models, and assess the marketplace to ensure that our family of commercial jet aircraft is well positioned to meet future requirements of the airline industry. The fundamental strategy is to maintain a broad product line that is responsive to changing market conditions by maximizing commonality among our family of commercial aircraft. Additionally, we are determined to continue to lead the industry in customer satisfaction by offering products with the highest standards of quality, safety, technical excellence, economic performance and in-service support. Our Research and Development spending increased $361 million during 2005 and $265 million in 2004. The increase in research and development during 2005 and 2004 was primarily due to increased spending on the 787 program and was partially offset by supplier development cost sharing payments. For 2005, 787 supplier development cost sharing payments received were $611 million compared to $205 million during 2004. We expect to receive a lesser amount of 787 supplier development cost sharing payments in 2006, which will result in an increase to our total research and development expense. We are currently focusing our new airplane product development efforts on the 787 program, which in three planned versions will seat 223 to 296 passengers in multiple class configurations. In early 2004, we received the initial launch order for the 787 and Board of Directors (BoD) approval to proceed with full development and production. Entry into service is targeted for 2008. We are also continuing to develop derivatives and features for our other programs primarily the 737, 747-8 and 777 programs. The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Integrated Defense Systems Business Environment and Trends IDS is organized into four financial reporting segments: A&WS, Network Systems, Support Systems, and L&OS. The first three segments primarily address the U. S. defense market and other limited 33 Table of Contents defense spending worldwide. The fourth segment is focused on the civil and commercial space markets along with the defense market for launch capabilities. On January 27, 2006 we announced in response to a changing market and emerging defense requirements that the IDS segments will be consolidated into three capabilities-driven businesses: Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems, Networks and Space Systems, and Support Systems. In addition, a new Advanced Systems unit has been created. Operations will be consolidated into three business profit and loss centers organized around capabilities. Defense Environment Overview The U.S. is faced with continuous force deployments overseas, stability operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the requirement both to recapitalize important defense capabilities and to transform the force to take advantage of available technologies to meet the changing national security environment as outlined in the recently released 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) Report. All of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant Federal budget deficits and an administration pledge to reduce and ultimately eliminate annual deficit spending. We anticipate that the national security environment will remain challenging for at least the next decade. The global war on terrorism and the national security threats posed by weapons of mass destruction demand new and improved capabilities such as persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), global precision strike, and assured access to space. Recent operations in support of the global war on terrorism have demonstrated the value of networked and fused ISR combined with advanced command, control and communications systems; interdependence across platforms, services, and Special Forces; and the leveraging effects of precise, persistent, and selective engagement. All of these enable and leverage new capabilities while allowing use of traditional capabilities more discretely and in new ways. The significance and advantage of unmanned systems to perform many of these tasks will continue to be investigated. There is also recognition that technology must be coupled with human intelligence and ground forces to generate the greatest effect. These opportunities and challenges are driving the U. S. Department of Defense (DoD), along with militaries worldwide, both friend and potential foe, to transform their forces and weapons systems as well as the way they use them. Because DoD spending makes up about half of worldwide defense spending and represented greater than 90% of IDS revenue in 2005, the trends and drivers associated with the DoD budget are critical. The DoD budget has grown substantially over the past decade, particularly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and we’ve seen that trend continue in the 2007 Presidential budget submittal, although at a moderated rate compared to the last few years. The President’s request for fiscal year 2007 is $439.3 billion, excluding supplemental appropriations required by ongoing military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. This is a 7% increase over the enacted fiscal year 2006 funding level of $410.8 billion. Although the top-line had continued to experience growth in the last couple of years, we had seen pressure on the investment accounts (Procurement and Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E)). The portion of the defense budget allocated to DoD procurement decreased between fiscal year 2004 and 2005 and again in 2006. Conversely, in the 2007 Presidential Budget request, the procurement account increased by about 10% and the RDT&E account increased by slightly more than 3% when compared to the enacted 2006 funding levels. (All projections and percentage increases are made without taking inflation into account.) We anticipate that the overall DoD budget will remain in the range of the 2007 request or slightly lower over the next four to five years. Even though we continue to see some growth in the DoD budget, it is unlikely that the DoD will be able to fully fund the hardware programs already in development as well as new initiatives in order to address the capability gaps identified in the 2006 QDR. This imbalance between future costs of hardware programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the DoD and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules, restructuring programs, and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding. 34 Table of Contents We expect the DoD will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies that emphasize jointness, network-centric operations, persistent ISR, long-range strike, special operations, unmanned systems, precision guided kinetic and non-kinetic weapons, and continued privatization of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. Evolving national challenges will be met by reallocating funds within the Department. This will provide opportunities for IDS products in the future. We are already seeing the need for the military to make difficult choices between programs in an effort to fill their highest priority capability gaps. The DoD is also expected to continue to examine the force structure, including personnel and equipment requirements, in search of opportunities to improve business processes and reduce overall manpower. Programs will continually be evaluated by performance and relevancy relative to required DoD capabilities and enduring needs. Civil Space Transportation and Exploration Environment Congress approved close to full funding of NASA’s fiscal year 2005 and 2006 budget requests, including needed funds for Space Shuttle Operations, International Space Station, and new initiatives associated with the Vision for Space Exploration. NASA’s fiscal year 2006 appropriation of $16.6 billion is approximately equal to the fiscal year 2005 funding level. Funding at this level or a slightly higher is projected into the future as evidenced by the 2007 Presidential Budget request of $16.8 billion. NASA is continuing to pursue elements of the Vision for Space Exploration, which will provide additional opportunities. Commercial Space Environment The commercial space market has softened significantly since the late 1990s in conjunction with the downturn in the telecommunications industry. This market is now characterized by overcapacity, aggressive pricing and limited near-term opportunities. Recent projections indicate these market conditions will persist until the end of this decade. We believe there will be fewer commercial satellite orders for the next few years with a slight upturn to meet replacement demand near the end of the decade, but we do not project recovery equal to the demand of the early to mid 1990s. In this extremely limited market, we see continued manufacturing overcapacity, which in turn is driving continued deterioration of pricing conditions. We will continue to pursue profitable commercial satellite opportunities where the customer values our technical expertise and unique solutions (e.g., DirecTV and Mobile Satellite Ventures). In the launch market, we continue to focus our Delta IV program on the government launch market only, but we offer the capabilities of the Sea Launch system, described below, in the commercial launch area. Sea Launch The Sea Launch venture, in which we are a 40% partner, provides ocean-based launch services to commercial satellite customers and is reported in the L&OS segment. For the year ended December 31, 2005, the venture conducted four successful launches. We have issued credit guarantees to creditors of the Sea Launch venture to assist the venture in obtaining financing. In the event we are required to perform on these guarantees, we have the right to recover a portion of the cost from other venture partners. We believe our net exposure to loss from Sea Launch at December 31, 2005 totals $125 million. The components of this exposure are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) MaximumExposure EstablishedReserves EstimatedProceedsfromRecourse NetExposure Credit Guarantees $ 490 $ 196 $ 294 Partner Loans (Principal and Interest) 425 255 170 Advances to Provide for Future Launches 123 11 $ 112 Trade Receivable from Sea Launch 246 246 Performance Guarantees 35 1 21 13 Other Receivables from Sea Launch 36 36 $ 1,355 $ 734 $ 496 $ 125 35 Table of Contents We made no additional capital contributions to the Sea Launch venture during the year ended December 31, 2005. Delta The USAF lifted the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) suspension on March 4, 2005. (See Note 24.) After this action, we were awarded a contract to provide infrastructure sustainment related to Delta IV launches. In addition, on June 20, 2005 we submitted a proposal in response to the initial Request for Proposals for the EELV Buy III program. Buy III contracts are expected to be issued to us and Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) and may ultimately include up to 24 launches and additional infrastructure sustainment funding. The cost estimates for the Delta II and Delta IV programs are based in part upon estimated quantities and timing of launch missions for existing and anticipated contracts, referred to as the Mission Manifest, to determine the allocation of fixed costs to individual launches. Revenue estimates include probable price adjustments due to contractual statement of work changes where we have established contractual entitlement. If these price adjustments do not occur, it could impact the financial performance of the Delta programs. The Mission Manifest represents management’s best estimate of the launch services market taking into account all known information. Due to the volatility of the government launch market, it is possible that changes in quantity and timing of launches could occur that would change the Mission Manifest and, therefore, the financial performance of the Delta programs. We have Delta IV inventory of $1.0 billion and fixed assets of $1.0 billion that may be subject to impairment if we are unable to obtain future contracts and appropriate pricing. Based on the mission manifest (estimated quantities and timing of launch missions for existing and anticipated contracts) we believe we will recover these costs. The Delta II and IV programs are reported in the L&OS segment. Satellites As is the standard for the commercial satellite industry, contracts are fixed-price in nature and include on-orbit incentive payments. Many of the existing satellite programs have very complex designs including unique phased array antenna designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we have continued to experience schedule delays and cost impacts. If the issues continue, they could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of the satellites creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed, which could trigger termination for default (TFD) provisions or other financially significant exposure. We have one commercial satellite program that could expose us to a TFD notification risk of $137 million. Management believes a TFD is not likely due to continued performance to contract requirements and continuing contractual efforts in process. Our satellite programs are reported in either the Network Systems or L&OS segments. See discussion of Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. (BSSI)/ICO Global Communications (Operations), Ltd. (ICO) litigation in note 24. On September 10, 2004, a group of insurance underwriters for Thuraya Satellite Telecommunications (Thuraya) requested arbitration before the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), against BSSI. The Request for Arbitration alleges that BSSI breached its contract with Thuraya for sale of a 702 36 Table of Contents Satellite which experienced anomalies with its concentrator solar arrays. The claimants seek approximately $199 million (plus claims of interest, costs and fees) consisting of insurance payments made to Thuraya and further reserved the right to seek an additional $39 million currently in dispute between Thuraya and certain of its insurers. Thuraya has reserved its rights to seek uninsured losses that could increase the total amount disputed to $365 million. We believe that these claims lack merit and intend to vigorously defend against them. In certain launch and satellite sales contracts, we include provisions for replacement launch services or hardware if we do not meet specified performance criteria. We have historically purchased insurance to cover these exposures when allowed under the terms of the contract. The current insurance market reflects unusually high premium rates and also suffers from a lack of capacity to handle all insurance requirements. We make decisions on the procurement of insurance based on our analysis of risk. There is one contractual launch currently scheduled for the second quarter of 2006 for which full insurance coverage has not been procured. We estimate that the potential uninsured amount for that launch could range from $65 million to $315 million, depending on the nature of the uninsured event. Future Combat Systems On April 5, 2005 the U.S. Army announced that it plans to convert the Future Combat Systems (FCS) program from an Other Transaction Agreement (OTA) to a standard DoD contract. An OTA is contracted under a different congressional authority than a standard DoD contract and generally imposes fewer administrative contractual requirements. The current OTA has been modified to incorporate clauses relating to the Truth in Negotiations Act, Cost Accounting Standards, and the Procurement Integrity Act. We signed a Federal Acquisition Regulations-based Undefinitized Contract Authorization with the Army on September 23 and definitization is scheduled for March 2006. Based on our assessment of the possible contractual changes, we do not believe there will be a significant impact to earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. Future Imagery Architecture On September 28, 2005 we received a partial stop-work order from the National Reconnaissance Office for the Future Imagery Architecture (FIA) program, which makes it probable that our scope of work will be reduced. In the third quarter, revised cost and fee estimates were included in our financial statements to reflect our assessment of the probable outcome. If the final cost and fee outcome is materially different than our current assessment, it could impact our financial performance. The revenue loss was immaterial in 2005. This program is included in the Network Systems segment. 767 Tanker Program Prior to the fourth quarter of 2004, we incurred substantial pre-contract costs for development of one in-production aircraft for the 767 Tanker program. These costs were being deferred based on our assessment that it was probable we would recover these costs when we were awarded the USAF 767 Tanker contract. The pre-contract costs were being deferred and recorded in inventory based on AICPA Statement of Position 81-1, Accounting for Performance of Construction-Type and Certain Production-Type Contracts, which states that costs may be deferred if they can be associated with a specific anticipated contract, and if their recoverability from that contract is probable. Our assessment of probability was based on the fact that the DoD Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2005 provided $100 million funding for tanker replacement and the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2005 provided authorization for the procurement of 100 tanker aircraft and associated support contracts. In addition, we believed, based on our understanding of the requirements, that our 767 aircraft was the most cost-effective solution that met those requirements and, therefore, that it was probable we would be awarded the USAF 767 Tanker contract. Based on prior DoD contracting practices, we also believed it was probable that we would be awarded the initial support contracts. On January 14, 2005, as a result of our 2004 year-end review, we updated our assessment of the probability of securing the USAF 767 Tanker contract and announced our plan to recognize pre-tax 37 Table of Contents charges totaling $275 million in our year-end 2004 financial statements based on the continued delay of the contract award and the likely re-competition of the contract. Commercial Airplanes share was $195 million and IDS’ share was $80 million. Within IDS, A&WS and Support Systems were impacted by the charge. The charge included $47 million of incurred design and development cost and $33 million for anticipated supplier penalties. Through 2005, the 767 Tanker program has orders for eight 767 Tankers, four from the Italian Air Force and four from the Japan Self Defense Agency. The first aircraft for Italy will be tendered for acceptance in late 2006 and our first delivery to Japan will occur in early 2007. Work continues on the Company Sponsored Research and Development (CSR&D) effort as we entered the flight test phase of the program in 2005 and expect to complete it in 2006. The USAF is continuing to pursue a replacement for the KC-135 tanker. Funding has been included in the DoD Appropriation Act for both of its fiscal years 2005 and 2006, and has also been included in the fiscal year 2007 DoD budget request. The USAF has announced that the replacement for the KC-135 will be awarded through a competition which will be held in 2006. We remain firmly committed to the USAF Tanker program and are ready to support our customer in whatever decision is made regarding the recapitalization of the nation’s current aerial refueling fleet. Comanche On February 23, 2004 the U.S. Government announced plans to terminate for convenience (TFC) the RAH-66 Comanche Engineering and Manufacturing Development contract. The joint venture between us and Sikorsky Aircraft, a division of United Technologies Corporation, had a 50/50 share in program work and earnings. On March 19, 2004 the U.S. Government issued a partial TFC notification. A termination proposal was submitted to the U.S. Government on February 25, 2005. An updated proposal was submitted in January 2006 to reflect actual costs through 2005. We expect that a settlement will be reached by the end of the first quarter of 2006. The program represented less than 1% of our 2005 revenues. No material impact on our financial statements is expected. Integrated Defense Systems (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 30,791 $ 30,465 $ 27,361 % of Total Company Revenues 56 % 58 % 54 % Operating Earnings $ 3,890 $ 2,925 $ 766 Operating Margins 12.6 % 9.6 % 2.8 % Research and Development $ 855 $ 834 $ 846 Contractual Backlog $ 36,341 $ 39,151 $ 40,883 Unobligated Backlog $ 43,759 $ 47,270 $ 50,564 Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term awards. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of orders and backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context IDS revenues remained stable in 2005 due to moderating defense budgets, up 1% from 2004, after strong growth of 11% in 2004 over 2003. The operating earnings increase of $965 million from 2004 to 38 Table of Contents 2005 was primarily due to higher L&OS earnings largely driven by the net gain of $578 million ($9 million of which was recognized at the Other segment) from the Rocketdyne divestiture in 2005. Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents funded work to perform, and unobligated backlog, which represents unfunded work to perform. IDS total backlog decreased 7% in 2005, from $86.4 billion to $80.1 billion, yet still remains industry-leading. Given our annual revenue of almost $31 billion, we have 2.6 years worth of sales in backlog, an important indicator of future workload. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Aircraft and Weapons Systems (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 11,444 $ 11,394 $ 10,763 % of Total Company Revenues 21 % 22 % 21 % Operating Earnings $ 1,707 $ 1,636 $ 1,420 Operating Margins 14.9 % 14.4 % 13.2 % Research and Development $ 374 $ 382 $ 360 Contractual Backlog $ 19,161 $ 18,256 $ 19,352 Unobligated Backlog $ 12,006 $ 17,197 $ 24,176 Revenues A&WS revenues remained stable between 2004 and 2005 primarily due to increased deliveries on F-15 and Apache and higher volume on C-40 and F-22. This was offset by decreased deliveries on F/A-18 and lower volume on Chinook, V-22, and the Comanche termination. Revenues grew 6% from 2003 to 2004 due to increased deliveries on F/A-18 and Apache and higher volume on F-22 and Chinook. This was partially offset by fewer deliveries on T-45 and lower volume as a result of the Comanche termination in 2004. Deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications were as follows: Aircraft and Weapon Systems 2005 2004 2003 C-17 Globemaster 16 16 16 F/A-18E/F Super Hornet 42 48 44 T-45TS Goshawk 10 7 12 F-15E Eagle 6 3 4 C-40A Clipper 2 3 1 AH-64 Apache 12 3 – Operating Earnings A&WS operating earnings increased 4% between 2004 and 2005 even though revenues were stable. In addition to continued strong performance, the 767 Tanker program CSR&D effort in 2005 was reduced as compared to 2004 and operating earnings in 2004 were negatively impacted by the charges discussed above related to the USAF Tanker program. 39 Table of Contents Operating earnings grew 15% from 2003 to 2004 partly due to the revenue growth mentioned above and partly due to significant performance improvements from contract close-out activity and lean initiatives in 2004, partially offset by the 2004 767 Tanker charges. Research and Development The A&WS segment continues to focus its research and development where it can use its customer knowledge, technical strength and large-scale integration capabilities to provide transformational solutions to meet the war fighter’s enduring needs. Spending has remained consistent over the past three years. Research and development activities leverage our capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies across a broad spectrum of capabilities designed to enhance situational awareness and survivability, increase mission effectiveness and interoperability, and improve affordability, reliability and economic ownership. Continued research and development investments in unmanned systems have enabled the demonstration of multi-vehicle coordinated flight and distributed control of high-performance unmanned combat air vehicles. Research and development in advanced weapons technologies emphasizes, among other things, precision guidance and multi-mode targeting. Research and development investments in the Global Tanker Transport Aircraft program represent a significant opportunity to provide state-of-the-art refueling capabilities to domestic and international customers. Other research and development efforts include upgrade and technology insertions to network-enable and enhance the capability and competitiveness of current product lines such as the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15E Eagle, AH-64 Apache, CH-47 Chinook and C-17 Globemaster III. Backlog A&WS total backlog decreased 12% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to sales on C-17 and F/A-18 from multi-year contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by additional F-15 and Chinook orders. Total backlog decreased 19% from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to sales on C-17 and F/A-18 from multi-year contracts awarded in prior years.

Revenues grew 22% from 2003 to 2004 due to strong growth in FCS, GMD, Proprietary, and Airborne Command and Control programs, partially offset by lower volume in Homeland Security. Operating Earnings Network Systems operating earnings decreased 34% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to revised cost and fee estimates in 2005 resulting from technical and quality issues on Proprietary, GMD, 737 AEW&C, and a military satellite program. 40 Table of Contents Earnings increased 50% from 2003 to 2004 partly due to the revenue growth mentioned above; improved performance in Homeland Security and Proprietary partially offset by revised cost and fee estimates on a military satellite program and GMD in 2004; and due to a $55 million pre-tax charge taken in 2003 on the Resource 21 joint venture when NASA did not award us an imagery contract. Research and Development The Network Systems research and development funding remains focused on the development of Communications and Command & Control capabilities that support a network-centric architecture approach for our various government customers. We are investing in the communications market to enable connectivity between existing air/ground platforms, increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and leverage innovative communications concepts. Key programs in this area include Joint Tactical Radio System, Global Positioning System, and Transformational Communications System. Investments were also made to support various Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance business opportunities including MMA, AEW&C aircraft, and concepts that will lead to the development of next-generation space intelligence systems. A major contributor to our support of these DoD transformation programs is the investment in the Boeing Integration Center (BIC) and extended network of modeling, simulation and analysis capabilities where our Network-Centric Operations concepts are developed in partnership with our customers. Significant upgrades were made in 2005 to the Virtual Warfare Center in St Louis and several other smaller facilities. Along with increased funding to support these areas of architecture and network-centric capabilities development, we also maintained our investment levels in Global Missile Defense and advanced missile defense concepts and technologies. Backlog Network Systems total backlog decreased 5% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to sales in 2005 from large multi-year orders received in prior years on FCS, GMD, and MMA, partially offset by orders for Proprietary programs. Total backlog increased 5% from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to additional orders for FCS and the initial MMA award in 2004.

Revenues grew 11% from 2003 to 2004 due to increased volume in Supply Chain Services programs such as Apache spares, Integrated Support programs like C-17, and Training & Support Systems programs such as Fixed Wing and Rotorcraft. Operating Earnings Support Systems operating earnings grew 16% from 2004 to 2005 partly reflecting the revenue increase mentioned above, partly due to continued performance improvements 41 Table of Contents in 2005 in Training & Support Systems, MM&U, and Supply Chain Services programs and partly due to a 767 Tanker $18 million pre-tax write-off of pre-contract costs in 2004 due to a slip in the award of the USAF contract. Earnings grew 45% from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the significant performance improvements from contract close-out activities and lean initiatives in 2004 as well as the increased revenue mentioned above, partially offset by the 2004 pre-tax charge on the 767 Tanker program mentioned above. Research and Development Support Systems continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including Engineering and Logistic Services, MM&U, Supply Chain Services, Training and Support Systems, and Advanced Logistics Services, as well as on moving into the innovative Network Centric Logistics (NCL) areas. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative and disciplined tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Examples of successful programs stemming from these investment strategies include the C-17 Globemaster Sustainment partnership, the F/A-18 Integrated Readiness Support Teaming (FIRST) program, and the F-15 Singapore Performance Based Logistics contract. Backlog Support Systems total backlog increased 18% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to orders in Supply Chain Services and Engineering and Logistics Services, partially offset by sales throughout the segment. Total backlog increased 13% from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to orders in Life Cycle Customer Support programs, partially offset by sales throughout the segment.

This was partially offset by higher contract values for Delta IV launch contracts in 2005. Revenues remained stable from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to the favorable TFC settlement in 2004 mentioned above offset by lower satellite and launch deliveries and milestone completions in 2004 compared to 2003. Deliveries of production units were as follows: 2005 2004 2003 Delta II 2 4 4 Delta IV 2 Commercial/Civil Satellites 3 2 3 42 Table of Contents Operating Earnings The L&OS operating earnings improvement from 2004 to 2005 was driven by the net gains on the sale of Rocketdyne $578 million, ($9 million of which was recognized at the Other segment) and EDD ($25 million), gain from the sale of a parcel of land at our Seal Beach, California facility, and higher contract values for Delta IV launch contracts in 2005. The operating losses recorded in 2004 were caused by performance issues in the satellite business due to cost growth from technical and quality issues and write-offs of slow moving satellite inventory and also by cost growth on our Delta IV program, partially offset by the favorable TFC settlement mentioned above. The earnings improvement from 2003 to 2004 was primarily driven by two significant events in 2003. First, a goodwill impairment charge of $572 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2003 as a result of an internal reorganization whereby the SFAS No. 142 reportable segments, operating segments, and reporting unit designations changed, causing significantly different relationships between reporting unit carrying values and fair values. Specifically, the new L&OS reporting unit was created by combining six pre-existing reporting units. The carrying value of one of these reporting units, Boeing Satellite Systems, exceeded its fair value resulting in the goodwill balances at this reporting unit being fully impaired during 2002. However, the carrying values of the other five reporting units were less than their fair values, so the goodwill balances at these reporting units were not impaired during 2002. In addition, the Board of Directors in early 2003 approved our long range business plan which included downward revisions to cash flow projections for the L&OS reporting unit. The combination of these factors resulted in the newly created L&OS reporting unit having a carrying value that exceeded its fair value, prompting recognition of the goodwill impairment charge. In addition, 2003 earnings were further impacted by a second quarter charge of $1,030 million, of which $835 million was attributable to the Delta IV program caused by a combination of factors. The most significant driver was the requirement to spread fixed costs of the Delta IV program over a reduced number of anticipated launches as a result of continued weakness in the commercial space launch market, resulting in an earnings impact of $412 million. Secondly, the program experienced cost growth of $360 million primarily related to payload integration and launch support costs. In each of these cases, the additional costs were not billable under the respective contracts. In addition, the remaining $63 million of the charge resulted from our determination that it was no longer probable that our U.S. Government customer would agree to price increases for change orders in connection with existing contracted and awarded Delta IV launches. The remaining $195 million of the 2003 charge related to Boeing Satellite Systems incurring additional costs as a result of satellite program complexities. These complexities caused technical and quality issues resulting in schedule delays, cost impacts, and late delivery penalties which were not billable under the respective contract. The 2003 results also include the adjustments made to equity investments in Ellipso, SkyBridge and Teledesic resulting in a net write-down of $27 million. Divestitures On February 28, 2005, we completed the stock sale of EDD to L-3 Communications. On August 2, 2005, we completed the sale of the Rocketdyne business to United Technologies Corporation (UTC). See Note 8. Investments We are a 50/50 partner with Lockheed in a joint venture called United Space Alliance, which is responsible for all ground processing of the Space Shuttle fleet and for space-related operations with the USAF. United Space Alliance also performs modifications, testing and checkout operations that are required to ready the Space Shuttle for launch. United Space Alliance operations are performed under cost-plus type contracts. Our proportionate share of joint venture earnings is recognized as income from operating investments in the consolidated statements of operations. The operating earnings resulting from this venture for 2005, 2004, and 2003 were $72 million, $70 million, and $52 million, respectively. We have also entered into an agreement with Lockheed to create a 50/50 joint venture named United Launch Alliance (ULA). ULA will combine the production, engineering, test and launch operations 43 Table of Contents associated with U.S. government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Martin Atlas rockets. It is expected that ULA will reduce the cost of meeting the critical national security and NASA expendable launch vehicle needs of the United States. The closing of the ULA transaction is subject to certain closing conditions including government and regulatory approval in the United States and internationally. On August 9, 2005, Boeing and Lockheed received clearance regarding the formation of ULA from the European Commission. On October 24, 2005, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requested additional information from us and Lockheed related to ULA in response to the pre-merger notice under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 (HSR) submitted by the parties. The FTC’s “second request” extends the period that the FTC is permitted to review the transaction under the HSR Act. Upon completion of the transaction, ULA would be reported as an equity method investment. We do not expect this agreement to have a material impact to our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position for 2006. If the conditions to closing are not satisfied and the ULA transaction is not consummated by March 31, 2006, either we or Lockheed Martin may terminate the joint venture agreement. Research and Development The L&OS research and development investment is currently focused on the development of key technologies and systems solutions to support our NASA customer in the development of new space exploration systems. We also continue to make prudent investments of research and development resources in the satellite manufacturing business to enhance existing designs to meet evolving customer requirements. Finally, continued research and development investment was used to complete anomaly resolution on the Delta IV vehicle. Backlog L&OS total backlog decreased 27% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to reduced orders for satellites and Space Shuttle Return to Flight activity. Total backlog increased 8% from 2003 to 2004 primarily due to large orders for DIRECTV commercial satellites and additional NASA activity, partially offset by sales throughout the segment. Boeing Capital Corporation Business Environment and Trends In the commercial aircraft market, BCC provides selective financing solutions to our Commercial Airplanes segment customers. In the space and defense markets, BCC primarily structures financing solutions for our IDS segment customers. BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2005 totaled $9.2 billion, which was substantially all our commercial aircraft. While worldwide traffic levels are well above traffic levels carried by the airlines in the recent past, the effects of higher fuel prices on the airline industry continue to impact commercial aircraft values. Recently published sources and market transactions indicate that passenger load factors are at record high levels, the supply of economically viable used aircraft is limited and, lease rates for aircraft are increasing. However, despite these positive environmental factors, values for the various aircraft types serving as collateral in BCC’s portfolio generally have not increased. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. At the same time, the credit ratings of many airlines, particularly in the United States, have remained at low levels. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 1,900 commercial jet aircraft (10.2% of current world fleet) continue to be parked, including both in production and out-of-production aircraft types of which over 50% are not expected to return to service. At December 31, 2005, $2.6 billion of BCC’s portfolio was collateralized by 717 aircraft. During 2005, BCC and the Other segment provided $25 million and $76 million in valuation reserves due to a decrease in the collateral value of the 717 aircraft. Should the 717 aircraft suffer an additional decline in value, such impacts could result in a potential material adverse effect on the Other Segment’s earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. 44 Table of Contents In October 2003, Commercial Airplanes announced the decision to end production of the 757 aircraft, and the final 757 aircraft was produced in October 2004. At December 31, 2005, $1.2 billion of BCC’s portfolio was collateralized by the 757 aircraft. During the year ended December 31, 2005, the Other segment provided $22 million in our valuation reserve due to a decrease in the collateral value of the 757 aircraft. Should the 757 aircraft suffer a decline in value and market acceptance, such impacts could result in a potential material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position. Significant Customer Contingencies A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is concentrated among U.S. commercial airline customers. Certain customers have filed for bankruptcy protection or requested lease or loan restructurings; these negotiations were in various stages as of December 31, 2005. BCC does not expect that the current bankruptcies or reorganizations of ATA Holdings Corp (ATA), Viacao Aerea Rio-Grandense (VARIG), Delta or Northwest including a return of some or all of the aircraft financed will have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. United Airlines, Inc. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, United Airlines, Inc. (United) accounted for $1.1 billion (11.7%) of BCC’s total portfolio. At December 31, 2005, United was BCC’s second largest customer based on portfolio carrying value. At December 31, 2005, the United portfolio was secured by security interests in two 767 aircraft and 13 777 aircraft and by an ownership and security interest in five 757 aircraft. At December 31, 2005, United was current on all of its obligations related to these 20 aircraft. On February 1, 2006, United emerged from bankruptcy and has assumed all our financing which were restructured in September 2003 as part of the bankruptcy proceeding. ATA Holdings Corp. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, ATA accounted for $253 million and $705 million (2.7% and 7.3%) of BCC’s total portfolio. At December 31, 2005, the ATA portfolio consisted of six operating leases for 757 aircraft and a note receivable. On October 26, 2004, ATA filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As a result, on December 29, 2004, BCC entered into an agreement in principle with ATA whereby ATA agreed to continue to lease 12 757 aircraft under restructured terms and agreed to return eight of the 12 757 aircraft during the second half of 2005 and early 2006. ATA is obligated to pay rent on all aircraft until returned. BCC concurrently entered into an agreement with Continental Airlines (Continental) to lease each of these eight 757 aircraft as they are returned by ATA. In February 2005, following completion of certain conditions, BCC reclassified the 12 757 aircraft from finance leases to operating leases. On July 14, 2005, the bankruptcy court approved the assumption of 11 of the restructured 757 aircraft leases by mutual agreement between BCC and ATA, one 757 aircraft lease was rejected and the aircraft returned to accommodate BCC’s timely re-leasing of the aircraft to Continental. The bankruptcy court order also approved a settlement agreement setting forth BCC’s deficiency claim for the four 757 aircraft to be retained by ATA and a process for determining the amount of our deficiency claims for the remaining eight 757 aircraft that will be returned to BCC. During 2005, six of the eight aircraft were returned and subsequently delivered to Continental. The remaining two aircraft were returned to BCC and delivered to Continental in January 2006. Viacao Aerea Rio-Grandense. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, VARIG accounted for $270 million and $400 million (2.9% and 4.1%) of BCC’s total portfolio. At December 31, 2005 the VARIG portfolio consisted of two 737 aircraft and six MD-11 aircraft. We exercised early lease termination rights and took possession of two MD-11 aircraft in the second quarter of 2005 with a carrying value of $73 million. The aircraft were subsequently sold to another customer. On June 17, 2005, VARIG filed a request for reorganization which was granted on June 22, 2005 by Brazilian Reorganization Courts. In 45 Table of Contents October 2005, VARIG returned one MD-11 aircraft which was immediately re-leased to another customer. In December 2005, VARIG’s reorganization plan was approved both by the creditors and the Brazilian Reorganization Court. In recent years, VARIG has repeatedly defaulted on its obligations under leases with BCC, which has resulted in deferrals and restructurings, some of which are ongoing. Delta Air Lines, Inc. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Delta accounted for $118 million and $146 million (1.3% and 1.5%) of BCC’s total portfolio. At December 31, 2005, the Delta portfolio consisted of two EETCs secured by 17 767 aircraft, 18 737 aircraft and 13 757 aircraft. On September 14, 2005, Delta filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Delta retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including the right to reject the restructuring terms with its creditors and return aircraft, including BCC aircraft. To date, none of the aircraft securing BCC’s investments have been rejected or returned. Although Delta has affirmed its obligations for the two EETCs in the bankruptcy court, Delta still reserves the right to reject or return the aircraft. Northwest Airlines, Inc. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, Northwest accounted for $494 million and $295 million (5.4% and 3.0%) of BCC’s total portfolio. At December 31, 2005, the Northwest portfolio consisted of notes receivable on three 747 aircraft, three 757 aircraft, and three additional notes receivable, as well as an EETC secured by 11 A319 aircraft, three A330 aircraft and six 757 aircraft and an ETC secured by one 747 aircraft. On September 14, 2005, Northwest filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Northwest retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including the right to reject the restructuring terms with its creditors and return aircraft, including BCC aircraft. Northwest has filed a motion to reject leases or return certain aircraft. Although Northwest has identified one 747 aircraft financed by an ETC in which BCC owns an interest as being subject to potential rejection, this aircraft has not yet been rejected or returned. In October 2005, Northwest requested a restructuring of certain obligations and BCC is currently negotiating restructuring terms. As a result of the current financial difficulties of Northwest, BCC has deemed the EETC and ETC to be other than temporarily impaired. During the third quarter of 2005, we reduced the carrying values of these investments to their estimated fair values of $26 million and recorded an asset impairment charge of $24 million. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) 2005 2004 2003 Revenues $ 966 $ 959 $ 991 % of Total Company Revenues 2 % 2 % 2 % Operating Earnings $ 232 $ 183 $ 91 Operating Margins 24 % 19 % 9 % Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of interest from financing receivables and notes, lease income from equipment under operating lease, investment income, and gains on disposals of investments. BCC’s revenues were essentially unchanged in 2005. The decrease in revenue in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily attributable to lower new business volume. Operating Earnings BCC’s operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. The increase in 2005 operating earnings was primarily due to a lower asset impairment expense and the absence of debt redemption costs partially offset by increased depreciation expense. 46 Table of Contents As summarized in the following table, during the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized pre-tax expenses of $132 million, of which $34 million related to BCC, in response to the deterioration in the credit worthiness of BCC’s airline customers, airline bankruptcy filings and the continued decline in the commercial aircraft and general equipment asset values. For the same period in 2004, we recognized pre-tax expenses of $165 million in response to the deterioration, of which $68 million related to BCC.

During 2005, BCC recorded a net recovery through the provision for losses of $25 million. This amount consisted of a net benefit of $26 million as a result of Hawaiian Airlines, Inc.’s (Hawaiian) emergence from bankruptcy (including a partial offset by a decline in the collateral value of the 717 aircraft leased to Hawaiian), a benefit of $16 million as a result of the repayment of certain notes and a net provision of $17 million. During 2004, BCC also recorded a net recovery through the provision for losses of $38 million. This amount consisted of the mitigation of collateral exposure with certain customers and a net benefit due to refinements in the methodology for measuring collateral values, offset by certain impaired receivables. During the year ended December 31, 2005, BCC recorded customer financing-related asset impairment charges of $13 million due to the reduction of estimated future cash flows. In addition, BCC recorded an impairment charge of $20 million related to a Commercial Financial Services (CFS) asset, which was not subject to the purchase and sale agreement with General Electric Capital Corporation (GECC). During the year ended December 31, 2005, BCC reduced the carrying value of certain of its EETCs and an ETC due to an other-than temporary impairment of $53 million, partially offset by the fair value of other collateral available to BCC in the amount of $27 million. During the year ended December 31, 2004, BCC recognized customer financing-related charges totaling $27 million as a result of declines in market values and projected future rents for aircraft and equipment. During the year ended December 31, 2004, BCC also recognized a charge of $79 million which consisted of $47 million related to an other-than-temporary impairment of a held-to-maturity investment in ATA maturing in 2015, and $32 million related to the impairment of a D tranche EETC which finances aircraft with Delta. BCC carefully monitors the relative value of aircraft equipment since we remain at substantial economic risk to significant decreases in the value of aircraft equipment and their associated lease rates. At December 31, 2005 2004 BCC Customer Financing and Investment Portfolio $ 9,206 $ 9,680 % of Total Receivables in Valuation Allowance 2.0 % 4.2 % Debt $ 6,322 $ 7,024 Debt-to-Equity Ratio 5.0-to-1 5.0-to-1 47 Table of Contents BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2005 decreased from December 31, 2004 due to normal portfolio run-off, the impact of restructuring certain finance leases to operating leases resulting in a $200 million charge-off to the allowance, the sale of certain portfolio assets, and prepayments. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, BCC had $47 million and $37 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, which, as of December 31, 2005, included $36 million of assets currently under lease. Of the remaining $11 million and $37 million of assets held for sale or re-lease at December 31, 2005 and 2004, $6 million and $25 million had firm contracts to be placed on lease. Additionally, leases with a carrying value of approximately $363 million are scheduled to terminate in the next 12 months. The related aircraft are being remarketed, of which $238 million were identified with firm contracts in place at December 31, 2005, to be sold or placed on lease. Other Segment Other segment operating losses were $334 million during 2005 as compared to losses of $535 million during 2004. Major factors contributing to results for the other segment are described below. During 2003 and 2004, we delivered a total of five 767 aircraft to a joint venture named TRM Aircraft Leasing Co. Ltd. (TRM). Such arrangement was accounted for as an operating lease due to additional financing and expense sharing arrangements with TRM. As a result, as of December 31, 2004, we deferred lease income of $379 million. During April 2005, we terminated our ongoing obligations to TRM and also received full payment from TRM for the financing arrangement and recognized the remaining deferred lease income of $369 million and repayment for the financing arrangement of $42 million as revenue and charged the remaining net asset value to Cost of services. This transaction resulted in earnings before income taxes of $63 million in our Consolidated Statements of Operations in 2005. (See Note 15) In 2005, we recorded provisions for customer financing losses of $98 million, which consisted of losses of $76 million and $22 million, due to the decrease in the collateral values of the 717 and 757, respectively. In 2004, such provisions were $82 million due to deteriorated airline credit ratings and depressed aircraft values. Additionally, charges of $13 million were recognized in 2004 related to the decline in lease rates on certain aircraft. In 2005, we sold real property and equipment which resulted in a pretax gain of $29 million reported in the other segment. During 2004, we recorded depreciation of $61 million related to a demolished building and incurred an additional $18 million pretax loss related to accounting for various real property transactions. In 2005, our research and development costs recorded at Boeing Technology decreased by approximately $32 million primarily due to cost reduction strategies implemented across the business units during the year. Critical Accounting Policies and Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented Contract Accounting Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding 48 Table of Contents contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. Government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contract’s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. During all of 2005, IDS’s gross margin performance fell within the historical range of plus or minus 1.0% change to gross margin. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in IDS for all of 2005 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1.0%, it would have increased or decreased income for the year by approximately $308 million. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured parts, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs. Underlying all estimates used for program accounting is the forecasted market and corresponding production rates. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are recognized on a prospective basis. 49 Table of Contents Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. Our recent experience has been that estimated changes due to accounting quantity, model mix, escalation, and cost performance adjustments have resulted in changes over the course of a year to the combined cost of sales percentages of all commercial airplane programs within a range of plus or minus 1%. If combined cost of sales percentages for all commercial airplane programs for all of 2005 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased income for 2005 by approximately $190 million. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft specific data such as, model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. This process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. There are several possible markets to which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. These markets include, but are not limited to, (1) the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage, (2) the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customer’s requirements, or (3) the scrap market. Collateral valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. This quarterly collateral valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft. Based on the best market information available at the time, it is probable that we would be obligated to perform on trade-in commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $72 million and $116 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004. Accounts payable and other liabilities included $22 million and $25 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, which represents the exposure related to these trade-in commitments. Had the estimate of trade-in value used to calculate our obligation related to probable trade-in commitments been 10% higher or lower than our actual assessment, using a measurement date of December 31, 2005, Accounts payable and other liabilities would have decreased or increased by approximately $5 million. We continually update our assessment of the likelihood of our trade-in aircraft purchase commitments and continue to monitor all these commitments for adverse developments. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease When events or circumstances indicate (and no less than annually), we review the carrying value of all aircraft and equipment under operating lease and held for sale or re-lease for potential impairment. We evaluate assets under operating lease or held for re-lease for impairment when the expected undiscounted cash flow over the remaining useful life is less than the carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow. A key assumption is the expected future lease rates. We also include assumptions about lease terms, end of economic life value of the aircraft or equipment, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset and estimated proceeds from future asset sales. We state assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. 50 Table of Contents When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of asset impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Had future lease rates on these assets been 10% lower, we estimate that the asset impairment expense would have increased by approximately $46 million during 2005. We are unable to predict the magnitude or likelihood of any future impairments. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in ‘Customer financing’, however, the valuation continues to be based on the lower of cost or market. The lower of cost or market assessment is performed quarterly using the process described in the Used aircraft under trade-in commitments section. Allowance for losses on receivables The allowance for losses on receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, results of individual credit reviews and the general state of the economy and airline industry. Factors considered in assessing collectibility include, but are not limited to, a customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase/decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. We review the adequacy of the allowance by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate (i.e. the credit-adjusted collateral exposure). We determine the collateral value by calculating the median values obtained from third-party equipment appraisers’ industry data. The applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted-average remaining contract term. Credit ratings are determined for each customer in the portfolio. Those ratings are updated based on public information and information obtained directly from our customers. In recognition of the uncertainty of the ultimate loss experience and relatively long duration of the portfolio, a range of reasonably possible outcomes of the portfolio’s credit-adjusted collateral exposure is calculated by varying the applicable default rate by approximately plus or minus 15%. The resulting range of the allowance necessary to cover credit-adjusted collateral exposure as of December 31, 2005, was approximately $240 million to $307 million. Lease Residual Values Equipment under operating leases is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the lease term or projected economic life of the asset. At December 31, 2005, the projected residual value of total equipment under operating leases was $2.6 billion. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases. For example, a change in the estimated residual values of 1% could result in a cumulative pre-tax earnings impact of $26 million as of December 31, 2005, to be recognized over the remaining term of the lease portfolio. 51 Table of Contents Goodwill impairment Due to various acquisitions, goodwill has historically constituted a significant portion of our long-term assets. We perform our goodwill impairment test annually, on April 1, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions, and are subject to review and approval by our senior management and Board of Directors. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded. At the date of our previous impairment test, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of our common stock would have had no impact on the financial statements. Postretirement plans The liabilities and net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). We use a discount rate that is based on a point-in-time estimate as of our September 30 annual measurement date. This rate is determined based on a review of long-term, high quality corporate bonds as of the measurement date and use of models that match projected benefit payments of our major U.S. pension and other postretirement plans to coupons and maturities from high quality bonds. (See Note 17) In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate. As of September 30, 2005 (in millions) Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bps Pension plans Dollars Dollars Projected benefit obligation (pensions) (1,370 ) 1,570 Net periodic pension cost (160 ) 150 Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (180 ) 200 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost (15 ) 15 Net periodic pension costs include an underlying expected long-term rate of return on pension fund assets. This expected return on assets assumption is derived from an extensive study conducted by our Trust Investments group and its actuaries on a periodic basis. The study includes a review of 52 Table of Contents actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes with consideration given to the related investment strategy. While the study gives appropriate consideration to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term prospective return. The expected return on plan assets determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the net periodic benefit (income)/cost for the upcoming plan year. Pension income or expense is sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2005 pension income by approximately $103 million. Net periodic pension cost also includes an amortization of unrecognized gains and losses and changes in liabilities due to plan amendments. The amount of unrecognized gains and losses can be significant and can significantly increase (or decrease) future net periodic pension cost. The funded status of pension plans is sensitive to the discount rate and actual returns on assets. Changes in the funded status may have significant immediate impacts on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as of a new measurement date. At present, our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position includes a prepaid pension asset, which primarily represents losses that have not yet been recognized. In the normal course of events, the loss will be recognized over a period of years and the prepaid pension asset will be correspondingly reduced. However, under certain economic conditions, we could be required to recognize all or a substantial portion of the recognized loss in a single accounting period. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87 requires recognition of a minimum liability equal to the excess (if any) of a pension plan’s accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) over its assets. The ABO is the actuarial present value of the plan’s obligation for benefits earned to date but without credit for expected future salary increases. When a plan has an unfunded ABO, or required minimum liability, it is also required to recognize any prepaid pension asset (if any) in excess of unrecognized prior service cost. Because the company’s prepaid pension asset is significant, it is possible that under certain circumstances such as poor actual return on pension assets or low discount rate, several or all of our pension plans could become underfunded and we would have to recognize an additional liability equal to the amount underfunded plus the prepaid pension asset. Such a recognition could result in a significant reduction of our equity in the form of a reduction in Other comprehensive income. Although GAAP expense and pension contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash that we would contribute to the pension plans. Potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under federal law (ERISA) and discretionary contributions made to improve the plans’ funded status. Net periodic costs for other postretirement plans include an assumption of the medical cost trend. To determine the medical trend we look at a combination of information including our future expected medical costs, recent medical costs over the past five years, and general expectations in the industry. The assumed medical cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care plans. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change in the discount rate. As of September 30, 2005 (in millions) Change in medical trend rateIncrease 100 bps Change in medical trend rateDecrease 100 bps Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 712 (624 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost 62 (53 ) 53 Table of Contents Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented In September 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue No. 04-13, Accounting for Purchases and Sales of Inventory with the Same Counterparty (EITF 04-13). EITF 04-13 defines when a purchase and a sale of inventory with the same party that operates in the same line of business should be considered a single nonmonetary transaction subject to Accounting Principles Board Opinion 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions. The Task Force agreed this Issue should be applied to new arrangements entered into in reporting periods beginning after March 15, 2006, and to all inventory transactions that are completed after December 15, 2006, for arrangements entered into prior to March 15, 2006. We are currently evaluating the impact of EITF 04-13 on our financial statements. In June 2005, the FASB ratified the consensus reached by the EITF on Issue No. 04-5, Determining Whether a General Partner, or the General Partners as a Group, Controls a Limited Partnership or Similar Entity When the Limited Partners Have Certain Rights (EITF 04-5). EITF 04-5 provides guidance as to when a general partner, or the general partners as a group, control a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights. EITF 04-5 is effective as of June 29, 2005 for general partners of all new limited partnerships formed and for existing limited partnerships for which the partnership agreements are modified. EITF 04-5 is effective as of January 1, 2006 for all other limited partnerships. Our adoption of the provisions of EITF 04-5 will not have a material impact on our financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 151, Inventory Costs – an amendment of ARB No. 43. This Standard requires that certain abnormal costs be recognized as current period charges rather than as a portion of the inventory cost, and that fixed production overhead costs be allocated to inventory based on the normal capacity of the production facility. The provisions of this Standard apply prospectively and are effective for inventory costs incurred after January 1, 2006. While we believe this Standard will not have a material effect on our financial statements, the impact of adopting these new rules is dependent on events that could occur in future periods, and cannot be determined until the event occurs in future periods. Contingent Items Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts and other matters are pending against us. Most significant legal proceedings are related to matters covered by our insurance. Major contingencies are discussed below. Government investigations We are subject to various U.S. Government investigations, including those related to procurement activities and the alleged possession and misuse of third-party proprietary data, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted. Such proceedings involve, or could involve claims by the Government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. Under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. We believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of these disputes and investigations will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, except as set forth in Note 24 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Other contingencies We are also a defendant in suits filed by Lockheed, ICO Global Communications, Ltd. and several of our employees. See Note 24. 54 Table of Contents We are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites discussed. Such requirements have resulted in our being involved in legal proceedings, claims and remediation obligations since the 1980s. We routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties who have and have not agreed to a settlement and of recoveries from insurance carriers. Our policy is to immediately accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites based on our best estimate within a range of potential exposure for investigation, cleanup and monitoring costs to be incurred. The costs incurred and expected to be incurred in connection with such activities have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on us. With respect to results of operations, related charges have averaged less than 1% of historical annual revenues. Although not considered likely, should we be required to incur remediation charges at the high level of the range of potential exposure, the additional charges would be less than 3% of historical annual revenues. Because of the regulatory complexities and risk of unidentified contaminated sites and circumstances, the potential exists for environmental remediation costs to be materially different from the estimated costs accrued for identified contaminated sites. However, based on all known facts and expert analyses, we believe it is not reasonably likely that identified environmental contingencies will result in additional costs that would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or to our operating results and cash flow trends. We have entered into standby letters of credit agreements and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $4.0 billion as of December 31, 2005 and approximately $3.2 billion at December 31, 2004. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally investments, fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to interest rate changes. Additionally, Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC) uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Based on the current holdings of investments, as well as related swaps, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material for these instruments. The investors in the fixed-rate debt obligations that we issue, do not have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. The principal source of BCC’s market risk relates to interest rate changes. This risk is managed by matching the profile of BCC’s liabilities with the profile of assets. In a state of perfect matching, assets would be funded by debt of an equivalent term and other attributes. Perfect matching is impractical and inefficient given the irregular and unexpected amortization of some assets compared to how capital markets function as a source of funding. The ensuing exposure to mismatch risk is measured and managed with the use of interest rate derivatives. We do not use interest rate derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. 55 Table of Contents Every quarter BCC uses duration-based measures and analysis to estimate the impact of changes in interest rates. Potential changes in the net fair value of assets, liabilities and derivatives are calculated based on the amount and timing of projected cash flows. It is important to note that these measures and sensitivity analysis are estimates and tools that depend on the assumptions and parameters used in the related models. These models must be complemented by the experience and judgment of management. Although the assets, liabilities and derivatives affected by a change in interest rates are not traded, based on an immediate, one-time, 100 basis-point increase in market rates at December 31, 2005, BCC estimated that the tax-adjusted net fair value of these items would have decreased by $15 million compared to a decrease of $7 million at December 31, 2004. Foreign currency exchange rate risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business and operational financing activities. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2005, a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have reduced our unrealized gains by $28.0 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. Commodity price risk We are subject to commodity price risk relating principally to energy used in production. We periodically use commodity derivatives, such as fixed-price purchase commitments, to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes of commodities. Commodity price exposure related to unhedged contracts is not material. 56 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:34.576802
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacturing, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and the second-largest defense contractor in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors located around the world. Our business strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes and Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses generate substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services that open new frontiers in aerospace. We focus on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. IDS is a defense systems business that integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses with a simultaneously intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as commercial and defense markets often offset each others’ cyclicality. BCC delivers value through supporting our business units and managing overall financial exposures. In 2006, our revenues grew by 15 percent. Earnings from operations increased 7%. We continued to invest in key growth programs as Research and Development expense grew by 48% to $3.3 billion, reflecting increased spending on the 787 and 747-8 programs and lower cost sharing payments from suppliers. We generated operating cash flow of $7.5 billion driven by operating and working capital performance. We reduced debt by $1.2 billion and repurchased 25 million common shares. Our contractual backlog grew 35% to $217 billion, driven by 40% growth at Commercial Airplanes while our total backlog grew 22% to $250 billion. At the end of 2006, we implemented new accounting rules for pensions and other post-retirement benefits, which together with the annual remeasurement of our pension plans reduced our shareholders’ equity by $6.5 billion. This decrease did not affect cash flows or the funded status of our benefit plans. We expect continued growth in Commercial Airplane revenues and deliveries as we execute our record backlog and respond to global demand by ramping up commercial aircraft production. We expect IDS revenue to be slightly lower in 2007 and anticipate that the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) budget growth will moderate over the next several years. We are focused on improving financial performance through a combination of productivity and customer-focused growth. Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Commercial Airplanes $ 28,465 $ 21,365 $ 19,925 Integrated Defense Systems 32,439 31,106 30,739 Boeing Capital Corporation 1,025 966 959 Other 299 657 275 Accounting differences/eliminations (698 ) (473 ) (498 ) Total revenues $ 61,530 $ 53,621 $ 51,400 18 Table of Contents Higher consolidated revenues in 2006 were primarily due to higher new commercial aircraft deliveries. IDS revenues were up moderately in 2006 as growth in Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems and Support Systems was partially offset by lower volume in Network and Space Systems. BCC revenues increased in 2006 primarily due to higher investment income and higher net gain on disposal of assets. Other segment revenues decreased in 2006 as a result of the buyout of several operating lease aircraft in the amount of $369 million in 2005. In addition, revenues decreased in Accounting differences/eliminations due to higher Commercial Airplanes intercompany deliveries in 2006. Consolidated revenues also increased in 2005 as compared to 2004. The increase was due to the growth at Commercial Airplanes driven by higher new aircraft deliveries, increased spares and aircraft modifications, and higher used aircraft sales. IDS revenues remained stable in 2005 after strong growth in 2004. BCC revenues for 2005 were essentially unchanged from 2004. Earnings from Operations The following table summarizes our earnings from operations: (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Commercial Airplanes $ 2,733 $ 1,431 $ 745 Integrated Defense Systems 3,032 3,919 2,936 Boeing Capital Corporation 291 232 183 Other (738 ) (363 ) (546 ) Unallocated expense (1,733 ) (2,407 ) (1,311 ) Global Settlement with U.S. Department of Justice (571 ) Earnings from operations $ 3,014 $ 2,812 $ 2,007 Our earnings from operations increased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily driven by improved earnings at Commercial Airplanes and lower unallocated expense. This was partially offset by a $571 million charge for global settlement with U.S. Department of Justice (see Note 22), lower IDS earnings reflecting a $569 million net gain on the sale of our Rocketdyne business in 2005 and $770 million of charges on the Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C) development program in 2006 partially offset by improved margins on other programs and a $320 million charge related to the exit of the Connexion by Boeing business recorded in Other segment (see Note 9). An increase in earnings from operations in 2005 compared to 2004 was primarily due to strong operating performance by our business segments partially offset by higher unallocated expense. Included in 2004 results is a charge of $555 million related to the United States Air Force (USAF) 767 tanker program and expenses incurred to end production of the 717 aircraft. The most significant items included in Unallocated expense are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Pension and post-retirement expense $ (472 ) $ (851 ) $ (258 ) Share-based plans expense (680 ) (999 ) (627 ) Deferred compensation expense (211 ) (186 ) (54 ) Other (370 ) (371 ) (372 ) Unallocated expense $ (1,733 ) $ (2,407 ) $ (1,311 ) We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions of $1,050 million in 2006, $1,303 million in 2005, and $451 million in 2004. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the 19 Table of Contents end of the reporting period. Accordingly, earnings from operations included $746 million, $1,225 million and $335 million of pension expense in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. A portion of pension expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension expense. Unallocated pension and other post-retirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under GAAP in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. Net periodic benefit cost related to pensions decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 mainly due to an absence of net settlement and curtailment charges partially offset by an increase in the amount of actuarial loss that was amortized. The increase in 2006 and 2005 deferred compensation plans expense is primarily due to the increase in our stock price. Higher pension and post-retirement amounts in 2005 compared to 2004 are primarily related to higher amortization of actuarial losses and net settlement and curtailment charges due to 2005 divestitures. The increase in 2005 share-based plans expense is primarily due to the increase in our stock price which resulted in additional compensation expense due to an increase in the number of performance shares meeting the price growth targets and being converted to common stock. Other Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Earnings from operations $ 3,014 $ 2,812 $ 2,007 Other income, net 420 301 288 Interest and debt expense (240 ) (294 ) (335 ) Earnings before income taxes 3,194 2,819 1,960 Income tax expense (988 ) (257 ) (140 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $ 2,206 $ 2,562 $ 1,820 Other income primarily consists of interest income. Interest income was higher in 2006 and 2005 as a result of higher interest rates and higher cash and investment balances partially offset by lower interest income related to federal income tax settlements for prior years. Interest and debt expense decreased in 2006 and 2005 due to debt repayments. The effective income tax rate of 30.9% for 2006 differed from the 2005 effective income tax rate of 9.1% primarily due to the favorable 2005 settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and the non-deduction in 2006 of the global settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. The effective income tax rate of 9.1% for 2005 was comparable to the 2004 effective income tax rate of 7.1%. Both 2005 and 2004 benefited from audit settlements and export tax benefits. 2006 is the final year for recognizing export tax benefits. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes see Note 6. Backlog Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. Contractual backlog increased by $55,930 million in 2006 compared to 2005 as a result of increases at Commercial Airplanes of $50,144 million, which were primarily due to new orders in excess of deliveries for the 737NG, 747 and 787 airplanes, and increases at IDS of $5,786 million which were driven by funding received from new orders and existing contracts for C-17, F/A-18, Integrated Logistics Chinook support, and Proprietary. 20 Table of Contents Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. Funding that is subsequently received is moved to contractual backlog. The decrease in IDS unobligated backlog of $10,584 million during 2006 compared to 2005 is primarily due to funding released from new orders and existing contracts on F/A-18, Future Combat Systems (FCS), C-17, and Proprietary. Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Air travel growth is driven by a combination of economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Air traffic growth continues to exceed its long-term trend due to strong performance of these key drivers. Global economic growth, the primary driver of air traffic growth, remained above long-term trend for the third straight year in 2006. Evidence of increasing liberalization can be seen in the declining restrictions on flights between countries, increasing private ownership of airlines and reduced regulation of competition within markets. Looking forward, our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger traffic, and 6% per year for cargo traffic based on projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increasing utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $2.6 trillion market for 27,200 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The airline industry is becoming increasingly competitive resulting in airlines focusing on increasing productivity and improving service levels. Airlines are changing many aspects of their operations including simplifying fleets, distribution, and pricing; outsourcing non-essential operations; reducing labor costs and airport costs; increasing asset utilization; and developing new business models through innovations in network structure, fare structures, service levels and distribution networks. Such changes are providing new opportunities for airline industry suppliers. Worldwide, many airlines continue reporting operating profits although performance varies significantly by region and business model. Recent industry financials generally show increasing unit revenues and rising fares. Cost-cutting initiatives and efficiency improvements are helping many airlines remain profitable despite intense competition and high fuel prices. Fuel costs now comprise one quarter of airline operating costs compared to less than 15% three years ago. Overall, the industry is forecast to lose half a billion dollars in 2006, but return to profitability in 2007. Many airlines that are growing to meet increased demand are acquiring new capacity from manufacturers. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including disease outbreaks (such as avian flu), the threat of terrorism, global economic imbalances, increasing global environmental concerns and fuel prices. Fuel prices are forecast to remain elevated and volatile in the near-term due to strong demand driven by economic growth and minimal surplus capacity to cushion against supply shocks. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long-term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has continued to enable low-cost airlines to gain market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. 21 Table of Contents Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately two-thirds of Commercial Airplanes’ sales and contractual backlog are from customers based outside the United States. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. A decline of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies puts pressure on competitors’ revenues and profits. Competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. Airbus has recently announced such initiatives targeting a two-year reduction in its development cycle and a 20% increase in overall productivity by 2010. If the U.S. dollar strengthens, Airbus can use the extra efficiency to develop new products and gain market share. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively and maintain satisfactory margins.

The years 2005 and 2004 were retroactively adjusted for comparative purposes. See Note 1. Revenues The increase in revenue of approximately $7,100 million in 2006 from 2005 was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries, including model mix changes, of $6,820 million, increased aircraft modification and spares business of $873 million offset by $593 million primarily attributable to lower revenue from aircraft trading. The increase in revenue of $1,440 million in 2005 from 2004 was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries, including model mix changes, of $845 million, used airplane sales of $302 million and $293 million primarily attributable to aircraft modification, and spares. Increased deliveries in 2005 were achieved despite delivering 29 fewer than expected airplanes due to the IAM strike during the month of September 2005. This resulted in approximately $2,000 million lower revenue than anticipated for 2005. 22 Table of Contents Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31, including deliveries under operating lease, which are identified by parentheses, were as follows: 717 737 NG 747 757 767 777 Total 2006 Cumulative Deliveries 155 2,136 1,380 1,049 947 604 Deliveries 5 (3) 302 * 14 – 12 * 65 398 2005 Cumulative Deliveries 150 1,834 1,366 1,049 935 539 Deliveries 13 (5) 212 * 13 2 10 * 40 290 2004 Cumulative Deliveries 137 1,622 1,353 1,047 925 499 Deliveries 12 (6) 202 * 15 11 9 (1) 36 285 * Intracompany deliveries were two 767 aircraft and eight 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2006, two 767 aircraft and two 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2005 and three 737 Next-Generation aircraft in 2004. Earnings from Operations The $1,302 million increase in earnings from operations in 2006 over the comparable period of 2005 was primarily attributable to earnings of $1,781 million on increased revenue from new aircraft deliveries and $315 million in increased earnings primarily attributable to aircraft modifications. In addition cost performance improved by $226 million. Such items were offset by increased research and development costs of $1,088 million. In 2005 we had a loss on the sale of Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma operations of $68 million. The IAM strike resulted in lower operating earnings in 2005 due to 29 fewer than expected airplane deliveries. The $686 million increase in earnings from operations in 2005 over the comparable period of 2004 was primarily attributable to earnings on increased revenue from new aircraft deliveries of $265 million and $135 million of increased revenue primarily attributable to aircraft modification. In addition, margin improved $414 million mainly due to improved cost performance, which was offset by increased research and development costs of $361 million and other period costs of $174 million, and a loss on the sale of Wichita, Tulsa and McAlester operations of $68 million. In 2004, we also had charges of $280 million resulting from the decision to complete production of the 717 program and $195 million of the 767 USAF Tanker program charge. Backlog The backlog increase in 2006 related to orders in excess of deliveries for 737NG, 747 and 787, while the increase in 2005 related to orders in excess of deliveries for 737NG, 777 and 787. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which do not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity decreases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also decreases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates, thus increasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. 23 Table of Contents The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The table below provides details as of December 31: Program 717 737 NG 747 757 767 777 787 2006 Program accounting quantities 156 3,200 1,449 1,050 985 900 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 1,560 116 28 299 448 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 155 3,696 1,496 1,049 975 903 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A 8 N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 1 % N/A 2005 Program accounting quantities 156 2,800 1,424 1,050 971 800 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 5 1,123 58 30 288 287 Cumulative firm orders (CFO) 2 155 2,957 1,424 1,049 965 827 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A 3 N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 0 % N/A 2004 Program accounting quantities 156 2,400 1,400 1,050 959 700 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 18 771 27 2 25 167 52 Cumulative firm orders (CFO) 2 155 2,393 1,380 1,049 950 666 Anticipated orders N/A 5 19 N/A 6 34 Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A 0 % 1 % N/A 1 % 5 % * The accounting quantity for the 787 program will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2008. 1 Firm orders represent new aircraft purchase agreements where the customers’ rights to cancel without penalty have expired. Typically customer rights to cancel without penalty include the customer receiving approval from its Board of Directors, shareholders, government and completing financing arrangements. All such cancellation rights must be satisfied or expired prior to recording a firm order even if satisfying such conditions are highly certain. Firm orders exclude option aircraft and aircraft with cancellation rights. 2 Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. 737 Next-Generation The accounting quantity for the 737 Next-Generation program increased by 400 units during 2006 due to the program’s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. 747 Program In November 2005, we launched the 747-8 family, which includes the 747-8 Intercontinental passenger airplane and the 747-8 Freighter. This launch and additional firm orders have extended the life of this program and have also solidified product strategy. The accounting quantity for the 747 program increased by 25 units during 2006. During 2006 we completed firm configuration of the 747-8 freighter and the same is expected for the passenger version in 2007. Deliveries of the first 747-8 freighter and intercontinental passenger airplane are targeted for late 2009 and late 2010. 767 Program During 2005 and 2006 the 767 program obtained additional orders, including 10 firm orders during 2006. In addition, on February 5, 2007, a customer announced its plans to order 27 767-300 Extended Range Freighters. We continue pursuing market opportunities for additional 767 sales. 24 Table of Contents 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 100 units during 2006 as a result of the program’s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. 787 Program As we progress toward first flight and entry into service of the 787, we continue to manage pressures with respect to weight, schedule, and supplier implementation as they arise. There are inherent risks associated with the development and production of any new airplane, which can impact expectations. But we still continue to expect delivery of the 787 on schedule and in accordance with our contractual obligations. We are preparing for the first test flight of the 787 in 2007, and for entry into service in 2008. A key milestone of the program was achieved in 2006 with the initial flight of the first 747-400 Large Cargo Freighter (LCF), called the DreamLifter. These specially-modified freighters will transport major composite structures of the 787 airplanes. Other key events during 2006 were the first shipment of a major assembly between supplier partners and the introduction of a digital computer simulation of the entire 787 production and assembly process. Completed programs 717 Program On January 12, 2005, we announced our decision to complete production of the 717 aircraft during 2006 due to the lack of overall market demand. The final 717 was delivered in the second quarter of 2006. 757 Program Production of the 757 program ended in October 2004. The last aircraft was delivered in the second quarter of 2005. For additional information regarding termination liabilities remaining in Accounts payable and other liabilities for these two programs see Note 23. Deferred production costs Deferred production costs represent commercial aircraft inventory production costs incurred on in-process and delivered units in excess of the estimated average cost of such units using program accounting. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005 deferred production costs relate to the 777 program and there were no significant excess deferred production costs or unamortized tooling costs not recoverable from existing firm orders. The deferred production costs and unamortized tooling included in the 777 program’s inventory at December 31 are summarized in the following table: (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 Deferred production costs $ 871 $ 683 Unamortized tooling 329 411 As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, the balance of deferred production costs and unamortized tooling related to all other commercial aircraft programs was insignificant relative to the programs’ balance-to-go cost estimates. Fleet support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. 25 Table of Contents Research and development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Our Research and development expense increased $1,088 million and $361 million in 2006 and 2005. Research and development expense is net of development cost sharing payments received from suppliers. The increase in 2006 was due to higher spending of $636 million, primarily on 787 and 747-8, and $452 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments. The increase during 2005 was primarily due to increased spending on the 787 program and was partially offset by supplier development cost sharing payments. During the second and third quarters of 2006, we increased our research and development expense forecasts for 2006 and 2007 to reflect increasing pressures on the 787 program as well as modified and increased scope on the 747-8 program to support customer expectations. We are also continuing to develop derivatives and features for our other programs primarily the 737 and 777 programs. Integrated Defense Systems Business Environment and Trends IDS consists of three capabilities-driven businesses: Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems (PE&MS), Network and Space Systems (N&SS), and Support Systems. Defense Environment Overview The U.S. is faced with continuous force deployments overseas, stability operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the requirement both to recapitalize important defense capabilities and to transform the force to take advantage of available technologies to meet the changing national security environment as outlined in the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review Report (QDR). All of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant Federal budget deficits and an administration pledge to reduce and ultimately eliminate annual deficit spending. We anticipate that the national security environment will remain challenging for at least the next decade. Because U.S. DoD spending makes up about half of worldwide defense spending and represented approximately 84% of IDS revenue in 2006, the trends and drivers associated with the U.S. DoD budget are critical. The U.S. DoD budget has grown substantially over the past decade, particularly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Although the growth rate had moderated in recent years, the 2008 submittal equates to an 11% increase over the projected 2007 enacted level. The President’s request for fiscal year 2008 is $481 billion, excluding the additional $142 billion request to continue the fight in the Global War on Terror (GWOT) in fiscal year 2008. In the past emergency supplementals had been used to cover the on-going costs of the GWOT. In addition to the fiscal year 2008 budget request the President also submitted a fiscal year 2007 Emergency Supplemental requesting $93 billion to cover operations in the GWOT for the remainder of fiscal year 2007. This Supplemental is in addition to the $70 billion previously provided by Congress. The Procurement account continues to see growth with a request of $102 billion, a 25% increase over 2007, while the 26 Table of Contents Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E) account remains flat at $75 billion. (All projections and percentage increases are made without taking inflation into account and without accounting for Supplemental funding.) Even though we continue to see some growth in the U.S. DoD budget, it is unlikely that the U.S. DoD will be able to fully fund the hardware programs already in development as well as new initiatives in order to address the capability gaps identified in the 2006 QDR. This imbalance between future costs of hardware programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the U.S. DoD and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules, restructuring programs, and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding. We expect the U.S. DoD will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies that emphasize jointness, network-centric operations, persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, long-range strike, special operations, unmanned systems, precision guided kinetic and non-kinetic weapons, and continued privatization of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. Consolidation of contractor-provided U.S. Government launch capabilities was completed with the formation of the United Launch Alliance L.L.C. (ULA) joint venture in 2006. This consolidation was driven by the limited schedule of government launches as well as the downturn in the commercial launch market. Launch contractors had built business cases around the government market being supplemented by a robust commercial market, but as the commercial market declined these business cases were re-evaluated. The U.S. Government has an assured access to space policy which requires that two separate vehicles be available for use. The ULA joint venture is intended to provide this assurance. Civil Space Transportation and Exploration Environment NASA has had stable but very little growth in their funding in this decade. NASA’s fiscal year 2006 appropriation of $16.6 billion was approximately equal to the fiscal year 2005 funding level, and presently the agency is operating under a “Continuing Resolution” in 2007. NASA’s budget remains focused on needed funds for Space Shuttle Operations, International Space Station, and new initiatives associated with the Vision for Space Exploration. We anticipate funding levels to remain in the $16 billion range in the near future. NASA is continuing to pursue elements of the Vision for Space Exploration, which will provide additional opportunities. Commercial Satellite Environment The commercial satellite market has strengthened since the downturn earlier in the decade and is expected to stabilize with replacement demand through the end of the decade. The market remains extremely competitive however, with overcapacity across the overall industry and strong pressure on pricing. We will continue to pursue profitable commercial satellite opportunities where the customer values our technical expertise and unique solutions. Integrated Defense Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 32,439 $ 31,106 $ 30,739 % of Total Company Revenues 53 % 58 % 60 % Operating Earnings $ 3,032 $ 3,919 $ 2,936 Operating Margins 9.3 % 12.6 % 9.6 % Research and Development $ 791 $ 855 $ 834 Contractual Backlog $ 42,291 $ 36,505 $ 39,296 Unobligated Backlog $ 33,424 $ 44,008 $ 47,472 27 Table of Contents Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Revenues IDS revenues increased 4% in 2006 and 1% in 2005 as growth in both PE&MS and Support Systems was partially offset by lower volume in N&SS. Operating Earnings IDS operating earnings decreased by $887 million in 2006 from 2005 reflecting a $569 million net gain on the sale of Rocketdyne in 2005 and $770 million of charges on the AEW&C development program in 2006 partially offset by improved margins on other programs. Operating earnings increased by $983 million in 2005 from 2004 primarily due to the net gain on the Rocketdyne sale in 2005 in addition to stable performance in the commercial satellite business compared to 2004, when losses were recorded resulting from cost growth due to technical and quality issues and write-downs of slow-moving inventory. Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. IDS total backlog decreased 6% in 2006, from $80,513 million to $75,715 million, primarily due to decreases in unobligated backlog of $10,584 million which resulted from funding released from new orders and existing contracts on F/A-18, FCS, C-17, and Proprietary, offset by increases in contractual backlog of $5,786 million which were driven by funding received from new orders and existing contracts for C-17, F/A-18, Integrated Logistics Chinook support, and Proprietary. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), FCS, P-8A (P-8A, formerly Multi-mission Maritime Aircraft), Proprietary programs, Airborne Laser, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals, and the E/A-18G. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed, which could trigger termination-for-default provisions, the loss of satellite on-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of these programs include AEW&C, 767 Tanker, commercial and military satellites, Vigilare and High Frequency Modernisation. 28 Table of Contents Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 14,350 $ 13,510 $ 12,835 % of Total Company Revenues 23 % 25 % 25 % Operating Earnings $ 1,238 $ 1,755 $ 1,697 Operating Margins 8.6 % 13.0 % 13.2 % Research and Development $ 404 $ 440 $ 420 Contractual Backlog $ 24,988 $ 21,815 $ 21,539 Unobligated Backlog $ 9,194 $ 15,189 $ 20,885 Revenues PE&MS revenues increased 6% in 2006 and 5% in 2005 primarily due to additional aircraft deliveries and other volume. The revenue growth of $840 million in 2006 was driven by higher deliveries of F-15 and Apache and higher volume of P-8A, F-22, and Chinook, partially offset by reduced revenues of AEW&C. The revenue growth of $675 million in 2005 was driven by higher deliveries on F-15 and Apache and higher volume and milestone completions on P-8A and AEW&C, partially offset by fewer deliveries on F/A-18 and lower volume resulting from the Comanche termination. Deliveries of new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 C-17 Globemaster III 16 16 16 F/A-18E/F Super Hornet 42 42 48 T-45 Training Systems 13 10 7 F-15 Eagle 12 6 3 CH-47 Chinook 2 – – C-40 Clipper 1 2 3 AH-64 Apache 31 12 3 Total New-Build Production Aircraft 117 88 80 Operating Earnings PE&MS operating earnings decreased $517 million in 2006 driven by the $770 million AEW&C charges mentioned above, which were partially offset by earnings from revenue growth, favorable contract mix, and reduced Company Sponsored Research & Development (CSR&D) expenditures on the 767 Tanker program. Operating earnings increased 3% in 2005 driven by earnings from revenue growth and reduced CSR&D expenditures on 767 Tankers in 2005 and charges recorded in 2004 to write off pre-contract development costs on the 767 USAF Tanker program. Research and Development The PE&MS segment continues to focus its research and development resources where it can use its customer knowledge, technical strength and large-scale integration capabilities to provide transformational solutions to meet the war fighter’s enduring needs. Research and Development has remained consistent over the past several years. Research and development activities leverage our capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to enhance our customers’ capabilities in the areas of situational awareness and survivability. These efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness and interoperability, and improving affordability, reliability and economic ownership. Continued research and development investments in unmanned technology and systems have enabled the demonstration of multi-vehicle coordinated flight and distributed control of high-performance unmanned combat air vehicles. Research and development in advanced weapons technologies emphasizes, among other things, precision guidance and multi-mode targeting. Research and development investments in the Global Tanker Transport Aircraft program represent a significant 29 Table of Contents opportunity to provide state-of-the-art refueling capabilities to domestic and non-U.S. customers. Investments were also made to support various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance business opportunities including P-8A and AEW&C aircraft. Other research and development efforts include upgrade and technology insertions to network-enable and enhance the capability and competitiveness of current product lines such as the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15E Eagle, AH-64 Apache, CH-47 Chinook and C-17 Globemaster III. Backlog PE&MS total backlog decreased 8% from 2005 to 2006 primarily due to deliveries and sales on F/A-18 and F-15 from multi-year contracts awarded in prior years. Total backlog decreased 13% from 2004 to 2005 primarily due to deliveries and sales on C-17, F/A-18 and P-8A, and partially offset by additional F-15 and Chinook orders. Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on PE&MS operations include the following: AEW&C During 2006 we recorded charges of $770 million on our international Airborne Early Warning and Control program. This development program, also known as Wedgetail in Australia and Peace Eagle in Turkey, consists of a 737-700 aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems, some of which have never been installed on an airplane before. Wedgetail includes six aircraft and Peace Eagle includes four aircraft. This is an advanced and complex fixed-price development program involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability. The second-quarter charge of $496 million included estimated additional program costs and reductions in expected pricing caused by technical complexities which resulted in schedule delays and cost growth and increased the risk of late delivery penalties. The financial impact recorded in that quarter resulted from a detailed analysis of flight test data along with a series of additional rigorous technical and cost reviews after flight testing ramped up. The hardware and software development and integration had not progressed as quickly as we planned, resulting in the delivery for the first two aircraft being delayed 15 months. We reorganized the program to improve systems engineering and integration and we strengthened the leadership team in both program management and engineering. In the fourth quarter of 2006, after a revised estimate of technical progress by us and our subcontractors, we determined that program subsystems and software development had not matured as we had anticipated earlier in the year. We recorded a charge of an additional $274 million, reflecting further program delays of up to six months. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the most recent cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed. C-17 As of December 31, 2006, we have delivered a total of 159 of the 190 C-17s ordered by the U.S. Air Force, with final deliveries scheduled for 2009. Despite pending orders, which would extend deliveries of the C-17 to mid-2009, it is reasonably possible that we will decide in 2007 to suspend work on long-lead items from suppliers and/or to complete production of the C-17 if further orders are not received. We are still evaluating the full financial impact of a production shut-down, including any recovery that would be available from the government. 767 Tanker Program The 767 Tanker Program has orders for eight 767 Tankers, four from the Italian Air Force and four from the Japan Self Defense Agency. The USAF is continuing to pursue a replacement for the KC-135 tanker and has identified it as its top acquisition priority for 2007. In addition, the Pentagon requested funding for the development phase of the program in its 2008 budget request in February 2007. We remain firmly committed to the USAF Tanker program and are ready to support our customer in whatever decision is made regarding the recapitalization of the nation’s current aerial refueling fleet. 30 Table of Contents Network and Space Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 11,980 $ 12,254 $ 13,023 % of Total Company Revenues 19 % 23 % 25 % Operating Earnings $ 958 $ 1,399 $ 577 Operating Margins 8.0 % 11.4 % 4.4 % Research and Development $ 301 $ 334 $ 357 Contractual Backlog $ 8,001 $ 6,324 $ 10,923 Unobligated Backlog $ 23,723 $ 27,634 $ 25,019 Revenues N&SS revenues decreased 2% in 2006 and 6% in 2005 as significant growth in FCS and higher Delta IV volume were offset by lower volume in Proprietary and GMD as well as the divestiture of our Rocketdyne business. Additional impacts resulted from fewer milestone completions in our commercial satellite business in 2006 and the completion of a Homeland Security contract in 2005. Launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows: 2006 2005 2004 Delta II 2 2 4 Delta IV 3 – – Commercial/Civil Satellites 4 3 2 Operating Earnings N&SS operating earnings decreased $441 million from 2005 to 2006 and increased $822 million from 2004 to 2005 driven by significant items in all three periods. The decrease from 2005 to 2006 was driven by the $569 million net gain on the Rocketdyne sale and higher contract values for Delta IV launch contracts in 2005, partially offset by increased earnings in the FCS program in 2006. The increase from 2004 to 2005 was driven by the favorable Rocketdyne and Delta IV impacts in 2005 mentioned above, while losses were recorded in our commercial satellite business in 2004 caused by performance issues due to cost growth from technical and quality issues and write-offs of slow-moving inventory. N&SS operating earnings include equity earnings of $71 million, $72 million, and $70 million from the United Space Alliance joint venture in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. Divestitures On February 28, 2005, we completed the stock sale of EDD to L-3 Communications. On August 2, 2005 we completed the sale of our Rocketdyne business to United Technologies Corporation. See Note 9 Exit Activity and Divestitures. Research and Development The N&SS research and development funding remains focused on the development of communications and command and control capabilities that support a network-centric architecture approach for our various government customers. We are investing in the communications market to enable connectivity between existing air/ground platforms, increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and leverage innovative communications concepts. Key programs in this area include JTRS, FCS, GPS, and Transformational Communications System. Investments were also made to support concepts that will lead to the development of next-generation space intelligence systems. Along with increased funding to support these areas of architecture and network-centric capabilities development, we also maintained our investment levels in global missile defense and advanced missile defense concepts and technologies. Backlog N&SS total backlog decreased 7% from 2005 to 2006 driven by sales from a multi-year order received in prior years on FCS. Total backlog decreased 6% from 2004 to 2005 driven by sales from multi-year orders received in prior years on GMD and FCS, partially offset by new orders on Proprietary programs. 31 Table of Contents Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on N&SS operations include the following: United Launch Alliance On December 1, 2006, we completed the transaction with Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) to create a 50/50 joint venture named United Launch Alliance L.L.C. (ULA). ULA combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. Government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Atlas rockets. In connection with the transaction, we contributed assets and liabilities of $1,609 million and $695 million, respectively, to ULA. These amounts are subject to adjustment pending final review of the respective parties’ contributions. Any difference between the book value of our investment and our proportionate share of ULA’s net assets would be recognized ratably in future years. We also entered into an inventory supply agreement with ULA that provides for the purchase by ULA from us of Boeing Delta inventories totaling $1,860 million by March 31, 2021. We and Lockheed each will provide ULA with initial cash contributions of up to $25 million, and we each have agreed to extend a line of credit to ULA of up to $200 million to support its working capital requirements. In connection with the transaction, we and Lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain U.S. Government contracts to ULA as of the closing date. We and Lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the U.S. government. We agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability of $1,375 million of Boeing Delta inventories included in contributed assets plus $1,860 million of inventory subject to the inventory supply agreement. In addition, in the event ULA is unable to obtain re-pricing of certain contracts which we contributed to ULA and to which we believe ULA is entitled, we will be responsible for any shortfall and may record up to $322 million in pre-tax losses. ULA is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. N&SS 2006 revenues include $727 million related to Delta rockets and formation of ULA will reduce N&SS revenues in 2007. We do not expect ULA to have a material impact to our earnings, cash flows, or financial position for 2007. Sea Launch The Sea Launch venture, in which we are a 40% partner, provides ocean-based launch services to commercial satellite customers. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the venture conducted five successful launches. We have issued credit guarantees to creditors of the Sea Launch venture to assist it in obtaining financing. In the event we are required to perform on these guarantees, we believe we can recover a portion of the cost (estimated at $486 million) through guarantees from the other venture partners. The components of this exposure are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) EstimatedMaximumExposure EstablishedReserves EstimatedProceedsfromRecourse EstimatedNetExposure Credit Guarantees $ 471 $ 188 $ 283 Partner Loans (Principal and Interest) 451 271 180 Advances to Provide for Future Launches 76 $ 76 Trade Receivable from Sea Launch 311 289 22 Performance Guarantees 33 20 13 Other Receivables from Sea Launch 45 38 3 4 $ 1,387 $ 786 $ 486 $ 115 We made no additional capital contributions to the Sea Launch venture during the year ended December 31, 2006. We suspended recording equity losses after writing our investment in and direct loans to Sea Launch down to zero in 2001 and accruing our obligation for third-party guarantees on Sea Launch indebtedness. We 32 Table of Contents are not obligated to provide any further financial support to the Sea Launch venture. However, in the event that we do extend additional financial support to Sea Launch in the future, we will recognize suspended losses as appropriate. A Sea Launch Zenit-3SL vehicle, carrying a Boeing-built satellite, experienced an anomaly during launch on January 30, 2007. The impact to Sea Launch operations, including the remaining launches scheduled for 2007 is not yet known. Based on our preliminary assessment, we do not believe that this anomaly will have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. Satellites The Boeing-built NSS-8 satellite was declared a total loss due to an anomaly during launch on January 30, 2007. The NSS-8 satellite was insured for $200 million. We believe the NSS-8 loss was the result of an insured event and have so notified our insurance carriers. See the discussions of Boeing Satellite International, Inc. (BSSI) litigation/arbitration with ICO Global Communications (Operations), Ltd., Thuraya Satellite Telecommunications, Telesat Canada, and Space Communications Corporation in Note 22. Support Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 6,109 $ 5,342 $ 4,881 % of Total Company Revenues 10 % 10 % 10 % Operating Earnings $ 836 $ 765 $ 662 Operating Margins 13.7 % 14.3 % 13.6 % Research and Development $ 86 $ 81 $ 57 Contractual Backlog $ 9,302 $ 8,366 $ 6,834 Unobligated Backlog $ 507 $ 1,185 $ 1,568 Revenues Support Systems revenues increased 14% in 2006 and 9% in 2005 driven by growth throughout the segment. The increase of $767 million in 2006 was due to higher Integrated Logistics (IL) volume on programs such as C-17 and increased program volume resulting from Aviall, which we acquired in the third quarter; higher International program volume resulting from our increased ownership in Alsalam Aircraft Co. (Alsalam); and volume on Maintenance, Modification, & Upgrade (MM&U) programs such as AC-130. The increase of $461 million in 2005 was due to higher volume on MM&U programs such as F-15 and AC-130 and IL programs such as Chinook and C-17. In the second quarter of 2006 we increased our ownership interest in Alsalam, which operates as a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul facility for various military and commercial aircraft. As a result, we began consolidating Alsalam’s financial statements, which generated revenues of $137 million during the last three quarters of 2006. Operating Earnings Support Systems operating earnings increased 9% in 2006 and 16% in 2005 driven by the revenue increases mentioned above in addition to a different contract mix. Research and Development Support Systems continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including Engineering and Logistic Services, MM&U, Supply Chain Services, Training and Support Systems, and Advanced Logistics Services, as well as on moving into the innovative Network Centric Logistics areas. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative and disciplined tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Examples of successful programs stemming from these 33 Table of Contents investment strategies include the C-17 Globemaster Sustainment Partnership, the F/A-18 Integrated Readiness Support Teaming program, and the F-15 Singapore Performance Based Logistics contract. Backlog Support Systems total backlog increased 3% from 2005 to 2006 driven by a large IL order for Chinook support. Total backlog increased 14% from 2004 to 2005 driven by orders for new business offsetting sales on various IL programs. Boeing Capital Corporation Segment Business Environment and Trends BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2006 totaled $8,034 million, which was substantially collateralized by our commercial aircraft. While worldwide traffic levels are well above those in the past, the effects of higher fuel prices continue to impact the airline industry. At the same time, the credit ratings of some airlines, particularly in the United States, have remained at low levels. Despite positive factors including passenger load at record high levels, a limited supply of economically viable used aircraft and, increasing lease rates, values as measured by reference to published reports from multiple external appraisers for the various aircraft types that are collateral in BCC’s portfolio generally have not increased. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 1,850 commercial jet aircraft (9.9% of current world fleet) continue to be parked, including both in production and out-of-production aircraft types of which over 50% are not expected to return to service. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. At December 31, 2006, $2,590 million and $1,171 million of BCC’s portfolio was collateralized by 717 and 757 aircraft. During 2006, BCC recognized an expense of $15 million to increase the valuation allowance resulting from a decrease in the collateral value of the 717 aircraft. See Note 10. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 2004 Revenues $ 1,025 $ 966 $ 959 Operating Earnings $ 291 $ 232 $ 183 Operating Margins 28 % 24 % 19 % Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of interest from financing receivables and notes, and lease income from equipment under operating lease. BCC’s revenues increased $59 million in 2006, primarily due to an increase in investment income of $40 million from the sale or repayment at maturity of certain investments and a higher gain on the sale of aircraft and certain investments in notes receivable of $23 million. These increases were partially offset by a decline in interest and lease income due to decreases in the weighted average balance of the related portfolio. BCC’s revenues were essentially unchanged in 2005 compared with 2004. Operating earnings BCC’s operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings increased by $59 million in 2006 primarily due to increased revenues. The increase in operating earnings in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily due to a lower asset impairment expense and the absence of debt redemption costs partially offset by increased depreciation expense. 34 Table of Contents Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC: (Dollars in millions) 2006 2005 BCC Customer Financing and Investment Portfolio $ 8,034 $ 9,206 Valuation Allowance as a % of Total Receivables 2.4 % 2.0 % Debt $ 5,590 $ 6,322 Debt-to-Equity Ratio 5.0-to-1 5.0-to-1 BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2006 decreased from December 31, 2005 due to portfolio run-off and sale of certain portfolio assets. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, BCC had $259 million and $47 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease of which $253 million and $6 million had firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. Additionally, leases with a carrying value of approximately $144 million are scheduled to terminate in the next 12 months and the related aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended. BCC enters into certain transactions with the Other segment in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies. Finance Restructurings Delta Air Lines, Inc. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Delta Air Lines, Inc. (Delta) accounted for $135 million and $161 million of BCC’s total assets. At December 31, 2006, the Delta portfolio consisted of an investment in an Enhanced Equipment Trust Certificate (EETC) secured by 12 aircraft. Delta retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. As of December 31, 2006, Delta has made the contractually required payments relating to the remaining EETC held by BCC. BCC does not expect that the Delta bankruptcy, including the possible return of some or all of the aircraft financed, will have a material effect on its future earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. Northwest Airlines, Inc. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, Northwest Airlines, Inc. (Northwest) accounted for $349 million and $494 million of BCC’s total assets. At December 31, 2006, the Northwest portfolio consisted of notes receivable on six aircraft and two additional notes receivable. Northwest retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On November 8, 2006, the bankruptcy court approved the restructured terms of certain obligations relating to the notes receivable. At December 31, 2006, Northwest is current on payments relating to the notes receivable held by BCC. We do not expect the Northwest bankruptcy, including the impact of any restructurings, to have a material effect on our future earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. In addition to the customers discussed above, certain other customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. BCC has not reached agreement on any restructuring requests that it believes would have a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. Other Segment Other segment operating losses were $738 million during 2006 as compared to losses of $363 million in 2005. Major factors contributing to operating results of the segment are described below. During the third quarter of 2006, we announced that we would exit the Connexion by Boeing high speed broadband communications business having completed a detailed business and market 35 Table of Contents analysis. Our decision resulted in a pre-tax charge of $320 million (See Note 9). We have not reached final settlements with all customers or suppliers. We do not believe the final settlements will have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. In 2006, the Other segment recorded valuation allowances for customer financing losses of $24 million due to deteriorated airline credit ratings and depressed aircraft values. In 2005, such provisions were $98 million, which consisted of losses of $76 million and $22 million, due to decreases in the collateral values of the 717 and 757, respectively. In 2006, the Other segment recorded an increase in environmental expense of $68 million primarily related to a write-down of previously capitalized environmental costs. In 2005, the Other segment recognized earnings of $63 million associated with the buyout of several operating lease aircraft by a customer. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) Year ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Net earnings $ 2,215 $ 2,572 $ 1,872 Non-cash items 3,097 3,494 3,126 Changes in working capital 2,187 934 (1,494 ) Net cash provided by operating activities 7,499 7,000 3,504 Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities (3,186 ) (98 ) (1,446 ) Net cash used by financing activities (3,645 ) (4,657 ) (3,487 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 38 (37 ) Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 706 2,208 (1,429 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 5,412 3,204 4,633 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 6,118 $ 5,412 $ 3,204 Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $499 million to $7,499 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to working capital improvements which were partially offset by lower Net earnings. The working capital improvements in 2006 compared with 2005 reflect $1,340 million of lower pension contributions in 2006. Working capital reductions in 2006 also reflect higher advances driven by commercial airplane orders, decreased investment in customer financing, and low income tax payments which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other liability. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $7,000 million in 2005 from $3,504 million in 2004 primarily due to lower pension contributions, decreased investment in customer financing, and higher advances and billings in excess of related costs, partially offset by increased investment in inventories. Investing activities Cash used for investing activities increased to $3,186 million in 2006 from $98 million in 2005. The increase is primarily due to our investment of $1,738 million in the 2006 acquisition of Aviall, Inc. (Aviall), net of $42 million of cash acquired, and $458 million of assumed debt, in an all-cash merger. The assumed debt was subsequently repaid on the acquisition closing date. In 2005, we received proceeds of $1,676 million, primarily from the disposition of our Commercial Airplanes 36 Table of Contents operations in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, and the sale of Rocketdyne. In 2004, we received proceeds of $2,017 million from the sale of substantially all of the assets related to BCC’s Commercial Financial Services business. During 2004, we invested $3,000 million of cash in an externally managed portfolio of investment grade fixed income instruments. The portfolio is diversified and highly liquid and primarily consists of investment fixed income instruments (U.S. dollar debt obligations of the United States Treasury, other government agencies, corporations, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities). As of December 31, 2006, our externally managed portfolio of investment grade fixed income instruments had an average duration of 1.6 years. The investments are classified as available for sale. Financing activities Cash used by financing activities decreased to $3,645 million in 2006 from $4,657 million in 2005 primarily due to lower common share repurchases. Cash used by financing activities increased by $1,170 million in 2005 from $3,487 million in 2004 primarily due to a $2,125 million increase in common share repurchases partially offset by lower debt repayments. During 2006, we repurchased 21,184,202 shares at an average price of $80.18 in our open market share repurchase program, 3,749,377 shares at an average price of $80.28 as part of the ShareValue Trust distribution, and 49,288 shares in stock swaps. During 2005 and 2004, 45,217,300 shares and 14,708,856 shares were repurchased at an average price of $63.60 and $51.09 in our open market share repurchase program, and 33,660 shares and 50,657 shares were repurchased in stock swaps. In 2006, we repaid $1,681 million of debt, including $713 million of debt held at BCC and $458 million of debt assumed in the Aviall acquisition. In 2005 and 2004, we repaid $1,378 million and $2,208 million of debt. Repayments in 2004 included BCC’s redemption of $1,000 million face value of its outstanding senior notes, which had a carrying value of $999 million. BCC recognized a net loss of $42 million related to this early debt redemption. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings are summarized below: Fitch Moody’s Standard &Poor’s Long-term: Boeing/BCC A+ A2 A+ Short-term: Boeing/BCC F-1 P-1 A-1 On March 15, 2006, Moody’s Investors Service upgraded its ratings on debt securities issued by Boeing and BCC. The short term rating was changed to P-1 from P-2 and the long term rating was changed to A2 from A3. On May 11, 2006, Standard & Poor’s revised its outlook on Boeing and BCC to positive from stable. On November 3, 2006, Standard & Poor’s increased the long-term debt ratings for Boeing and BCC to A+ from A, citing substantial cash flow and expectations that a balanced capital allocation will continue to be pursued. Capital Resources We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2006 and at December 31, 2006, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. We believe we have substantial borrowing capacity. Currently, we have $3,000 million ($1,500 million exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements. In 2006, we rolled over the 364-day revolving credit facility, reducing it from $1,500 million to $1,000 million. 37 Table of Contents Currently, there is $500 million allocated to BCC. We also rolled over the 5-year credit facility, increasing it from $1,500 million to $2,000 million, of which $1,000 million is allocated to BCC. We have $1,000 million that remains available from a shelf registration filed with the SEC on March 23, 2004, and BCC has an additional $3,421 million available for issuance, which is due to expire in November 2008. We believe our internally generated liquidity, together with access to external capital resources, will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. We and Lockheed have agreed to make available to ULA a line of credit in the amount of up to $200 million each as may be necessary from time to time to support ULA’s Expendable Launch Vehicle business during the five year period following December 1, 2006. ULA did not request any funds under the line of credit as of December 31, 2006. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158), which required recognition of the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, with a corresponding after-tax adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The adoption of SFAS 158, together with the annual remeasurement of our pension plans, resulted in a net $6,509 million decrease in Shareholders’ equity. This decrease does not affect cash flows or the funded status of our benefit plans. The covenants for our debt and credit facilities were amended to exclude the impacts of SFAS No. 158. As of December 31, 2006, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2006, and the estimated timing thereof. Contractual obligations (Dollars in millions) Total Less than1 year 1–3years 3–5years After 5years Long-term debt (including current portion) $ 9,405 $ 1,322 $ 1,260 $ 1,519 $ 5,304 Interest on debt* 6,195 557 992 814 3,832 Pension and other post retirement cash requirements 7,330 675 1,432 1,549 3,674 Capital lease obligations 153 59 31 20 43 Operating lease obligations 1,064 239 301 164 360 Purchase obligations not recorded on statement of financial position 86,254 34,926 35,076 11,940 4,312 Purchase obligations recorded on statement of financial position 10,632 9,394 518 344 376 Total contractual obligations $ 121,033 $ 47,172 $ 39,610 $ 16,350 $ 17,901 * Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2006. Variable rate debt was approximately 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2006. Pension and other postretirement benefits Pension cash requirements is an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contribution to the one plan that is funded through a trust. 38 Table of Contents Purchase obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, the agreements are not cancelable without substantial penalty. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the statements of financial position. Approximately 16% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Industrial participation agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2006, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2006, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $7.7 billion that extend through 2019. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a country outside the U.S. or customer must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the statement of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees and variable interests in unconsolidated entities. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 19. 39 Table of Contents Commercial commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2006. (Dollars in millions) Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $ 4,368 $ 2,849 $ 1,381 $ 3 $ 135 Aircraft financing commercial commitments 10,164 1,534 5,525 3,025 80 Total commercial commitments $ 14,532 $ 4,383 $ 6,906 $ 3,028 $ 215 Related to the issuance of certain standby letters of credit and surety bonds included in the above table, we received advance payments of $2,869 million as of December 31, 2006. Aircraft financing commercial commitments include commitments to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order or under option for deliveries based on estimated earliest funding dates. Based on historical experience, it is not anticipated that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers (See Note 19). Industrial Revenue Bonds We utilize Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita, Kansas and Fulton County, Georgia to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property (See Note 19). Critical Accounting Policies and Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented Contract Accounting Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. Government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contract’s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the 40 Table of Contents underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in IDS for all of 2006 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1.0%, it would have increased or decreased income for the year by approximately $324 million. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured parts, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs. Underlying all estimates used for program accounting is the forecasted market and corresponding production rates. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are recognized on a prospective basis. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for all commercial airplane programs for all of 2006 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for 2006 by approximately $243 million. Aircraft Valuation Used aircraft under trade-in commitments The fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft specific data such as, model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. Trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. This process begins years before the return of the aircraft. On a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. 41 Table of Contents Based on the best market information available at the time, it is probable that we would be obligated to perform on trade-in commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $19 million and $72 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Accounts payable and other liabilities included $22 million at December 31, 2005, which represents the exposure related to these trade-in commitments. Had the estimate of trade-in value used to calculate our obligation related to probable trade-in commitments been 10% lower than our actual assessment, using a measurement date of December 31, 2006, Accounts payable and other liabilities would have increased by approximately $2 million. We continually update our assessment of the likelihood of our trade-in aircraft purchase commitments and continue to monitor all these commitments for adverse developments. Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease When events or circumstances indicate, we evaluate assets under operating lease or held for re-lease for impairment utilizing an expected undiscounted cash flow analysis. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including our intention to hold or dispose of an asset before the end of its economic useful life, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the aircraft or equipment, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of asset impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Had future lease rates on these assets we evaluate for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that no additional impairment expense would have been recognized as of December 31, 2006. We are unable to predict the likelihood of any future impairments. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventories at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in ‘Customer financing’, however, the valuation continues to be based on the lower of cost or market. Allowance for losses on receivables The allowance for losses on receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of reasonably possible and probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit reviews. Factors considered in assessing collectibility include, but are not limited to, a customer’s extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables. Had the applicable cumulative default rate been changed by plus or minus 15%, excluding impaired customers for which the default rate is maintained at 100%, we estimate that the allowance would have been higher or lower by approximately $34 million. Lease residual values Equipment under operating leases is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the lease term or projected economic life of the asset. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases. For example, a change in the estimated residual values of 1% as of December 31, 2006 could result in a cumulative pre-tax earnings impact of $20 million to be recognized over time. 42 Table of Contents Goodwill impairment Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded. At the date of our previous impairment test, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of our common stock would have had no impact on the financial statements. Postretirement plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all our employees. We also have postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements require several assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Changes in assumptions can significantly affect our future annual expense. In addition, as result of our adoption of SFAS 158, changes in assumptions could significantly increase or decrease Shareholders’ Equity (net of taxes) at future measurement dates. We use a discount rate that is based on a point-in-time estimate as of our September 30 annual measurement date. Changes in the discount rate will increase or decrease our recorded liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to Shareholders’ Equity as of the measurement date. In future reporting periods, the adjustment for a change in the discount rate will be recognized in Other comprehensive loss in the period in which it occurs. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate. As of September 30, 2006 (in millions) Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bps Pension plans Dollars Dollars Projected benefit obligation (pensions) (1,271 ) 1,555 Net periodic pension cost (145 ) 165 Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (181 ) 212 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost (14 ) 15 43 Table of Contents Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2006 pension income by approximately $108 million. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return are reflected in Shareholders’ Equity (net of taxes) as of our annual measurement date. In future reporting periods, the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return will be recognized in Other comprehensive loss in the period in which it occurs. The assumed medical trend rates have a significant affect on the following year’s expense recorded liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change. As of September 30, 2006 (in millions) Change in medical trend rateIncrease 100 bps Change in medical trend rateDecrease 100 bps Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 683 (652 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost 127 (116 ) Standards Issued and Not Yet Implemented See Note 2 in the Notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein. Contingent Items Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Most significant legal proceedings are related to matters covered by our insurance. Major contingencies are discussed in Note 22, including our contesting the default termination of the A-12 aircraft, employment and benefits litigation brought by several of our employees, and litigation/arbitration involving BSSI. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally investments, fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to interest rate changes. Additionally, Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC) uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. The principal source of BCC’s market risk relates to interest rate changes. This risk is managed by matching the profile of BCC’s liabilities with the profile of assets. Any exposure to mismatch risk is measured and managed with the use of interest rate derivatives. We do not use interest rate derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Although many of the assets, liabilities and derivatives affected by a change in interest rates are not traded, if we had an immediate, one-time, 100 basis-point increase in market rates at December 31, 2006, we estimated that the tax-adjusted net fair value of these items would have decreased by $9 million compared to a decrease of $15 million at December 31, 2005. 44 Table of Contents Based on the portfolio of other Boeing existing debt, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material. The investors in the fixed-rate debt obligations that we issue do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign currency exchange rate risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2006, a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have reduced our unrealized gains by $69 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. 45 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:32.453910
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and the second-largest defense contractor in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors located around the world. Our business strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes and Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses generate substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services that open new frontiers in aerospace. We focus on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. IDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as commercial and defense markets often offset each others’ cyclicality. BCC delivers value through supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure. In 2007, our revenues grew by 8%. Earnings from operations increased 93%. We continued to invest in key growth programs as Research and Development expense grew by 18% to $3.9 billion, reflecting increased spending on the 787 and 747-8 programs and lower cost sharing payments from suppliers. We generated operating cash flow of $9.6 billion driven by operating and working capital performance. We reduced debt by $1.3 billion and repurchased 29 million common shares. Our contractual backlog grew 37% to $297 billion, driven by 46% growth at Commercial Airplanes while our total backlog grew 31% to $327 billion. We expect continued growth in Commercial Airplane revenues and deliveries as we execute our record backlog and respond to global demand by ramping up commercial aircraft production. We expect IDS revenue to remain relatively flat in 2008 compared with 2007 and anticipate that the U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) budget growth will begin to moderate over the next several years. We are focused on improving financial performance through a combination of productivity and customer-focused growth. Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Commercial Airplanes $ 33,386 $ 28,465 $ 21,365 Integrated Defense Systems 32,080 32,439 31,106 Boeing Capital Corporation 815 1,025 966 Other 280 299 657 Accounting differences/eliminations (174 ) (698 ) (473 ) Revenues $ 66,387 $ 61,530 $ 53,621 19 Table of Contents Revenues in 2007 grew by $4,857 million, primarily due to the growth at Commercial Airplanes. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $4,921 million, primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries and increased commercial aviation support activities. IDS revenues decreased by $359 million, primarily due to lower revenues in Network and Space Systems (N&SS) resulting from the formation of the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture in 2006 and lower revenues in Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems (PE&MS), offset by growth in Support Systems. BCC revenues decreased by $210 million primarily due to a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Accounting differences/eliminations changed by $524 million primarily due to fewer Commercial Airplanes intercompany deliveries when compared with 2006. Higher consolidated revenues in 2006 were primarily due to higher new commercial aircraft deliveries. IDS revenues were up moderately in 2006 as growth in PE&MS and Support Systems was partially offset by lower volume in N&SS. BCC revenues increased in 2006 primarily due to higher investment income and higher net gain on disposal of assets. Other segment revenues decreased in 2006 as a result of the buyout of several operating lease aircraft in the amount of $369 million in 2005. Accounting differences/eliminations decreased revenues due to higher Commercial Airplanes intercompany deliveries in 2006. Earnings from Operations The following table summarizes our earnings from operations: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Commercial Airplanes $ 3,584 $ 2,733 $ 1,431 Integrated Defense Systems 3,440 3,032 3,919 Boeing Capital Corporation 234 291 232 Other (243 ) (738 ) (363 ) Unallocated Expense (1,185 ) (1,733 ) (2,407 ) Settlement with U.S. Department of Justice, net of accruals (571 ) Earnings from operations $ 5,830 $ 3,014 $ 2,812 Operating earnings in 2007 improved by $2,816 million compared with 2006. The increase is partly due to the $571 million global settlement with U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DoJ) that occurred in the second quarter of 2006. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $851 million compared with the same period in 2006, primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries, commercial aviation support activities and improved cost performance offset by increased research and development expense. Commercial Airplanes’ research and development expense increased by $572 million to $2,962 million compared with the same period 2006, primarily due to spending on the 787 and 747-8 programs. IDS earnings increased by $408 million compared with 2006. The increase is primarily due to 2006 charges of $770 million in the PE&MS segment related to Airborne Early Warning & Control (AEW&C), partially offset by lower 2007 earnings on several programs in the PE&MS and N&SS segments. BCC operating earnings decreased $57 million reflecting lower revenues partially offset by a recovery of losses and lower expenses. Other segment earnings improved by $495 million primarily due to the absence of losses related to Connexion by Boeing, which included a charge of $320 million to exit this business in 2006. Lower unallocated expense in 2007 contributed $548 million to the 2007 earnings improvement. Operating earnings increased in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily driven by improved earnings at Commercial Airplanes resulting from higher revenue from new aircraft deliveries, increased earnings from commercial aviation support business and improved cost performance. Lower unallocated expense in 2006 also contributed to the 2006 earnings increase. This was partially offset by a $571 million charge for 20 Table of Contents global settlement with U.S. DoJ, lower IDS earnings reflecting a $569 million net gain on the sale of our Rocketdyne business in 2005 and $770 million of charges on the AEW&C development program in 2006 partially offset by improved margins on other programs and a $320 million charge related to the exit of the Connexion by Boeing business recorded in Other segment. The most significant items included in Unallocated expense are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Pension and other postretirement $ (686 ) $ (472 ) $ (851 ) Share-based plans (233 ) (680 ) (999 ) Deferred compensation (51 ) (211 ) (186 ) Other (215 ) (370 ) (371 ) Unallocated expense $ (1,185 ) $ (1,733 ) $ (2,407 ) We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of $1,773 million, $1,663 million and $1,852 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, earnings from operations included $1,730 million, $1,227 million and $1,893 million in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. A portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense. Unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under GAAP in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. Pension and other postretirement expense increased during 2007 when compared with 2006 primarily due to increased overall pension costs recognized in inventory as of December 31, 2006, which are subsequently expensed in cost of sales in 2007. Pension and other postretirement expense decreased in 2006 compared with 2005 mainly due to an absence of net settlement and curtailment charges partially offset by an increase in the amount of actuarial loss that was amortized. The reduction in Share-based plans expense is primarily due to lower Performance Shares outstanding during 2007 and higher expense acceleration during 2006, resulting from 12 payouts compared with six payouts in 2007. The decrease in 2006 Share-based plans expense is primarily due to the increase in our stock price during 2005 which resulted in additional compensation expense due to an increase in the number of performance shares meeting the price growth targets and being converted to common stock. The year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price. Other expense decreased in 2007 partly due to reduced intercompany profit elimination as a result of fewer intercompany deliveries during 2007 compared with 2006. 21 Table of Contents Other Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Earnings from operations $ 5,830 $ 3,014 $ 2,812 Other income, net 484 420 301 Interest and debt expense (196 ) (240 ) (294 ) Earnings before income taxes 6,118 3,194 2,819 Income tax expense (2,060 ) (988 ) (257 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $ 4,058 $ 2,206 $ 2,562 Other income, which primarily consists of interest income, was higher in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of increases in average principal balances and higher average rates of return on cash and investments. Other income was higher in 2006 compared with 2005 as a result of increases in average principal balances and higher average rates of return, partially offset by lower interest income compared with 2005 related to federal income tax settlements for prior years. Interest and debt expense decreased in 2007 and in 2006, primarily due to debt repayments. The effective income tax rate of 33.7% for 2007 differed from the 2006 effective income tax rate of 30.9% primarily due to Foreign Sales Corporation and Extraterritorial Income exclusion tax benefits that existed in 2006, but did not recur in 2007. This was partially offset by the non-deduction in 2006 of the global settlement with the U.S. DoJ and other income tax provision adjustments. The 2007 tax rate of 33.7% included enhanced Research and Development credits that exceeded the credits in 2006. The effective income tax rate of 30.9% for 2006 differed from the 2005 effective income tax rate of 9.1% primarily due to the favorable 2005 settlement with the Internal Revenue Service and the non-deduction in 2006 of the global settlement with the U.S. DoJ. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes see Note 4. Backlog Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. Contractual backlog increased by $80,397 million in 2007 compared to 2006 as a result of increases at Commercial Airplanes of $80,900 million, which were due to new orders in excess of deliveries for all programs offset by decreases at IDS of $503 million. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. Funding that is subsequently received is moved to contractual backlog. The decrease in IDS unobligated backlog of $3,502 million during 2007 compared with 2006 is primarily due to funding released from existing contracts on Future Combat Systems (FCS), Proprietary, C-17, P8-A and F-18, partially offset by increases in the F-22 program and Support Systems. 22 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment The fundamental drivers of air travel growth are a combination of economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Air traffic growth continues to exceed its long-term trend due to strong performance of these key drivers. Global economic growth, the primary driver of air traffic growth, remained above long-term trend for the fourth straight year in 2007. The world economy has grown at an average 3.8% annual rate since 2004 compared to the long-term trend rate of 3.1%. The increasingly diversified world economy is forecast to continue above-trend growth through the end of the decade although there is increased uncertainty in the near-term outlook due to a slowdown in the United States economy. Increasingly liberalized and competitive air travel markets are also supporting strong traffic growth. Many bilateral air service agreements governing air traffic rights between countries are liberalizing air travel around the world particularly in high growth markets such as China and India which have signed multiple new agreements over the last several years. In addition, open skies agreements, in which all traffic rights restrictions are eliminated, continue to emerge with United States – European Union open skies negotiations being the most prominent recent example. Airline ownership is also becoming more commercially driven – governments are reducing ownership and control stakes, moving away from national carriers. All of these facets of liberalization are increasing competition between airlines and further stimulating demand for air travel. In this increasingly liberalized environment, airlines are offering improved service levels increasing flight frequency and airport pairs served by 5% per year since 2004. The combination of these two fundamental drivers has led to a 9% annual average increase in the number of passengers since 2003. In addition, high fuel prices are spurring strong demand to replace older, less fuel efficient airplanes. Together, these two factors have led to strong demand for new aircraft – over 7,000 orders for large commercial jet aircraft over the last four years, increasing industry backlog levels to seven years of deliveries at current production rates. Fuel prices are also playing a key role in increasing the current demand for new aircraft. Strong economic growth has also led to sustained high oil and fuel prices. Between 2003 and 2007, jet fuel expense grew from 15 percent to more than 30 percent of airline operating costs. Airlines are responding by improving the fuel efficiency of their aircraft operations and reducing cost in many other areas. They are implementing more efficient (internet based) distribution systems, reducing commission payments, and drawing on their employees for participation in labor cost reduction. These initiatives, combined with strong demand, are enabling industry-wide profitability despite high fuel prices. Worldwide airlines achieved a $5.6 billion net profit in 2007 and are forecast to earn $5.0 billion in 2008. Looking forward, our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger traffic, and 6% per year for cargo traffic based on projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $2.8 trillion market for 28,600 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including disease outbreaks (such as avian flu), terrorism, global economic cycles, increased global environmental regulations and fuel prices. Fuel prices are forecast to remain elevated and volatile in the near-term due to strong demand driven by economic growth and historically low surplus capacity to cushion against supply shocks. 23 Table of Contents Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long-term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has continued to enable low-cost airlines to gain market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately two-thirds of Commercial Airplanes’ sales and contractual backlog are directly from customers based outside the United States. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China, and Japan are likely to enter the 70 to 130 seat aircraft market over the next few years. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. A decline of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies as experienced in 2007 puts pressure on competitors’ revenues and profits. Competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. Airbus has recently announced such initiatives targeting a two-year reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity by 2010. If the U.S. dollar strengthens, Airbus can use the extra efficiency to develop new products and gain market share. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively and maintain satisfactory margins. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 33,386 $ 28,465 $ 21,365 % of Total company revenues 50 % 46 % 40 % Earnings from operations $ 3,584 $ 2,733 $ 1,431 Operating margins 10.7 % 9.6 % 6.7 % Research and development $ 2,962 $ 2,390 $ 1,302 Contractual backlog $ 255,176 $ 174,276 $ 124,132 Revenues The increase in revenue of $4,921 million in 2007 from 2006 was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries, including model mix changes, of $3,369 million, increased commercial aviation support business of $1,432 million and $120 million primarily attributable to revenue from aircraft trading. 24 Table of Contents The increase in revenue of $7,100 million in 2006 from 2005 was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries, including model mix changes, of $6,820 million, increased commercial aviation support business of $873 million offset by $593 million primarily attributable to lower revenue from aircraft trading. In 2005 we delivered 29 fewer than expected airplanes due to the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) strike during the month of September 2005. This resulted in approximately $2,000 million lower revenue than anticipated for 2005. Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31, including deliveries under operating lease, which are identified by parentheses, were as follows: 717 737 NG 747 757 767 777 Total 2007 Cumulative Deliveries 155 2,466 1,396 1,049 959 687 Deliveries 330 * 16 12 * 83 441 2006 Cumulative Deliveries 155 2,136 1,380 1,049 947 604 Deliveries 5 (3) 302 * 14 12 * 65 398 2005 Cumulative Deliveries 150 1,834 1,366 1,049 935 539 Deliveries 13 (5) 212 * 13 2 10 * 40 290 * Intracompany deliveries were one 767 aircraft and one 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2007, two 767 aircraft and eight 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2006 and two 767 aircraft and two 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2005. Earnings from Operations The $851 million increase in earnings from operations in 2007 over the comparable period of 2006 was primarily attributable to earnings of $950 million on increased new aircraft deliveries and $304 million in increased earnings primarily attributable to commercial aviation support business. In addition cost performance improved by $169 million. These were offset by an increase in research and development costs of $572 million. The $1,302 million increase in earnings from operations in 2006 over the comparable period of 2005 was primarily attributable to earnings of $1,781 million on increased new aircraft deliveries and $315 million in increased earnings primarily attributable to commercial aviation support business. In addition cost performance improved by $226 million. Such items were offset by increased research and development costs of $1,088 million. In 2005 we had a loss on the sale of Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma operations of $68 million. The IAM strike resulted in lower operating earnings in 2005 due to 29 fewer than expected airplane deliveries. Backlog The backlog increase in 2007 related to orders in excess of deliveries for all programs, while the increase in 2006 related to orders in excess of deliveries for 737NG, 747 and 787. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. Its determination is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs of these contracts. It is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. 25 Table of Contents Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which do not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity decreases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also decreases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates, thus increasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The table below provides details as of December 31: Program 717 737 NG 747 757 767 777 787 2007 Program accounting quantities 156 3,800 1,474 1,050 998 950 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 2,076 125 52 357 817 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 155 4,542 1,521 1,049 1,011 1,044 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A N/A 2006 Program accounting quantities 156 3,200 1,449 1,050 985 900 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 1,560 116 28 299 448 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 155 3,696 1,496 1,049 975 903 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A 8 N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 1 % N/A 2005 Program accounting quantities 156 2,800 1,424 1,050 971 800 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 5 1,123 58 30 288 287 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 155 2,957 1,424 1,049 965 827 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A 3 N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 0 % N/A * The accounting quantity for the 787 program will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2009. 1 Firm orders represent new aircraft purchase agreements where the customers’ rights to cancel without penalty have expired. Typically customer rights to cancel without penalty include the customer receiving approval from its Board of Directors, shareholders, government and completing financing arrangements. All such cancellation rights must be satisfied or expired prior to recording a firm order even if satisfying such conditions are highly certain. Firm orders exclude option aircraft and aircraft with cancellation rights. 2 Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. 737 Next-Generation The accounting quantity for the 737 Next-Generation program increased by 600 units during 2007 due to the program’s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. 747 Program The accounting quantity for the 747 program increased by 25 units during 2007. In the fourth quarter of 2007 we completed firm configuration of the 747-8 Intercontinental airplane and during 2006 we completed firm configuration of the 747-8 Freighter. While there are always risks to development, production and certification schedules in the introduction of a new commercial derivative airplane, deliveries of the first 747-8 Freighter and Intercontinental airplane are targeted for late 2009 and late 2010. 26 Table of Contents 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 13 units during 2007. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2007 as a result of the program’s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. Firm configuration of the 777 Freighter was completed during 2006. Deliveries of the first 777 Freighter are targeted for late 2008. 787 Program We are in the very critical stages of final assembly and planning for flight test, and the risks that are always inherent in these latter stages of airplane production still remain. We continue to address challenges associated with assembly of the first airplanes, including start-up issues in our factory, management of our extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work and reconciliation of the airplane’s configuration with supplier and partner engineering. In January 2008 we announced that first flight of the 787 has been moved from the end of the first quarter of 2008 to around the end of the second quarter of 2008 to provide additional time to complete assembly of the first airplane. Deliveries are now expected to begin in early 2009, rather than late 2008. We continue working with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of the schedule change on the flight test program and entry into service. Fleet support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as commercial aviation support, these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. Research and development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Our Research and development expense increased $572 million and $1,088 million in 2007 and 2006. Research and development expense is net of development cost sharing payments received from suppliers. The increase in 2007 was due to higher spending of $542 million, primarily on 787 and 747-8, and $30 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments. We anticipate a decrease in research and development spending for 2008 primarily due to reduced 787 product development activities. 27 Table of Contents Integrated Defense Systems Business Environment and Trends IDS consists of three capabilities-driven businesses: Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems (PE&MS), Network and Space Systems (N&SS), and Support Systems. Defense Environment Overview The U.S. is faced with continuous force deployments overseas, stability operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and uncertainties about near-peer adversary states with growing sophistication and military means. At the same time, our defense department faces the simultaneous requirements to recapitalize important defense capabilities and to transform the force to take advantage of available technologies to meet the changing national security environment as outlined in the latest Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR). All of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant Federal budget deficits and bipartisan objectives to reduce and ultimately eliminate annual deficit spending as well as the upcoming 2008 Presidential elections. We anticipate that the national security environment will remain challenging for at least the next decade. Because U.S. DoD spending was about half of worldwide defense spending and represented approximately 84% of IDS revenue in 2007, the trends and drivers associated with the U.S. DoD budget are critical. The U.S. DoD budget has grown substantially over the past decade, particularly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Although the growth rate had moderated in recent years, the 2009 submittal equates to a 7.5% increase over 2008. The President’s request for fiscal year 2009 is $515 billion, excluding the additional initial request of $70 billion to continue the fight in the Global War on Terror (GWOT). The Procurement account continues to see growth with a request of $104 billion, a 5% increase over 2008, while the Research, Development, Test & Evaluation account increased modestly to $80 billion, a 4% increase from the 2008 level. (All projections and percentage increases are made without taking inflation into account and without accounting for Supplemental funding.) Over the past years, emergency supplemental requests have been used to cover the on-going costs of the GWOT. In addition to the fiscal year 2008 discretionary budget request, the President also submitted supplemental requests totaling $189 billion to cover operations in the GWOT. It is anticipated that additional supplemental requests for 2009 will exceed $100 billion, including the $70 billion initially requested, and that the trend to use supplemental requests to fund the GWOT will continue. Even though we continue to see modest growth in the U.S. DoD budget, it is unlikely that the U.S. DoD will be able to fully fund the hardware programs already in development as well as new initiatives in order to address the capability gaps identified in the latest QDR. This imbalance between future costs of hardware programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the U.S. DoD and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules, restructuring programs, and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding and occasionally by cancellation of programs. We expect the U.S. DoD will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies that emphasize jointness and network-enabled operations. These strategies will be enabled through persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, long-range strike, special operations, unmanned systems, precision guided kinetic and non-kinetic weapons as well as continued privatization of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. Consolidation of contractor-provided U.S. government launch capabilities was completed with the formation of the ULA joint venture in 2006. This consolidation was driven by the limited schedule of government launches as well as the downturn in the commercial launch market. Launch contractors had built business cases around the government market being supplemented by a robust commercial market, but as the commercial market declined these business cases were re-evaluated. The U.S. government has an assured access to space policy which requires that two separate vehicles be available for use. The ULA joint venture is intended to provide this assurance. 28 Table of Contents Civil Space Transportation and Exploration Environment NASA has had stable but very little growth in their funding in this decade. NASA’s fiscal year 2007 appropriation of $16.6 billion was approximately equal to the fiscal year 2006 funding level. NASA’s budget remains focused on needed funds for Space Shuttle Operations, International Space Station, and new initiatives associated with the Vision for Space Exploration. We anticipate funding levels to remain in the $17-$18 billion range in the near future. NASA is continuing to pursue elements of the Vision for Space Exploration, which will provide additional opportunities. Commercial Satellite Environment The commercial satellite market has strengthened since the downturn earlier in the decade and is expected to stabilize with replacement demand through the end of the decade. The market remains extremely competitive with overcapacity across the overall industry and strong pressure on pricing. We will continue to pursue profitable commercial satellite opportunities where the customer values our technical expertise and unique solutions. Integrated Defense Systems Operating Results IDS Realignment Effective January 1, 2007, the B-1 bomber program (formerly included in PE&MS) and certain Boeing Australia Limited programs (formerly included in N&SS) are included in Support Systems. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. See Note 22. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 32,080 $ 32,439 $ 31,106 % of Total company revenues 48 % 53 % 58 % Earnings from operations $ 3,440 $ 3,032 $ 3,919 Operating margins 10.7 % 9.3 % 12.6 % Research and development $ 851 $ 791 $ 855 Contractual backlog $ 41,788 $ 42,291 $ 36,505 Unobligated backlog $ 29,922 $ 33,424 $ 44,008 Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Revenues IDS revenues decreased 1% in 2007 primarily due the exclusion of the government Delta volume from N&SS revenues, now a revenue component for our joint venture ULA. Decreased revenue from this exclusion and lower revenues in the PE&MS segment were partially offset by increased volume in other N&SS programs and growth in the Support Systems segment. IDS revenues increased 4% in 2006 as growth in PE&MS and Support Systems was partially offset by lower volume in N&SS. Operating Earnings IDS operating earnings increased by $408 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to $770 million of charges on the AEW&C development program in 2006. The 2007 increase was partially offset by lower earnings in the PE&MS and N&SS segments. Operating earnings 29 Table of Contents decreased by $887 million in 2006 compared with 2005 reflecting a $569 million net gain on the sale of Rocketdyne in 2005 and $770 million of charges on the AEW&C development program in 2006 partially offset by improved margins on other programs. Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. IDS total backlog decreased 5% in 2007, from $75,715 million to $71,710 million, primarily due to current year deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years with the largest decreases in FCS, C-17, and P-8A programs. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished. Examples of these programs include Airborne Laser, E/A-18G, Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (JTRS), FCS, Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Joint Tactical Radio System, P-8A and Proprietary programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed, which could trigger termination-for-default provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of these programs include AEW&C, international KC-767 Tanker, commercial and military satellites, SBInet, Vigilare and High Frequency Modernisation. Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 13,685 $ 14,107 $ 13,308 % of Total company revenues 21 % 23 % 25 % Earnings from operations $ 1,629 $ 1,208 $ 1,720 Operating margins 11.9 % 8.6 % 12.9 % Research and development $ 447 $ 392 $ 432 Contractual backlog $ 22,957 $ 24,739 $ 21,630 Unobligated backlog $ 8,564 $ 8,962 $ 15,054 Revenues PE&MS revenues decreased 3% in 2007 compared with an increase of 6% in 2006. The decrease of $422 million in 2007 was due to reduced deliveries of the Apache and T-45 aircraft and Joint Direct Attack Munitions, partially offset by higher deliveries of Chinook and F-18 aircraft and higher volume on the P-8A program. The revenue growth of $799 million in 2006 was driven by higher deliveries of F-15 and Apache aircraft and higher volume on P-8A, F-22, and Chinook, partially offset by reduced revenues on AEW&C. 30 Table of Contents Deliveries of new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 F/A-18 Models 44 42 42 T-45TS Goshawk 9 13 10 F-15E Eagle 12 12 6 C-17 Globemaster 16 16 16 CH-47 Chinook 10 2 AH-64 Apache 17 31 12 C-40A Clipper 3 1 2 Total New-Build Production Aircraft 111 117 88 Operating Earnings PE&MS operating earnings increased by $421 million in 2007 primarily due to the 2006 charges of $770 million on the AEW&C development program, which were partially offset by lower 2007 earnings due to revised cost estimates on the international KC-767 Tanker program, lower prices on the C-17 program and revised cost and revenue estimates on the AEW&C program. Operating earnings decreased by $512 million in 2006 due to the above mentioned AEW&C charge, which was partially offset by earnings from revenue growth, favorable contract mix, and reduced Company-Sponsored Research & Development expenditures on the 767 Tanker program. Research and Development The PE&MS segment continues to focus its research and development resources where it can use its customer knowledge, technical strength and large-scale integration capabilities to provide innovative solutions to meet the war fighter’s enduring needs. Research and development has remained consistent over the past several years. Research and development activities leverage our capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to enhance our customers’ capabilities in the areas of mobility, precision effects, situational awareness and survivability. These efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness and interoperability, and improving affordability, reliability and economic ownership. Continued research and development investments in unmanned technology and systems have enabled the demonstration of multi-vehicle coordinated flight and distributed control of high-performance unmanned combat air vehicles. Research and development in advanced weapons technologies emphasizes, among other things, precision guidance and multi-mode targeting. Research and development investments in the Global Tanker Aircraft program represent a significant opportunity to provide state-of-the-art refueling capabilities to domestic and non-U.S. customers. Investments were also made to support various intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance business opportunities including P-8A and AEW&C aircraft. Other research and development efforts include upgrade and technology insertions to network-enable and enhance the capability and competitiveness of current product lines such as the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15E Eagle, AH-64 Apache, CH-47 Chinook and C-17 Globemaster. Backlog PE&MS total backlog decreased by 6% in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to deliveries and sales on C-17, F/A-18, P-8A and F-15. These decreases were partially offset by a multi-year contract for F-22 aircraft and international orders for AEW&C and F/A-18 aircraft. Total backlog decreased by 8% in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to deliveries and sales on F/A-18 and F-15 from multi-year contracts awarded in prior years. 31 Table of Contents Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on PE&MS operations include the following: AEW&C During 2006 we recorded charges of $770 million on our international Airborne Early Warning & Control program. This development program, also known as Wedgetail in Australia and Peace Eagle in Turkey, consists of a 737-700 aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems, some of which have never been installed on an airplane before. Wedgetail includes six aircraft and Peace Eagle includes four aircraft. This is an advanced and complex fixed-price development program involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability. We believe that the cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate; however, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed. International KC-767 Tanker Program During 2007, the PE&MS segment recorded charges of $152 million which were partially offset at the consolidated level. Currently the international KC-767 Tanker program includes four aircraft for the Italian Air Force and four aircraft for the Japanese Air Self Defense Force. These charges are associated with additional estimated costs for mitigating both the risks on the flight test program and the delivery risk associated with the Italy and Japan contracts. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion and development costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be missed. C-17 As of December 31, 2007 we delivered 171 of the 190 C-17 aircraft ordered by the U.S. Air Force, with final deliveries scheduled for 2009. In June 2007, based upon continued bipartisan congressional support, including the House Armed Services Committee addition of $2.4 billion for 10 C-17s in their mark of the 2008 budget, and U.S. Air Force testimony to Congress reflecting interest in additional C-17 aircraft, we directed key suppliers to begin work on 10 aircraft beyond the 190 currently on order. As of December 31, 2007, inventory expenditures and potential termination liabilities to suppliers for work performed related to anticipated orders for 10 C-17 aircraft to the U.S. Air Force and anticipated international orders for 3 additional aircraft totaled approximately $215 million. It is reasonably possible that we will decide in 2008 to complete production of the C-17 if further orders are not received. We are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shut-down, including any recovery that would be available from the government. Such recovery from the government would not include the costs incurred by us resulting from the second-quarter direction to key suppliers to begin working on the additional 10 aircraft. Network and Space Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 11,696 $ 11,941 $ 12,221 % of Total company revenues 18 % 19 % 23 % Earnings from operations $ 891 $ 952 $ 1,395 Operating margins 7.6 % 8.0 % 11.4 % Research and development $ 300 $ 301 $ 334 Contractual backlog $ 9,167 $ 7,838 $ 6,324 Unobligated backlog $ 20,210 $ 23,723 $ 27,634 32 Table of Contents Revenues N&SS revenues decreased 2% in both 2007 and 2006. The decrease of $245 million in 2007 was primarily due to the exclusion of government Delta volume, now a component of our equity investment in ULA and lower FCS volume, partially offset by increased volume on SBInet and several satellite programs. The decrease of $280 million in 2006 was primarily due to lower volume in Proprietary and GMD as well as the divestiture of our Rocketdyne business, which were partly offset by significant growth in FCS and higher Delta IV volume. Additional impacts resulted from fewer milestone completions in our commercial satellite business in 2006 and the completion of a Homeland Security contract in 2005. Delta launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Delta II Commercial 3 Delta II Government 2 2 Delta IV Government 3 Satellites 4 4 3 Delta government launches are excluded from our deliveries after December 1, 2006 due to the formation of ULA. Operating Earnings N&SS operating earnings decreased by $61 million in 2007 and decreased by $443 million in 2006. The decrease in 2007 was due to lower earnings on FCS and several satellite programs. These decreases were partially offset by higher award fees on GMD and a $44 million gain on sale of Anaheim property. The decrease in 2006 was primarily due to the $569 million net gain on the Rocketdyne sale and higher contract values for Delta IV launch contracts in 2005, partially offset by increased earnings in the FCS program in 2006. N&SS operating earnings include equity earnings of $85 million, $71 million and $72 million from the United Space Alliance joint venture in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively and equity loss of $11 million and equity earnings of $5 million from the ULA joint venture in 2007 and 2006. The ULA equity earnings and loss amounts are net of the basis difference amortization. Divestitures On February 28, 2005, we completed the stock sale of Electronic Dynamic Devices Inc. to L-3 Communications. On August 2, 2005 we completed the sale of our Rocketdyne business to United Technologies Corporation. See Note 7 Exit Activity and Divestitures. Research and Development The N&SS research and development funding remains focused on the development of intelligence and surveillance systems; communications and command and control capabilities that support a network-enabled architecture approach for our various government customers. We are investing in the communications market to enable connectivity between existing air/ground platforms, increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and leverage innovative communications concepts. Key programs in this area include Joint Tactical Radio System, FCS, Global Positioning System, and Transformational Satellite Communications System. Investments were also made to support concepts that will lead to the development of next-generation space intelligence systems. Along with increased funding to support these areas of architecture and network-enabled capabilities development, we also maintained our investment levels in global missile defense and advanced missile defense concepts and technologies. Backlog N&SS total backlog decreased by 7% in 2007 compared with 2006 due to revenues recognized on multi-year orders received in prior years on FCS and Proprietary programs, partially offset by an increase in our Space Exploration programs. Total backlog decreased by 7% in 2006 compared with 2005 primarily due to revenues recognized on multi-year orders received in prior years on the FCS program. 33 Table of Contents Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on N&SS operations include the following: United Launch Alliance On December 1, 2006, we completed the transaction with Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) to create a 50/50 joint venture named United Launch Alliance L.L.C. (ULA). ULA combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Atlas rockets. In connection with the transaction, we initially contributed net assets of $914 million at December 1, 2006. On July 24, 2007 we and Lockheed reached agreement with respect to resolution of the final working capital and the value of the launch vehicle support contracts that each party contributed to form ULA. Effective August 15, 2007 the parties received all necessary approvals pursuant to the terms of the Consent Order and the terms of the agreement which resulted in additional contributions from both parties with Boeing agreeing to contribute an additional $97 million which did not result in a cash outflow as it will be offset against future payments due to us from ULA associated with an inventory supply agreement. Additionally, conformed accounting adjustments made by ULA resulted in adjustments to ULA’s balance sheet. The book value of our investment exceeds our proportionate share of ULA’s net assets. This difference will be expensed ratably in future years. Based on the adjusted contributions and the conformed accounting policies established by ULA, this amortization is expected to be approximately $14 million annually for the next 17 years. In connection with the formation of ULA, we and Lockheed each committed to provide up to $25 million in additional capital contributions and we each have agreed to extend a line of credit to ULA of up to $200 million to support its working capital requirements. We and Lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain U.S. government contracts to ULA as of the closing date. We and Lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the U.S. government. In December 2006, we agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability of $1,375 million of Boeing Delta inventories included in contributed assets plus $1,860 million of inventory subject to the inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA sold $443 million of inventories that were contributed by us. During 2007, ULA determined that certain Delta II inventory is not fully recoverable. As a result we recorded charges of $31 million for non-recoverable Delta II inventory and $39 million for our share of the loss recorded by ULA related to Delta II. Future decisions regarding the Delta II program could reduce our earnings by up to $100 million. We also agreed to indemnify ULA in the event ULA is unable to obtain re-pricing of certain contracts which we contributed to ULA and to which we believe ULA is entitled. We will be responsible for any shortfall and may record up to $332 million in pre-tax losses related to these contracts. Sea Launch The Sea Launch venture, in which we are a 40% partner, provides ocean-based launch services to commercial satellite customers. 34 Table of Contents We have issued credit guarantees to creditors of the Sea Launch venture to assist it in obtaining financing. In the event we are required to perform on these guarantees, we believe we can recover a portion of the cost (estimated at $486 million) through guarantees from the other venture partners. The components of this exposure are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) EstimatedMaximumExposure EstablishedReserves EstimatedProceedsfromRecourse EstimatedNetExposure Credit guarantees $ 457 $ 183 $ 274 Partner Loans (principal and interest) 479 287 192 Trade receivable from Sea Launch 337 334 3 Performance guarantees 33 20 13 Subcontract termination 8 8 Other receivables and Inventory 47 39 8 $ 1,361 $ 843 $ 486 $ 32 We made no additional capital contributions to the Sea Launch venture during the year ended December 31, 2007. The venture conducted zero, five and four successful launches for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. A Sea Launch Zenit-3SL vehicle, carrying a Boeing-built NSS-8 satellite, experienced an anomaly during launch on January 30, 2007. The launch platform has been repaired and resumed flight operations on January 15, 2008, successfully launching a Boeing-built satellite. The venture incurred losses in 2007 due to a delay in its 2007 launch manifest that was caused by the launch anomaly and unusually strong ocean currents at the launch site during November and December. The venture incurred losses in 2006 and 2005 due to the relatively low price and volume of launches, driven by a depressed commercial satellite market and oversupply of launch vehicles as well as a high level of debt and debt servicing requirements. We suspended recording equity losses after writing our investment in and direct loans to Sea Launch down to zero in 2001 and accruing our obligation for third-party guarantees on Sea Launch indebtedness. We are not obligated to provide any further financial support to the Sea Launch venture. However, in the event that we do extend additional financial support to Sea Launch in the future, we will recognize suspended losses as appropriate. In addition, we continue to look at alternative capital structures for the venture. Satellites The Boeing-built NSS-8 satellite was declared a total loss due to an anomaly during launch on January 30, 2007. The NSS-8 satellite was insured for $200 million which was collected during the second and third quarter of 2007. New Skies Satellites B.V. (New Skies) declined to exercise its option to purchase a replacement spacecraft due to its assertion that we anticipatorily breached the contract. We believe that had New Skies exercised its option, we would have fulfilled our contractual responsibilities. We do not expect New Skies’ assertion to materially impact our consolidated results of operations, financial position, or cash flows. See the discussions of Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. (BSSI) litigation/arbitration with ICO Global Communications (Operations), Ltd., Thuraya Satellite Telecommunications, Telesat Canada, and Space Communications Corporation in Note 21. 35 Table of Contents Support Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 6,699 $ 6,391 $ 5,577 % of Total company revenues 10 % 10 % 10 % Earnings from operations $ 920 $ 872 $ 804 Operating margins 13.7 % 13.6 % 14.4 % Research and development $ 104 $ 98 $ 89 Contractual backlog $ 9,664 $ 9,714 $ 8,551 Unobligated backlog $ 1,148 $ 739 $ 1,320 Revenues Support Systems revenues increased $308 million in 2007 and $814 million in 2006, an increase of 5% and 15%. The increases were due to higher Integrated Logistics (IL) program volume resulting from the 2006 acquisition of Aviall, Inc. (Aviall) and increased revenue on the C-17 support program. Higher international program volume in 2007 was the result of our increased ownership in Alsalam Aircraft Company (Alsalam) which occurred during the second quarter of 2006. Lower volume on several Maintenance, Modification and Upgrades (MM&U) and Training Systems and Services (TS&S) programs partially offset the 2007 increases. Higher volume on several MM&U programs also contributed to the significant growth in 2006 revenues. In the second quarter of 2006 we increased our ownership interest in Alsalam, which operates as a Maintenance, Repair and Overhaul facility for various military and commercial aircraft. As a result, we began consolidating Alsalam’s financial statements, which generated revenues of $207 million during 2007 and $137 million during the last three quarters of 2006. Operating Earnings Support Systems operating earnings increased by 5% in 2007 and increased by 9% in 2006 driven by the revenue increases mentioned above in addition to a different contract mix. Research and Development Support Systems continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including IL, MM&U, TS&S and Advanced Logistics Support Systems, as well as on moving into the innovative Network Centric Logistics areas. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative and disciplined tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Examples of successful programs stemming from these investment strategies include the C-17 Globemaster Sustainment Partnership, the F/A-18 Integrated Readiness Support Teaming program, and the F-15 Singapore Performance Based Logistics contract. Backlog Support Systems total backlog increased by 3% in 2007 compared with 2006 due to increases in TS&S programs and International Support programs which were partially offset by decreases in MM&U and IL programs. Total backlog increased by 6% in 2006 compared with 2005 driven by a large IL order for Chinook support. Boeing Capital Corporation Segment Business Environment and Trends BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2007 totaled $6,532 million, which was substantially collateralized by Boeing produced commercial aircraft. While worldwide traffic levels are well above those in the past, the effects of higher fuel prices continue to impact the airline industry. At the same time, the credit ratings of some airlines, particularly in the United States, have remained at low levels. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is concentrated among U.S. commercial airline customers. 36 Table of Contents Certain aircraft models in BCC’s portfolio have recently experienced a lower rate of decline in market value and some models have experienced increases in market value. This market value condition had been due to certain positive factors including passenger load at record high levels, a limited supply of economically viable used aircraft, increasing lease rates, and increased demand from used aircraft buyers. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 1,600 commercial jet aircraft (8.2% of current world fleet) continue to be parked, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types, of which over 60% are not expected to return to service. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenues $ 815 $ 1,025 $ 966 Earnings from operations $ 234 $ 291 $ 232 Operating margins 29 % 28 % 24 % Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes. BCC’s revenues decreased $210 million in 2007, resulting from lower interest income on notes receivable of $75 million, lower investment income of $50 million primarily due to the sale or repayment at maturity of certain investments in 2006 and lower net gain on disposal of assets of $47 million. BCC’s revenues increased $59 million in 2006, primarily due to an increase of investment income and higher gain on the sale of aircraft and certain investments in notes receivable. Operating earnings BCC’s operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings decreased by $57 million in 2007 primarily due to lower revenues partially offset by lower interest expense, lower asset impairment expense and lower depreciation expense and a recovery of losses. The increase in operating earnings in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to higher revenues. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC: (Dollars in millions) 2007 2006 BCC Customer Financing and Investment Portfolio $ 6,532 $ 8,034 Valuation Allowance as a % of Total Receivables 2.5 % 2.4 % Debt $ 4,327 $ 5,590 Debt-to-Equity Ratio 5.0-to-1 5.0-to-1 BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2007 decreased from December 31, 2006 due to prepayment of certain notes receivable, normal portfolio run-off and sale of certain portfolio assets. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, BCC had $86 million and $259 million of 37 Table of Contents assets that were held for sale or re-lease of which $86 million and $253 million had firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $292 million are scheduled to be returned off lease in the next 12 months. These aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and $132 million were committed at December 31, 2007. BCC enters into certain transactions with the Other segment in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies. Finance Restructurings From time to time, certain BCC customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. As of December 31, 2007, BCC has not reached agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. Other Segment Other segment operating losses were $243 million during 2007 as compared to losses of $738 million in 2006. The reduction of $495 million was primarily due to the absence of losses related to Connexion by Boeing, which we exited in 2006. As part of our exit from this business, we recognized a charge of $320 million in 2006, in addition to losses of $237 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. We have not reached final settlements with all customers or suppliers. We do not believe the final settlements will have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. Other segment operating losses were $738 million during 2006 as compared to losses of $363 million in 2005. The increase of $375 million was primarily due to the $320 million charge from the exit of the Connexion by Boeing business and the $68 million environmental expense recognized in 2006. The Other segment recorded $74 million of lower valuation allowances for customer financing in 2006 compared to 2005. Additionally, during 2005, the Other segment recognized earnings of $63 million associated with the buyout of several operating lease aircraft by a customer. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net earnings $ 4,074 $ 2,215 $ 2,572 Non-cash items 2,835 3,097 3,494 Changes in working capital 2,675 2,187 934 Net cash provided by operating activities 9,584 7,499 7,000 Net cash used by investing activities (3,822 ) (3,186 ) (98 ) Net cash used by financing activities (4,884 ) (3,645 ) (4,657 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 46 38 (37 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents 924 706 2,208 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 6,118 5,412 3,204 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 7,042 $ 6,118 $ 5,412 Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $2,085 million to $9,584 million in 2007, primarily due to an increase in Net earnings. In addition, working capital improved in 2007, reflecting higher advances driven by commercial airplane orders and decreases in customer financing assets due to pre-payment of certain notes receivable and normal portfolio run-off, which were partially offset by an increase in inventories driven by the continued ramp-up of the 787 program. 38 Table of Contents Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $499 million to $7,499 million in 2006. The increase was primarily due to working capital improvements which were partially offset by lower Net earnings. The working capital improvements in 2006 compared with 2005 reflect $1,340 million of lower pension contributions in 2006. Working capital reductions in 2006 also reflect higher advances driven by commercial airplane orders, decreased investment in customer financing, and lower income tax payments which were partially offset by a decrease in accounts payable and other liability. Investing activities Cash used for investing activities increased to $3,822 million in 2007 from $3,186 million in 2006, largely due to increases in short-term investments, primarily time deposits and commercial paper, partially offset by our investment in the acquisition of Aviall in 2006. At December 31, 2007 the recorded balances of time deposits and commercial paper classified as short-term investments were $1,025 million and $799 million. As of December 31, 2007, our externally managed portfolio of investment grade fixed income instruments had an average duration of 1.5 years. The balance, at December 31, 2007 and 2006, was $3,269 million and $3,180 million, of which $306 million and $257 million was classified as short-term. The investments are held as available for sale. Cash used for investing activities increased to $3,186 million in 2006 from $98 million in 2005. The increase is primarily due to our investment of $1,738 million in the 2006 acquisition of Aviall, net of $42 million of cash acquired, and $458 million of assumed debt, in an all-cash merger. The assumed debt was repaid on the acquisition closing date. In 2005, we received proceeds of $1,676 million, primarily from the disposition of our Commercial Airplanes operations in Wichita, Kansas and Tulsa and McAlester, Oklahoma, and the sale of Rocketdyne. Financing activities Cash used by financing activities increased to $4,884 million in 2007 from $3,645 million in 2006 primarily due to increased common share repurchases. Cash used by financing activities decreased to $3,645 million in 2006 from $4,657 million in 2005 primarily due to lower common share repurchases. During 2007, we repurchased 28,995,599 shares at an average price of $95.68 in our open market share repurchase program and 28,432 shares in stock swaps. During 2006, we repurchased 21,184,202 shares at an average price of $80.18 in our open market share repurchase program, 3,749,377 shares at an average price of $80.28 as part of the ShareValue Trust distribution, and 49,288 shares in stock swaps. During 2005, we repurchased 45,217,300 shares at an average price of $63.60 in our open market share repurchase program and 33,660 shares in stock swaps. In 2007, we repaid $1,406 million of debt, including $1,309 million of debt held at BCC. In 2006, we repaid $1,681 million of debt, including $713 million of debt held at BCC and $458 million of debt assumed in the Aviall acquisition. In 2005, we repaid $1,378 million of debt. There were no debt issuances during 2007, 2006, or 2005. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the recorded balance of debt was $8,217 million and $9,538 million, of which $4,327 million and $5,590 million was recorded at BCC. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings are summarized below: Fitch Moody’s Standard &Poor’s Long-term: Boeing/BCC A+ A2 A+ Short-term: Boeing/BCC F1 P-1 A-1 39 Table of Contents On September 12, 2007, Fitch Ratings revised its ratings outlook to positive from stable, citing continuation of strong orders and production ramp up of large commercial aircraft, in addition to an over-funded status of our pension plans, debt reduction and stronger than expected cash flows. The ratings were reaffirmed at A+ for long-term borrowings and F1 for short-term borrowings. On January 16, 2008, Fitch Ratings changed their outlook on the A+ rating to stable from positive, citing the impact of delays in the 787 program. Capital Resources We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2007 and at December 31, 2007, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. We believe we have substantial borrowing capacity. Currently, we have $3,000 million ($1,500 million exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements. In 2007, we renewed the 364-day revolving credit facility and the 5-year credit facility, of which $500 million and $1,000 million is allocated to BCC. BCC has an aggregate of $3,421 million available for issuance from shelf registrations filed with the SEC, which are due to expire in November 2008. We believe our internally generated liquidity, together with access to external capital resources, will be sufficient to satisfy existing commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. We and Lockheed have agreed to make available to ULA a line of credit in the amount of up to $200 million each as may be necessary from time to time to support ULA’s Expendable Launch Vehicle business during the five year period following December 1, 2006. ULA did not request any funds under the line of credit as of December 31, 2007. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158), we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, with a corresponding after-tax adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The 2007 annual remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement plans resulted in a net $3,441 million increase in Shareholders’ equity. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. 40 Table of Contents Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2007, and the estimated timing thereof. Contractual obligations (Dollars in millions) Total Less than1 year 1–3years 3–5years After 5years Long-term debt (including current portion) $ 8,114 $ 746 $ 1,197 $ 2,090 $ 4,081 Interest on debt* 5,607 507 910 684 3,506 Pension and other post retirement cash requirements 7,403 675 1,441 1,549 3,738 Capital lease obligations 103 19 22 22 40 Operating lease obligations 1,086 221 297 158 410 Purchase obligations not recorded on statement of financial position 104,023 37,922 40,785 18,281 7,035 Purchase obligations recorded on statement of financial position 10,827 9,829 598 396 4 Total contractual obligations $ 137,163 $ 49,919 $ 45,250 $ 23,180 $ 18,814 * Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2007. Variable rate debt was approximately 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2007. Income tax obligations As of December 31, 2007, our total liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $1,374 million, of which $253 million we expect to pay in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $1,121 million. Our income tax obligations are excluded from the table above. See Note 4. Pension and other postretirement benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to a single plan that is funded through a trust. Purchase obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, the agreements are not cancelable without substantial penalty. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the statements of financial position. Approximately 11% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement 41 Table of Contents through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Industrial participation agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2007, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2007, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $8.9 billion that extend through 2024. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a country outside the U.S. or customer must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable. Commercial commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2007. (Dollars in millions) Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $ 4,973 $ 4,585 $ 238 $ 1 $ 149 Aircraft financing commercial commitments 8,350 879 2,764 3,443 1,264 Total commercial commitments $ 13,323 $ 5,464 $ 3,002 $ 3,444 $ 1,413 Aircraft financing commercial commitments include commitments to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest funding dates. Based on historical experience, we currently do not anticipate that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers, see Note 13. Industrial Revenue Bonds We utilize Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) issued by the City of Wichita, Kansas and Fulton County, Georgia to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property, see Note 12. 42 Table of Contents Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Most significant legal proceedings are related to matters covered by our insurance. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 21, including our contesting the default termination of the A-12 aircraft, employment and benefits litigation brought by several of our employees, and litigation/arbitration involving BSSI programs. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $679 million at December 31, 2007. For additional information, see Note 13. Income Taxes We have recorded a net liability of $1,272 million at December 31, 2007 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of these contingencies, see Note 4. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contract’s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future 43 Table of Contents periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in IDS for all of 2007 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1.0%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $321 million. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured parts, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for all commercial airplane programs for all of 2007 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $278 million. Aircraft Valuation Impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease We evaluate assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease for impairment when the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset is less than its carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including our intentions for how long we will 44 Table of Contents hold an asset subject to operating lease before we sell the asset, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $6 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Used aircraft acquired by the Commercial Airplanes segment are included in Inventory at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. To mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. While on operating lease, the assets are included in ‘Customer financing’, however, the valuation continues to be based on the lower of cost or market. Allowance for losses on customer financing receivables The allowance for losses on receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Two of the major factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings and collateral values. If each customer’s credit rating were increased or decreased by one major rating category at December 31, 2007, the allowance would have decreased by $22 million or increased by $49 million. If the collateral values were 10% lower at December 31, 2007, the allowance would have increased by $27 million. Lease residual values Equipment under operating leases is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases. If the estimated residual values declined 5% at December 31, 2007, this would result in a future cumulative pre-tax earnings impact of $105 million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods, of which $10 million would be recognized in 2008. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairments Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment annually, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. Our annual testing date is April 1. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. 45 Table of Contents The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded. At the date of our previous impairment test, a 10% increase or decrease in the value of our common stock would have had no impact on the financial statements. Indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would result in an impairment charge of approximately $11 million. Postretirement plans We have defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all our employees. We also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements require several assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Changes in assumptions can significantly affect our future annual expense. In addition, as result of our adoption of SFAS 158, differences between actual and expected returns on assets, changes in assumptions, and changes in plan provisions could significantly increase or decrease Shareholders’ Equity (net of taxes) at future measurement dates. We use a discount rate that is based on a point-in-time estimate as of our September 30 annual measurement date. Changes in the discount rate will increase or decrease our recorded liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to Shareholders’ Equity as of the measurement date. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate. As of September 30, 2007 (in millions) Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bps Pension plans Dollars Dollars Projected benefit obligation (pensions) (1,263 ) 1,436 Net periodic pension cost (145 ) 155 Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (168 ) 185 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost (14 ) 13 Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2007 pension income by approximately $114 million. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long term rate of return are reflected in Shareholders’ Equity (net of taxes) as of our annual measurement date. 46 Table of Contents The assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following year’s expense recorded liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change. As of September 30, 2007 (in millions) Change in medical trend rateIncrease 100 bps Change in medical trend rateDecrease 100 bps Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 621 (545 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost 121 (109 ) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest rate risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally investments, fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to interest rate changes. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. The principal source of BCC’s market risk relates to interest rate changes. This risk is managed by matching the profile of BCC’s liabilities with the profile of BCC’s assets. Exposure to mismatched risk is measured and managed with the use of interest rate derivatives. We do not use interest rate derivatives for speculative or trading purposes. Although many of the assets, liabilities and derivatives affected by a change in interest rates are not traded, if we had an immediate, one-time, 100 basis-point increase in market rates at December 31, 2007, we estimate that the tax-adjusted net fair value of these items would have decreased by $12 million compared to a decrease of $9 million at December 31, 2006. Based on the portfolio of other Boeing existing debt, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material. The investors in the fixed-rate debt obligations that we issue do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign currency exchange rate risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2007, a 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have reduced our unrealized gains by $69 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. 47 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:34.138907
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and the second-largest defense contractor in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors located around the world. Our business strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes and Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services that open new frontiers in aerospace. We focus on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. IDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as commercial and defense markets often offset each others’ cyclicality. BCC delivers value through supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure. Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Commercial Airplanes $ 28,263 $ 33,386 $ 28,465 Integrated Defense Systems 32,047 32,052 32,411 Boeing Capital Corporation 703 815 1,025 Other 567 308 327 Unallocated items and eliminations (671 ) (174 ) (698 ) Revenues $ 60,909 $ 66,387 $ 61,530 The decrease in 2008 revenues of $5,478 million is primarily due to lower revenues at Commercial Airplanes. Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $5,123 million, primarily as a result of decreases in new airplane deliveries reflecting the effects of the labor strike, partially offset by higher intercompany revenues and higher pre-strike deliveries and model mix. We delivered 104 fewer than expected airplanes due to the IAM strike during 2008. This reduced revenue by approximately $6.4 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. IDS revenues were unchanged as revenue growth in Global Services and Support (GS&S) was offset by decreases in Boeing Military Airplanes (BMA) and Network and Space Systems (N&SS). BCC revenues decreased by $112 million primarily due to lower interest income on financing receivables and notes and a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Other segment revenues increased by $259 million primarily due to the sale of four C-17 aircraft during 2008, that were held under an operating lease. Unallocated items and eliminations changed by $497 million, primarily due to the intercompany elimination of P-8A Poseidon program (P-8A) revenues recognized by Commercial Airplanes. 20 Table of Contents Revenues in 2007 grew by $4,857 million, primarily due to the growth at Commercial Airplanes. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $4,921 million, primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries and increased commercial aviation support activities. IDS revenues decreased by $359 million, primarily due to lower revenues in N&SS resulting from the formation of the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture in 2006 and lower revenues in BMA, offset by growth in GS&S. BCC revenues decreased by $210 million primarily due to a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Unallocated items and eliminations changed by $524 million primarily due to fewer Commercial Airplanes intercompany deliveries when compared with 2006. Earnings from Operations The following table summarizes our earnings from operations: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Commercial Airplanes 1,186 $ 3,584 $ 2,733 Integrated Defense Systems 3,232 3,440 3,031 Boeing Capital Corporation 162 234 291 Other (307 ) (331 ) (813 ) Unallocated items and eliminations (323 ) (1,097 ) (1,657 ) Settlement with U.S. Department of Justice, net of accruals (571 ) Earnings from operations $ 3,950 $ 5,830 $ 3,014 Operating earnings in 2008 decreased by $1,880 million compared with 2007. Commercial Airplanes earnings decreased by $2,398 million compared with the same period in 2007, primarily due to fewer new airplane deliveries resulting from the strike, increased program infrastructure costs related to the strike and revised schedules on 787 and 747-8, and a charge taken on the 747-8 program. Commercial Airplanes’ research and development expense decreased by $124 million to $2,838 million compared with the same period in 2007, primarily due to lower spending on 787 partially offset by higher spending on 747-8 and lower supplier development cost sharing payments. IDS earnings decreased by $208 million compared with 2007 primarily due to lower earnings in the BMA segment resulting from a $248 million charge taken on the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C). BCC operating earnings decreased $72 million reflecting lower revenues and a provision for losses partially offset by lower interest expense. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2008 improved by $774 million compared with 2007, which is further explained in the table below. Operating earnings in 2007 improved by $2,816 million compared with 2006. The increase is partly due to the $571 million global settlement with U.S. Department of Justice (U.S. DoJ) that occurred in the second quarter of 2006. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $851 million compared with the same period in 2006, primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries, commercial aviation support activities and improved cost performance offset by increased research and development expense. Commercial Airplanes’ research and development expense increased by $572 million to $2,962 million compared with the same period 2006, primarily due to spending on the 787 and 747-8 programs. IDS earnings increased by $409 million compared with 2006. The increase is primarily due to 2006 charges of $770 million in the BMA segment related to AEW&C, partially offset by lower 2007 earnings on several programs in the BMA and N&SS segments. BCC operating earnings decreased $57 million reflecting lower revenues partially offset by a recovery of losses and lower expenses. Other segment earnings improved by $482 million primarily due to the absence of losses related to Connexion by Boeing, which included a charge of $320 million to exit this business in 2006. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2007 contributed $560 million to the 2007 earnings improvement, which is further explained in the table below. 21 Table of Contents The most significant items included in Unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Pension and other postretirement $ (287 ) $ (686 ) $ (472 ) Share-based plans (149 ) (233 ) (680 ) Deferred compensation benefit/(expense) 223 (51 ) (211 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations (110 ) (127 ) (294 ) Total $ (323 ) $ (1,097 ) $ (1,657 ) We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of $1,132 million, $1,773 million and $1,663 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period. Accordingly, earnings from operations included $1,203 million, $1,730 million and $1,227 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense. Unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP) in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. Pension and other postretirement expense decreased during 2008 when compared with 2007 primarily due to a decrease in overall pension costs compared to the same period in the prior year. Pension and other postretirement expense increased during 2007 when compared with 2006 primarily due to increased overall pension costs recognized in inventory as of December 31, 2006, which were subsequently expensed in cost of sales in 2007. The reduction in Share-based plans expense is primarily due to the expiration of certain Performance Shares during 2008 and higher expense acceleration during 2007, resulting from six payouts compared with zero payouts in 2008. The reduction in Share-based plans expense during 2007 is primarily due to lower Performance Shares outstanding in 2007 and higher expense acceleration during 2006, resulting from 12 payouts compared with six payouts in 2007. The year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions. Other unallocated items and expense includes a charge related to satellite litigation of $100 million, offset by lower performance-based compensation in 2008. Other unallocated items and expense in 2007 decreased as a result of reduced intercompany profit elimination as a result of fewer intercompany deliveries than the previous year. 22 Table of Contents Other Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Earnings from operations $ 3,950 $ 5,830 $ 3,014 Other income, net 247 484 420 Interest and debt expense (202 ) (196 ) (240 ) Earnings before income taxes 3,995 6,118 3,194 Income tax expense (1,341 ) (2,060 ) (988 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $ 2,654 $ 4,058 $ 2,206 Other income, which primarily consists of interest income, was lower in 2008 compared with 2007 as a result of lower interest rates and lower investment balances. Other income was higher in 2007 compared with 2006 as a result of increases in average principal balances and higher average rates of return on cash and investments. Interest and debt expense remained flat in 2008 but decreased in 2007 compared with 2006, primarily due to debt repayments. The effective income tax rates were 33.6% and 33.7% for 2008 and 2007. The effective income tax rate of 33.7% for 2007 differed from the 2006 effective income tax rate of 30.9% primarily due to Foreign Sales Corporation and Extraterritorial Income exclusion tax benefits that existed in 2006, but did not recur in 2007. This was partially offset by the non-deduction in 2006 of the global settlement with the U.S. DoJ and other income tax provision adjustments. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes see Note 4. Backlog Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. Contractual backlog increased by $26,896 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result of increases at Commercial Airplanes of $23,399 million, which were due to new orders in excess of deliveries for our 737NG, 767, 777 and 787 programs. IDS contractual backlog increased by $3,497 million in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to international orders for F-15 and C-17 aircraft. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The decrease in total Unobligated backlog during 2008 is primarily due to decreases at IDS of $2,174 million compared with 2007 primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts including the F/A-18, Future Combat Systems (FCS), and F-22 programs. These decreases were partially offset by multi-year procurement contracts awarded on the V-22 and Chinook programs. The decrease in total Unobligated backlog during 2007 is primarily due to decreases at IDS of $3,492 million compared with 2006 primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts on FCS, Proprietary, C-17, P-8A and F/A-18, partially offset by increases in the F-22 program and several GS&S programs. 23 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment For the world’s airlines, 2008 was a challenging year characterized by volatility of several key operational factors including oil prices, economic growth, exchange rates and financing terms. In the first half of the year, airlines focused on adapting to spiking oil prices which peaked close to $150/barrel in July. In the second half of 2008, the focus turned to the implications of the global credit crisis and recession as fuel prices fell below $40/barrel for the first time since 2004. Air traffic growth declined toward the end of the year as higher fares to cover higher fuel costs earlier in the year and the economic slowdown reduced demand for air travel. The impact to airline operations and profitability was dramatic. Globally, over 25 airlines entered bankruptcy, and airlines curtailed capacity growth by cutting unprofitable routes and flights, reducing utilization, and parking older generation airplanes. Following its first profitable year since 2000 in 2007, the airline industry fell back into losses in 2008 led by U.S. airlines. U.S. airlines were most exposed to the fuel price shock due to limited hedging and a weakening dollar, but as the demand environment deteriorated, airlines in all regions faced lower profit outlooks by the end of 2008. The near-term outlook is highly uncertain due to the volatility of key drivers such as economic growth and fuel prices. Near-term air traffic growth forecasts vary significantly but generally indicate minimal to negative growth in 2009. Early 2009 airline schedules show a 2%-3% decline in world capacity as airlines attempt to match capacity with air travel demand. Profitability forecasts for 2009 also range widely both at the global as well as regional levels. Airlines continue to cut non-fuel costs including distribution, labor and overhead but significant uncertainty remains around fuel prices and revenues. From time to time certain customers may request cancelations, modifications, or rescheduling of their existing orders to meet revised fleet plans. Whether such requests will result in a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flow or financial position depends on a number of factors including whether the request is granted, the type of aircraft, how much compensation is paid to us for costs already incurred and our ability to reschedule other orders to replace those canceled, modified, or rescheduled. The fundamental drivers of air travel growth are a combination of economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Beyond the near-term market uncertainties, our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger traffic, and 6% per year for cargo traffic based on projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $3.2 trillion market for 29,400 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including disease outbreaks (such as avian flu), terrorism, and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long-term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has continued to enable low-cost airlines to gain market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. 24 Table of Contents Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 10% of Commercial Airplanes’ contractual backlog in dollar terms is with U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China, and Japan are likely to enter the 70 to 150 seat aircraft market over the next few years. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. A decline of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies as experienced in 2007 puts pressure on competitors’ revenues and profits. Competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. Airbus has announced such initiatives targeting overhead cost savings, a reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity through 2012. If the U.S. dollar continues to strengthen, Airbus can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing, and/or improve earnings. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 28,263 $ 33,386 $ 28,465 % of Total company revenues 46 % 50 % 46 % Earnings from operations $ 1,186 $ 3,584 $ 2,733 Operating margins 4.2 % 10.7 % 9.6 % Research and development $ 2,838 $ 2,962 $ 2,390 Contractual backlog $ 278,575 $ 255,176 $ 174,276 Revenues Year over year changes in Revenue are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) 2008vs 2007 2007vs 2006 New airplane sales $ (4,876 ) $ 3,369 Aircraft trading (264 ) 120 Commercial aviation services business 17 1,432 Total $ (5,123 ) $ 4,921 25 Table of Contents The decrease in revenue of $5,123 million in 2008 from 2007 is primarily attributable to lower new airplane deliveries. The IAM strike resulted in 104 airplane deliveries moving out of 2008 which reduced 2008 revenues by $6,406 million. The strike impact was partially offset by higher intercompany revenues of $804 million, and higher pre-strike deliveries, net of model mix changes, of $726 million. Aircraft trading activity decreased by $264 million as a result of fewer sales of used aircraft. Revenues in commercial aviation services business increased by $17 million driven by increased spares and services revenue offset by decreased passenger to freighter conversions. The increase in revenue of $4,921 million in 2007 from 2006 is attributable to increased new airplane deliveries, including model mix changes, of $3,369 million, increased commercial aviation services business of $1,432 million and increased aircraft trading activity of $120 million. Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31, including deliveries under operating lease, which are identified by parentheses, were as follows: 717 737 NG 747 767 777 Total 2008 Cumulative Deliveries 155 2,756 1,410 969 748 Deliveries 290 * 14 10 * 61 375 2007 Cumulative Deliveries 155 2,466 1,396 959 687 Deliveries 330 * 16 12 * 83 441 2006 Cumulative Deliveries 155 2,136 1,380 947 604 Deliveries 5 (3) 302 * 14 12 * 65 398 * Intercompany deliveries were two 767 aircraft and two 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2008, one 767 aircraft and one 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2007 and two 767 aircraft and eight 737 Next Generation aircraft in 2006. Earnings from Operations Earnings from operations decreased by $2,398 million in 2008 when compared with 2007, a decrease in operating margins of 6.5 percentage points to 4.2%. Lower new airplane deliveries, partially offset by higher intercompany revenues, reduced earnings by $1,400 million. A charge for a reach-forward loss on the 747 program resulting from increases to estimated costs for development and production of 747-8 derivatives reduced 2008 earnings by $685 million. Infrastructure cost allocations related to the 787 and 747-8 schedule delays and infrastructure costs incurred during the IAM strike reduced earnings by $287 million. The 787 and 747-8 schedule delays resulted in production programs receiving larger allocations of current and future infrastructure costs and reduced margins on 2008 deliveries, while the program infrastructure costs incurred during the IAM strike decreased margins on airplanes delivered during the second half of the year. Increased period cost and other performance reduced earnings by $108 million. A reduction in commercial aviation services volume and mix-related earnings of $42 million was primarily due to a decrease in volume on passenger to freighter conversion programs. Lower research and development costs improved earnings by $124 million. Earnings from operations increased by $851 million in 2007 when compared with 2006, an increase in operating margins of 1.1 percentage points to 10.7%. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in new airplane deliveries of $950 million, improved cost performance of $169 million and commercial aviation services business increase of $304 million. These were offset by increased research and development costs of $572 million. 26 Table of Contents Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before Boeing and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. The backlog increase in 2008 related to orders in excess of deliveries for our 737NG, 767, 777 and 787 programs, while the increase in 2007 related to orders in excess of deliveries for all programs. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts and is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs of these contracts. It is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which do not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity decreases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also decreases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates, thus increasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. 27 Table of Contents The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The table below provides details as of December 31: Program 737 NG 747 767 777 787 2008 Program accounting quantities 4,200 1,499 1,023 1,050 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 2,270 114 70 350 910 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 5,026 1,524 1,039 1,098 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 2007 Program accounting quantities 3,800 1,474 998 950 * Undelivered units under firm orders 2,076 125 52 357 817 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 4,542 1,521 1,011 1,044 Anticipated orders N/A N/A N/A N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A N/A N/A 2006 Program accounting quantities 3,200 1,449 985 900 * Undelivered units under firm orders 1,560 116 28 299 448 Cumulative firm orders (CFO)2 3,696 1,496 975 903 Anticipated orders N/A N/A 8 N/A Anticipated orders as a % of CFO N/A N/A 1 % N/A * The accounting quantity for the 787 program will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2010. 1 Undelivered units are not adjusted for cancellations subsequent to December 31, 2008. 2 Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. 737 Next-Generation The accounting quantity for the 737 Next-Generation program increased by 400 units during 2008 due to the program’s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. 747 Program In November 2008, we announced a revised schedule for the delivery of the 747-8 Freighter and Intercontinental airplanes. Deliveries of the first 747-8 Freighter moved from the fourth quarter of 2009 into the third quarter of 2010. Delivery of the 747-8 Intercontinental moved from the fourth quarter of 2010 into the second quarter of 2011. The schedule change was caused by design changes, limited availability of engineering resources and the recent IAM strike. In the third quarter of 2008, we increased our cost estimates to incorporate the anticipated schedule delay and design changes and reduced margins on the 747 program to zero. We experienced further cost growth in the fourth quarter and recorded a charge of $685 million to recognize a reach-forward loss. The charge is primarily related to higher than anticipated costs due to late changes to wing design which drove new load requirements into the fuselage and created other statement of work changes for our suppliers. Design and load changes also reduced commonality with 747-400 and resulted in increased costs for components and systems. Higher pension costs, infrastructure cost shifts, delays in transitioning certain components to suppliers and higher internal production costs also increased cost estimates. We believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate; however, this remains a development program, with the associated inherent risks. 28 Table of Contents The accounting quantity for the 747 program increased by 25 units in 2008. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 25 units during 2008. On February 29, 2008, the U.S. Air Force announced it had chosen a competitor’s bid over our proposed 767 derivative to build 179 replacement tankers for the Air Force’s aging KC-135 fleet of air-to-air refueling tankers. On March 11, 2008, we filed a formal protest with the Government Accountability Office, citing irregularities with the process of the tanker competition and the evaluation of the competitors’ bids. On June 18, 2008, the Government Accountability Office sustained our protest of the contract award. On September 10, 2008, the Department of Defense notified the Congress and the two competing contractors, Boeing and Northrop Grumman, that it was terminating the current competition for a U.S. Air Force airborne tanker replacement. We anticipate that the tanker competition will re-open in 2009. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 100 units during 2008. Delivery of the first 777 Freighter is scheduled for early 2009. 787 Program We are in the final stages of assembly of the initial airplanes and planning for flight test. The risks that are always inherent in the latter stages of new airplane program production remain. We continue to address challenges associated with assembly of the first few airplanes, including management of our extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, weight and systems integration. We are also continuing efforts to satisfy customer mission and performance needs in light of the anticipated weight of their respective aircraft. During 2008, we announced schedule delays for the 787 airplane. First flight of the 787-8 airplane has moved from the second quarter of 2008 into the second quarter of 2009. Delivery of the first 787 moved from early 2009 into the first quarter of 2010. Delivery schedules for 787 derivative airplanes may also be impacted. The revised schedule reflects the cumulative impacts of disruption caused by the recent IAM strike, the requirement to replace certain fasteners in early production airplanes, as well as the impact from the challenges mentioned above. We continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes, including delivery delays and supplier assertions associated with such changes. A number of our customers have contractual remedies that may be implicated by our revised plan for the 787. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. Research and Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. 29 Table of Contents Our Research and development expense decreased $124 million in 2008. Research and development expense is net of development cost sharing payments received from suppliers. The decrease in research and development spending for 2008 was primarily due to reduced 787 product development activities partially offset by $278 million of increased spending on the 747-8 program and $80 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments. Our Research and development expense increased $572 million in 2007. The increase in 2007 was due to higher spending of $542 million, primarily on 787 and 747-8, and $30 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments. Additional Considerations In 2008, we recorded a reach-forward loss on the 747 program and announced additional delays and challenges on the 787 program that highlight the risks that are always inherent in new airplane programs and derivative airplanes. Costs related to development of new programs and derivative airplanes are generally expensed as incurred. Costs to produce new aircraft are included in inventory and accounted for using program accounting. Airplane programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated production costs exceed our estimated program revenues for the accounting quantity. Generally commercial airplanes are sold on a firm fixed-price basis with an indexed price escalation clause and are often sold several years before scheduled delivery. While firm fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. Many new airplanes and derivatives have highly complex designs and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price and result in higher period costs for research and development or reduce margins on future deliveries or in a material charge if the program has or is determined to have a reach-forward loss. Changes to estimates of the program accounting quantity, production costs and rates, learning curve and costs of derivatives could also result in lower margins or reach-forward losses. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Examples of such commercial development programs include the 787, 747-8 and 777 freighter. Integrated Defense Systems Business Environment and Trends IDS consists of three capabilities-driven businesses: Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA), Network and Space Systems (N&SS), and Global Services and Support (GS&S). Defense Environment Overview The U.S. is faced with the continuing struggle to balance funding priorities for current irregular threats while preparing for potential threats from near-peer states with growing sophistication and military means. The U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) faces the simultaneous requirements to recapitalize important defense capabilities and to transform the force to take advantage of available technologies to meet the changing national security environment as outlined in the latest National Defense Strategy. All of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant competing national priorities including dealing with the economic crisis. We anticipate that the national security environment will remain challenging well into the next decade. Policies of the new administration will impact the defense environment and will likely include a complete review of the defense budget in FY2010 and beyond, more emphasis on increasing diplomatic efforts to expand and strengthen our alliances, and reforms to the defense acquisition process. 30 Table of Contents Because U.S. DoD spending was about half of worldwide defense spending and represented approximately 80% of IDS revenue in 2008, the trends and drivers associated with the U.S. DoD budget are critical. Although the U.S. DoD budget has grown substantially over the past decade, we anticipate the growth rate to level off over the next several years. In addition to the fiscal year 2009 discretionary budget request of $515 billion, the President submitted supplemental requests totaling $70 billion. Procurement and Research and Development accounts continue to face increasing budgetary pressures due to growing requirements from Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and personnel costs tied to U.S. commitments overseas. However, this trend is partially offset by equipment recapitalization efforts and continued demand for systems development. Near-term forecast of the defense budget environment shows limited growth in the 2009 to 2010 period for investment efforts with greater concern existing for the period following U.S. troop draw-downs in Iraq. We continue to see pressure to significantly reduce emergency supplemental requests that have been used to cover the ongoing costs of the Global War on Terror. It is unlikely that the U.S. DoD will be able to fully fund all programs of record already in development as well as new initiatives. This imbalance between future costs of programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the U.S. DoD and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules, restructuring programs, and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding and occasionally by cancellation of programs. We expect the U.S. DoD will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies that emphasize utilization of off-the-shelf solutions and network-enabled operations. These strategies will be enabled through persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), long-range strike, special operations, unmanned systems, cyber security, precision-guided kinetic and non-kinetic weapons as well as continued outsourcing of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. While international defense markets have not demonstrated the dramatic increases experienced by the U.S. market in recent years they have reversed the declining trend seen in the 1990s. The procurement deferrals taken by international countries has resulted in growing demands for new equipment to address operational requirements, aging inventories, and changing threat environments. Asymmetric warfare remains a key challenge with many nations placing renewed emphasis on acquiring material that is deployable, survivable, and interoperable with the international community. Similar to the U.S., many European nations are facing pressures in their O&M and personnel budgets that are squeezing funding for investment. Middle Eastern markets continue to spend significant amounts on new equipment; however, the impact from volatile oil prices has the potential to affect willingness to commit extra budgetary resources. In Asia growth is continuing with multiple nations pursuing major new acquisitions to address growing regional threats. The international market will be affected by the global economic challenges; however, the continuing threat environment should keep the market stable in 2009. Federal Market Environment We continue to see growth in the needs of Federal customers particularly for the Intelligence community and the Department of Homeland Security. Areas such as cyber security, border protection, and infrastructure security have increased in importance in order to meet the needs of the national security environment. We also anticipate a continuation of the trend toward outsourcing federal and government services. Civil Space Transportation and Exploration Environment The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has had stable annual funding in this decade. NASA’s budget remains focused on needed funds for Space Shuttle Operations, International Space Station, and new initiatives associated with the Vision for Space Exploration. NASA is continuing to pursue elements of the Vision for Space Exploration, which will provide additional opportunities in launch activities and research and development. 31 Table of Contents Commercial Satellite Environment The commercial satellite market has strengthened since the downturn earlier in the decade and is expected to stabilize with replacement demand through the end of the decade. Despite improvement in market demand the industry continues to be characterized by overcapacity creating strong competitive pressures on pricing. Segment Name Changes In the third quarter of 2008, we changed the names of the Precision Engagement and Mobility Systems segment to Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) and the Support Systems segment to Global Services and Support (GS&S). IDS Realignment Effective January 1, 2008 and 2007, certain programs were realigned between IDS segments. In addition, certain environmental remediation contracts (formerly included in N&SS) were transferred to the Other Segment. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. See Note 21. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 32,047 $ 32,052 $ 32,411 % of Total company revenues 53 % 48 % 53 % Earnings from operations $ 3,232 $ 3,440 $ 3,031 Operating margins 10.1 % 10.7 % 9.4 % Research and development $ 933 $ 848 $ 786 Contractual backlog $ 45,285 $ 41,788 $ 42,287 Unobligated backlog $ 27,719 $ 29,893 $ 33,385 Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Revenues IDS revenues were unchanged in 2008 as revenue growth in GS&S was offset by decreases in BMA and N&SS. IDS revenues decreased by 1% in 2007 primarily due to the exclusion of the government Delta volume from N&SS revenues, now a revenue component for our joint venture ULA. Decreased revenue from this exclusion and lower revenues in the BMA segment were partially offset by increased volume in other N&SS programs and growth in the GS&S segment. Operating Earnings IDS earnings, which include the effects of the IAM strike, decreased by $208 million in 2008 primarily due to lower earnings in the BMA segment resulting from a $248 million charge taken on the AEW&C program in the second quarter partially offset by higher earnings in the N&SS Segment. IDS operating earnings increased by $409 million in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to $770 million of charges on AEW&C in 2006. The 2007 increase was partially offset by lower earnings in the N&SS segment and other BMA programs. 32 Table of Contents Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. IDS total backlog increased 2% in 2008, from $71,681 million to $73,004 million, primarily due to multi-year contracts for the V-22 and Chinook and international orders for F-15 and C-17 aircraft. The increases were partially offset by deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years with the largest decreases in the FCS, C-17, F/A-18 and F-22 programs. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished. Examples of these programs include Airborne Laser, EA-18G, Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals, FCS, Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), P-8A and Proprietary programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of these programs include AEW&C, international KC-767 Tanker, commercial and military satellites, Vigilare and High Frequency Modernisation. Boeing Military Aircraft Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 13,492 $ 13,740 $ 14,142 % of Total company revenues 22 % 21 % 23 % Earnings from operations $ 1,276 $ 1,649 $ 1,218 Operating margins 9.5 % 12.0 % 8.6 % Research and development $ 482 $ 450 $ 395 Contractual backlog $ 25,855 $ 23,047 $ 24,885 Unobligated backlog $ 10,057 $ 8,625 $ 8,891 Revenues BMA revenues decreased 2% in 2008 and 3% in 2007. The decrease of $248 million in 2008 is primarily driven by lower F-22, Apache, F-18 and Chinook revenue partially offset by increased deliveries on F-15 and International KC-767 Tankers and C-17 contract mix. The decrease of $402 million in 2007 was due to reduced deliveries of the Apache and T-45 aircraft and Joint Direct Attack Munitions, partially offset by higher deliveries of Chinook and F/A-18 aircraft and higher volume on the P-8A program. 33 Table of Contents Deliveries of new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 F/A-18 Models 45 44 42 T-45TS Goshawk 7 9 13 F-15E Eagle 14 12 12 C-17 Globemaster 16 16 16 KC-767 Tanker 2 CH-47 Chinook 12 10 2 AH-64 Apache 3 17 31 C-40A Clipper 3 1 Total New-Build Production Aircraft 99 111 117 Operating Earnings BMA operating earnings decreased by $373 million in 2008 primarily due to a charge of $248 million taken on the AEW&C program in the second quarter. Delivery mix, lower volume and the IAM strike also contributed to the decrease in 2008. Operating earnings increased by $431 million in 2007 primarily due to the 2006 charges of $770 million on AEW&C, which were partially offset by lower 2007 earnings due to revised cost estimates on the international KC-767 Tanker program, lower prices on the C-17 program and revised cost and revenue estimates on the AEW&C program. Research and Development The BMA segment continues to focus research and development resources to leverage customer knowledge, technical strength and large-scale integration capabilities that provide innovative solutions to meet the warfighter’s enduring needs. Research and development has remained consistent over the past several years. Research and development activities utilize our capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to enhance our customers’ capabilities in the areas of mobility, precision effects, situational awareness and survivability. These efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness and interoperability, and improving affordability, reliability and economic ownership. Backlog BMA total backlog increased by 13% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in the V-22, Chinook and F-15 program backlog. These increases were partially offset by deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years with the largest decreases in the C-17 and F/A-18 programs. Total backlog decreased by 6% in 2007 compared with 2006 primarily due to deliveries and sales on C-17, F/A-18, P-8A and F-15. These decreases were partially offset by a multi-year contract for F-22 aircraft and international orders for AEW&C and F/A-18 aircraft. Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on BMA operations include the following: AEW&C During 2006, we recorded charges of $770 million and during the second quarter of 2008 we recorded a charge of $248 million related to revised cost and revenue estimates to complete the AEW&C programs in Australia and Turkey. The 2008 charge is primarily related to our program in Australia and is due to subsystem development issues on the electronic warfare and ground support systems and the additional time required for integration testing. These factors required a revised delivery schedule for the Australian aircraft. These delays are not expected to affect delivery schedules to our other AEW&C customers. The AEW&C development program, also known as Wedgetail in Australia, Peace Eagle in Turkey and Peace Eye in the Republic of Korea, consists of a 737-700 aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems, some of which 34 Table of Contents have never been installed on an airplane before. Wedgetail includes six aircraft and Peace Eagle and Peace Eye include four aircraft each. These are advanced and complex fixed-price development programs involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability. We believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate; however, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be delayed. International KC-767 Tanker Program During 2008 and 2007, the BMA segment recorded charges of $85 million and $152 million. The 2007 charge was partially offset at the consolidated level. The international KC-767 Tanker program includes four aircraft for the Italian Air Force and four aircraft for the Japanese Air Self Defense Force. We delivered the first two tankers to Japan during the first quarter of 2008. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion and development costs may be necessary or remaining scheduled delivery dates could be delayed. C-17 As of December 31, 2008, we delivered 182 of the 190 C-17 aircraft ordered by the U.S. Air Force (USAF), with final deliveries scheduled for 2009. In June 2007 and April 2008, we directed key suppliers to begin work on 10 and 20 aircraft, respectively, beyond the 190 to support potential Fiscal Year 2008 (FY08) and Fiscal Year 2009 (FY09) orders and anticipated international orders. Our authorizations allowed us to maintain the current C-17 production rate and to provide for cost-effective acquisition of the aircraft. As of December 31, 2008, inventory expenditures and potential termination liabilities to suppliers, primarily related to the anticipated FY08 USAF order, totaled approximately $720 million. In June 2008, the FY08 supplemental defense spending bill, signed by the President, included funding for up to an additional 15 C-17 aircraft. The USAF placed these aircraft on contract on February 6, 2009. There continues to be substantial interest in purchasing additional C-17 aircraft from both the U.S. government and international customers. The National Defense Authorization Act signed into law by the President authorizes the procurement of six C-17s in FY09. However, funding would need to be addressed in a future defense appropriations bill. Should additional orders not materialize, it is reasonably possible that we will decide in 2009 to complete production of the C-17. We are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shut-down, including any recovery that would be available from the government. Such recovery from the government would not include the costs incurred by us resulting from our direction to key suppliers to begin working on aircraft beyond the 190 ordered by the USAF. Network and Space Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 11,338 $ 11,475 $ 11,767 % of Total company revenues 19 % 17 % 19 % Earnings from operations $ 1,033 $ 862 $ 924 Operating margins 9.1 % 7.5 % 7.9 % Research and development $ 298 $ 289 $ 289 Contractual backlog $ 8,864 $ 9,204 $ 7,784 Unobligated backlog $ 16,980 $ 20,133 $ 23,755 35 Table of Contents Revenues N&SS revenues decreased 1% in 2008 and 2% in 2007. The decrease of $137 million in 2008 is primarily due to decreased revenues in FCS, Proprietary and satellite programs partially offset by increased revenues in the SBInet program. The decrease of $292 million in 2007 was primarily due to the exclusion of government Delta volume, now a component of our equity investment in ULA and lower FCS volume, partially offset by increased volume on SBInet and several satellite programs. Delta launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Delta II Commercial 2 3 Delta II Government 2 Delta IV Government 3 Satellites 1 4 4 Delta government launches are excluded from our deliveries after December 1, 2006 due to the formation of ULA. Operating Earnings N&SS operating earnings increased by $171 million in 2008 was primarily due to increased earnings from our investment in ULA. The decrease in 2007 was due to lower earnings on FCS and several satellite programs. These decreases were partially offset by higher award fees on GMD and a $44 million gain on sale of a property in Anaheim. N&SS operating earnings include equity earnings of $73 million, $85 million and $71 million from the United Space Alliance joint venture in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively and equity earnings of $105 million, a loss of $11 million and equity earnings of $5 million from the ULA joint venture in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The ULA equity earnings and loss amounts are net of the basis difference amortization. Research and Development The N&SS research and development funding remains focused on the development of communications, command and control, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems (C4ISR); communications and command and control (C3) capabilities that support a network-enabled architecture approach for our various government customers. We are investing in communications capabilities to enable connectivity between existing air/ground platforms, increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and leverage innovative communications concepts. Key programs in this area include JTRS, FCS, Global Positioning System, Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, Ares 1 Crew Launch Vehicle and GMD. Investments were also made to support concepts that may lead to the development of next-generation space intelligence systems. Along with increased funding to support these areas of architecture and network-enabled capabilities development, we also maintained our investment levels in global missile defense and advanced missile defense concepts and technologies. Backlog N&SS total backlog decreased by 12% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to revenues recognized on multi-year orders received in prior years on FCS, GMD and C3 programs, partially offset by an increase in the International Space Station program. Total backlog decreased by 7% in 2007 compared with 2006 due to revenues recognized on FCS and Proprietary programs, partially offset by an increase in Space Exploration programs. Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on N&SS operations include the following: United Launch Alliance On December 1, 2006, we completed the transaction with Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) to create a 50/50 joint venture named United Launch Alliance L.L.C. (ULA). ULA combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Atlas rockets. In connection with the transaction, 36 Table of Contents we initially contributed net assets of $914 million at December 1, 2006. The book value of our investment exceeds our proportionate share of ULA’s net assets. This difference will be expensed ratably in future years. Based on the adjusted contributions and the conformed accounting policies established by ULA, this amortization is expected to be approximately $15 million annually for the next 16 years. In connection with the formation of ULA, we and Lockheed each committed to provide up to $25 million in additional capital contributions and we each have agreed to extend a line of credit to ULA of up to $200 million to support its working capital requirements. We and Lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain U.S. government contracts to ULA as of the closing date. We and Lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the U.S. government. ULA made a $100 million earnings distribution to each partner during the fourth quarter of 2008. In conjunction with the distribution, we and Lockheed committed to provide ULA with additional capital contributions up to the amount of such distributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under the inventory supply agreement. See Note 6 and Note 10. We agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability of $1,375 million of Boeing Delta inventories included in contributed assets plus $1,860 million of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA sold $548 million of inventories that were contributed by us. As part of its integration, ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program beyond what is currently on contract. Future decisions regarding the Delta II program could reduce our earnings by up to $90 million. We agreed to indemnify ULA in the event ULA is unable to obtain re-pricing of certain contracts which we contributed to ULA and to which we believe ULA is entitled. We will be responsible for any shortfall and may record up to $386 million in pre-tax losses related to these contracts. Sea Launch The Sea Launch venture, in which we are a 40% partner, provides ocean-based launch services to commercial satellite customers. We issued credit guarantees to creditors of the Sea Launch venture to assist it in obtaining financing and other support. In the event we are required to perform on these guarantees, we believe we can recover a portion of the cost (estimated at $271 million) through guarantees from the other venture partners. We have also made loans directly to Sea Launch in the past. In the event that Sea Launch is unable to repay those loans, we believe we can recover a portion of the cost (estimated at $203 million) from the other venture partners. The components of this exposure are as follows: (Dollars in Millions) EstimatedMaximumExposure EstablishedReserves EstimatedProceedsfromRecourse EstimatedNetExposure Credit guarantees $ 451 $ 180 $ 271 Partner Loans (principal and interest) 508 305 203 Trade receivable from Sea Launch 385 377 8 Subcontract termination 7 7 Other receivables and Inventory 62 41 21 $ 1,413 $ 903 $ 474 $ 36 We made no additional capital contributions to the Sea Launch venture during the year ended December 31, 2008. Our trade receivable increased from $337 million at December 31, 2007 to $385 37 Table of Contents million at December 31, 2008. The related allowance for losses increased from $334 million at December 31, 2007 to $377 million at December 31, 2008 reflecting Sea Launch’s ongoing liquidity challenges. The venture conducted five, zero and five successful launches for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. The venture has incurred losses during 2008, 2007 and 2006. The losses in 2008 and 2006 were due to the relatively low price of launches, driven by a depressed commercial satellite market and oversupply of launch vehicles as well as a high level of debt and debt servicing requirements. The venture incurred losses in 2007 due to a delay in its 2007 launch manifest that was caused by a launch anomaly in January 2007 and unusually strong ocean currents at the launch site during November and December. We suspended recording equity losses after writing our investment in and direct loans to Sea Launch down to zero in 2001 and accruing our obligation for third-party guarantees on Sea Launch indebtedness. We are not obligated to provide any further financial support to the Sea Launch venture. However, in the event that we do extend additional financial support to Sea Launch in the future, we will recognize suspended losses as appropriate. Approximately $250 million of Sea Launch’s bank loans expire during 2009. In the event this amount is refinanced, Boeing may be called upon to renew its credit guarantee to Sea Launch lenders; or, in the event Sea Launch is unable to obtain financing, Boeing may be required to perform on the existing credit guarantee, which could put in default Sea Launch’s other external debt of approximately $200 million. In the event Sea Launch is unable to refinance its debt or meet its other contractual obligations and we are unable to recover guarantees from the other venture partners, we could be required to pay up to $451 million under credit guarantees, which could result in charges of up to $510 million. We continue to look at alternatives to address funding requirements for the venture. Satellites See the discussions of Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. (BSSI) in Note 20 Legal Proceedings. Global Services and Support Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 7,217 $ 6,837 $ 6,502 % of Total company revenues 12 % 10 % 11 % Earnings from operations $ 923 $ 929 $ 889 Operating margins 12.8 % 13.6 % 13.7 % Research and development $ 153 $ 109 $ 102 Contractual backlog $ 10,566 $ 9,537 $ 9,618 Unobligated backlog $ 682 $ 1,135 $ 739 Revenues GS&S revenues increased $380 million in 2008 and $335 million in 2007, an increase of 6% and 5%. The 2008 increase was due to higher revenues in the Training Systems and Services (TS&S) and Integrated Logistics (IL) divisions partially offset by decreases in International Support program volume. The 2007 increase was due to higher IL program volume resulting from the 2006 acquisition of Aviall, Inc. (Aviall) and increased revenue on the C-17 support program. Higher international program volume in 2007 was the result of our increased ownership in Alsalam Aircraft Company (Alsalam) 38 Table of Contents which occurred during the second quarter of 2006. Lower volume on several Maintenance, Modification and Upgrades (MM&U) and TS&S programs partially offset the 2007 increases. Operating Earnings GS&S operating earnings decreased by less than 1% in 2008 due to changes in the contract mix and disposition of contract matters. Operating earnings increased 4% in 2007 driven by the revenue increases mentioned above in addition to a different contract mix. Research and Development GS&S continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including IL, MM&U, TS&S and Advanced Logistics Support Systems, as well as on moving into the innovative Network Centric Logistics areas. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Examples of successful programs stemming from these investment strategies include the C-17 Globemaster Sustainment Partnership, the F/A-18 Integrated Readiness Support Teaming program, and the F-15 Singapore Performance Based Logistics contract. Successful development of adaptable systems has allowed GS&S to transition off Boeing platforms and into the broader aviation market. Beyond aerospace, GS&S capabilities have created opportunities in adjacencies exemplified in 2008 through entrance into the land vehicles market. Backlog GS&S total backlog increased by 5% compared with 2007 primarily due to increases in IL and International Support programs. Total backlog increased by 3% in 2007 compared with 2006 due to increases in TS&S programs and International Support programs which were partially offset by decreases in MM&U and IL programs. Boeing Capital Corporation Business Environment and Trends BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2008 totaled $6,023 million, which was substantially collateralized by Boeing produced commercial aircraft. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is concentrated among U.S. commercial airlines customers. Continued problems in the airline industry could have a negative impact on lease rates, airline credit ratings and aircraft valuations, and BCC’s future results of operations could be adversely affected in the form of lower revenues, increased asset impairments, increased allowance for losses and increased redeployment costs. Continued problems in the airline industry could also affect our Commercial Airplanes and Other segment. The global credit crisis has affected the availability of credit generally. While there are still sources of financing available for aircraft deliveries, the amount of third-party financing available has declined. We expect to finance some new deliveries of Boeing aircraft in 2009 and expect our portfolio size to increase. Once capital market conditions improve, we believe the overall aircraft financing market should improve as well and lessen the need for us to provide financing for Boeing aircraft deliveries, although we can provide no assurance when that will occur. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,200 western-built commercial jet aircraft (11.0% of current world fleet) were parked as of December 2008, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types, of which over 40% are not expected to return to service. In December 2007 and 2006, 8.2% and 9.9% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. 39 Table of Contents Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 703 $ 815 $ 1,025 Earnings from operations $ 162 $ 234 $ 291 Operating margins 23 % 29 % 28 % Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes. BCC’s revenues decreased $112 million in 2008, resulting from lower interest income on financing receivables and notes of $66 million primarily due to the prepayment of certain notes and lower investment income of $20 million resulting from a lower investment balance. BCC’s revenues decreased $210 million in 2007, primarily due to lower interest income on notes receivable, lower investment income and lower net gain on disposal of assets. Operating earnings BCC’s operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings decreased by $72 million in 2008 primarily due to lower revenues and a provision for losses partially offset by lower interest expense. The decrease in operating earnings in 2007 compared with 2006 was primarily due to lower revenues. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31,: (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 BCC Customer Financing and Investment Portfolio $ 6,023 $ 6,532 Valuation Allowance as a % of Total Receivables 2.1 % 2.5 % Debt $ 3,652 $ 4,327 Debt-to-Equity Ratio 5.0-to-1 5.0-to-1 BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2008 decreased from December 31, 2007 due to normal portfolio run-off. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, BCC had $685 million and $86 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease of which $305 million and $86 million had firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. The increase in assets held for sale or re-lease primarily resulted from the return of 16 717 aircraft previously leased to Midwest Airlines (Midwest) and the return of four 757 aircraft previously leased to ATA Holdings Corp., which filed for bankruptcy protection on April 2, 2008. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $168 million are scheduled to be returned off lease in the next 12 months. These aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and $64 million were committed at December 31, 2008. BCC enters into certain transactions with the Other segment in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies. 40 Table of Contents Restructurings and Restructuring Requests As of December 31, 2008, BCC has received a number of requests from both domestic and foreign airlines to reduce lease or rental payments or to otherwise restructure obligations. Whether such requests will result in a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flow or financial position depends on a number of factors including whether the request is granted, the type of aircraft, the collateral value and market rental rates of the returned aircraft. In September 2008, we agreed to a restructuring of lease terms with Midwest, under which Midwest returned 16 of 25 717 aircraft. Additionally, the agreement provides us with options to require Midwest to return the remaining nine 717 aircraft with varying notice periods. We are pursuing remarketing options for the aircraft returned to date and expected to be returned in the future. We do not expect that the return of these aircraft as a result of this restructuring will have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flow. Other Segment (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Revenues $ 567 $ 308 $ 327 Earnings from operations $ (307 ) $ (331 ) $ (813 ) Operating margins -54 % -107 % -249 % Effective January 1, 2008, certain intercompany items were realigned between the Other segment and Unallocated expense. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. Other segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $259 million compared with 2007 primarily due to the sale of four C-17 aircraft held under operating lease, three of which were sold in 2008. Other segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by $24 million compared with 2007 primarily due to lower environmental and certain other charges offset by the recognition of a provision for losses of $82 million related to lower U.S. airline customer credit ratings. The provision for losses amount has been recorded in the Other segment as a result of intercompany guarantees we provide to BCC. In 2008, Other segment included environmental remediation expense of $59 million compared with $109 million in 2007. Other segment operating losses were $331 million during 2007 as compared to losses of $813 million in 2006. The reduction of $482 million was primarily due to the absence of losses related to Connexion by Boeing, which we exited in 2006. As part of our exit from this business, we recognized a charge of $320 million in 2006, in addition to losses of $237 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. We have not reached final settlements with all customers or suppliers. We do not believe the final settlements will have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. 41 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 Net earnings $ 2,672 $ 4,074 $ 2,215 Non-cash items 1,829 1,753 2,351 Changes in working capital (4,902 ) 3,757 2,933 Net cash (used)/provided by operating activities (401 ) 9,584 7,499 Net cash provided/(used) by investing activities 1,888 (3,822 ) (3,186 ) Net cash used by financing activities (5,202 ) (4,884 ) (3,645 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (59 ) 46 38 Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents (3,774 ) 924 706 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 7,042 6,118 5,412 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 3,268 $ 7,042 $ 6,118 Operating Activities In 2008, operating activities resulted in a $401 million cash outflow in contrast to 2007 and 2006 when our operations generated significant cash surpluses of $9,584 million and $7,499 million. The decline in 2008 was primarily attributable to higher working capital requirements. In 2007 and 2006, customer advances increased at a faster rate than inventory. In 2008 inventory grew at a faster rate than customer advances. The 2008 increase in inventories was driven by continued spending on production materials, airplane engines, and supplier advances during the IAM strike, lower commercial airplane deliveries and the continued ramp-up of the 787 program. We expect to generate positive operating cash flows in 2009. Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $2,085 million to $9,584 million in 2007, primarily due to an increase in Net earnings. Net working capital improvements in 2007 reflect higher advances driven by commercial airplane orders and decreases in customer financing assets due to pre-payment of certain notes receivable and normal portfolio run-off, which were partially offset by an increase in inventories driven by the continued ramp-up of the 787 program. Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities totaled $1,888 million in 2008 compared with $3,822 million used in 2007, largely due to the liquidation in 2008 of our investments in time deposits and commercial paper, and the liquidation of the majority of our investments in externally managed fixed income instruments, partially offset by $964 million of spending in 2008 on acquisitions. Cash used for investing activities increased to $3,822 million in 2007 from $3,186 million in 2006, largely due to increases in short-term investments, partially offset by our investment in the acquisition of Aviall in 2006. 42 Table of Contents The balance of time deposits, commercial paper and externally managed fixed income instruments classified as investments at December 31 are summarized in the table below. (Dollars in millions) 2008 2007 2006 Classified as Short-term investments Time deposits $ 1,025 Commercial paper 799 Externally managed fixed income instruments(1) $ 10 306 $ 257 10 2,130 257 Classified as Investments Externally managed fixed income instruments(1) 338 2,963 2,923 $ 348 $ 5,093 $ 3,180 (1) Externally managed fixed income instruments consist primarily of investment grade instruments. These investments had an average duration of 5.5 years at December 31, 2008 and are classified as available-for-sale. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities increased to $5,202 million in 2008 from $4,884 million in 2007 due to repayments of financed purchases of distribution rights, which are agreements with certain vendors that gives us exclusive rights to sell their applicable parts. The increase was also due to a decrease in stock options exercised, an increase in common share repurchases and payments of employee taxes on certain share-based payment arrangements, partially offset by a reduction in debt repayments. Cash used by financing activities increased to $4,884 million in 2007 from $3,645 million in 2006 primarily due to increased common share repurchases. During 2008, we repurchased 42,073,885 shares at an average price of $69.79 in our open market share repurchase program, 1,462,776 shares at an average price of $64.95 as part of the ShareValue Trust distribution, and 74,824 shares in stock swaps. During 2007, we repurchased 28,995,599 shares at an average price of $95.68 in our open market share repurchase program and 28,432 shares in stock swaps. During 2006, we repurchased 21,184,202 shares at an average price of $80.18 in our open market share repurchase program, 3,749,377 shares at an average price of $80.28 as part of the ShareValue Trust distribution, and 49,288 shares in stock swaps. We expect to reduce 2009 share repurchase activity to a minimal level. In 2008, we repaid $738 million of debt, including $709 million of debt held at BCC. In 2007, we repaid $1,406 million of debt, including $1,309 million of debt held at BCC. In 2006, we repaid $1,681 million of debt, including $713 million of debt held at BCC and $458 million of debt assumed in the Aviall acquisition. There were no debt issuances during 2008, 2007, or 2006. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, the recorded balance of debt was $7,512 million and $8,217 million, of which $560 million and $762 million were classified as short-term. This includes $3,652 million and $4,327 million of debt recorded at BCC, of which $528 million and $706 million was classified as short-term. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings are summarized below: Fitch Moody’s Standard &Poor’s Long-term: Boeing/BCC A+ A2 A+ Short-term: Boeing/BCC F1 P-1 A-1 43 Table of Contents On January 29, 2009 Standard & Poor’s confirmed Boeing’s A+ credit rating but changed its outlook from stable to negative, citing the challenging commercial aviation environment. Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2008 and at December 31, 2008, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $3,000 million ($1,500 million exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements, of which $2,000 million is a 5-year credit facility expiring in November 2012 and $1,000 million is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2009. Both the 5-year and 364-day credit facilities have a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration dates. In 2008, we renewed the $1,000 million 364-day revolving credit facility, of which $500 million is allocated to BCC. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support possible commercial paper borrowings in 2009. BCC has a $5,000 million shelf registration statement that was declared effective on November 12, 2008 under which it may offer debt securities. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. At this point in time, our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment, and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by the ongoing capital market disruptions. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers’ Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans – an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS 158), we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, with a corresponding after-tax adjustment to Accumulated other comprehensive loss. The 2008 annual remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement plans resulted in a net $8,565 million decrease in Shareholders’ equity, primarily due to declines in our pension plan assets, as a result of declines in financial markets. As a result of the pension remeasurement, we have negative Shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2008. We do not expect negative Shareholders’ equity to affect our ability to pay dividends or comply with debt covenants. The 2007 annual remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement plans resulted in a net $3,441 million increase in Shareholders’ equity. At December 31, 2008 our pension plans were $8,420 million underfunded as measured under GAAP and, in the aggregate, approximately $3,000 million underfunded as measured under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The difference in the funded status between the two standards is mostly attributable to the fact that ERISA uses average asset values and discount rates, whereas GAAP requires us to measure our plan assets and discount our benefit obligations as of the end of the year. Required contributions under ERISA, as well as rules governing funding of our non-U.S. pension plans, are not expected to exceed $50 million in 2009. We anticipate contributing approximately $500 million to our pension plans in 2009. Absent a recovery of asset values or higher interest rates, we will be required to make higher contributions in future years. As of December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. 44 Table of Contents Disclosures about Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2008, and the estimated timing thereof. Contractual Obligations (Dollars in millions) Total Less than1 year 1-3years 3-5years After 5years Long-term debt (including current portion) $ 7,432 $ 551 $ 1,533 $ 2,495 $ 2,853 Interest on debt* 5,055 453 795 532 3,275 Pension and other post retirement cash requirements 11,222 692 1,486 5,139 3,905 Capital lease obligations 81 10 20 22 29 Operating lease obligations 1,171 219 315 148 489 Purchase obligations not recorded on statement of financial position 114,659 33,960 42,967 27,468 10,264 Purchase obligations recorded on statement of financial position 11,338 10,512 488 323 15 Total contractual obligations $ 150,958 $ 46,397 $ 47,604 $ 36,127 $ 20,830 * Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2008. Variable rate debt was approximately 3% of our total debt at December 31, 2008. Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2008, our total liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $1,195 million, of which $41 million we expect to pay in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $1,154 million. Our income tax obligations are excluded from the table above. See Note 4. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to a single plan that is funded through a trust. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, the agreements are not cancelable without substantial penalty. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the statements of financial position. Approximately 10% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement 45 Table of Contents through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2008, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2008, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $9 billion that extend through 2024. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable. Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2008. (Dollars in millions) Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $ 5,763 $ 5,027 $ 616 $ 120 Commercial aircraft financing commitments 10,145 2,445 2,621 $ 3,054 2,025 Total commercial commitments $ 15,908 $ 7,472 $ 3,237 $ 3,054 $ 2,145 Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest funding dates. Based on historical experience, we currently do not anticipate that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers, see Note 11. Industrial Revenue Bonds We utilize Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRB) to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property, see Note 12. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20, including our contesting the default termination of the A-12 aircraft, employment and benefits litigation brought by several of our employees, and litigation/arbitration involving BSSI programs. 46 Table of Contents Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $731 million at December 31, 2008. For additional information, see Note 11. Income Taxes We have recorded a net liability of $1,453 million at December 31, 2008 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of these contingencies, see Note 4. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. The Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contract’s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in IDS for all of 2008 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $320 million. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and 47 Table of Contents anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs, excluding the 747 program, for all of 2008 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $200 million. The 747 program is in a reach-forward loss position. Absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs, subsequent deliveries are recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately. Aircraft Valuation Impairment Review for Assets Under Operating Leases and Held for Re-Lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. 48 Table of Contents Had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. Allowance for Losses on Customer Financing Receivables The allowance for losses on receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings, collateral values and default rates. If each customer’s credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at December 31, 2008, the allowance would have decreased by $109 million or increased by $251 million. If the collateral values were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2008, the allowance would have decreased by $66 million or increased by $71 million. If the cumulative default rates used for each rating category should increase or decrease 1%, the allowance would have increased by $5 million or decreased by $5 million. Lease Residual Values Equipment under operating leases is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases. If the estimated residual values declined 5% at December 31, 2008, this would result in a future cumulative pre-tax earnings impact of $75 million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods, of which $7 million would be recognized in 2009. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. April 1 is our annual testing date. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded. Since the date of our annual impairment test on April 1, we have updated our forecasts to reflect among other things the global economic downturn, delays in development programs, and the impacts of the recent IAM strike. Because of these changes in circumstances, we have verified that goodwill is not impaired as of December 31, 2008. However, further changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations will have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill. 49 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, we had $499 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows could result in an impairment charge of approximately $17 million. Postretirement Plans Substantially all our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans. We also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements require several assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Changes in assumptions can significantly affect our future annual expense and projected benefit obligations. In addition, as a result of our adoption of SFAS 158, differences between actual and expected returns on assets, changes in assumptions, and changes in plan provisions could significantly increase or decrease Shareholders’ Equity (net of taxes) at future measurement dates. Effective for December 31, 2008, SFAS 158 requires us to measure our plan assets and benefit obligations as of December 31, our year-end. Previously, our annual measurement date was September 30. We use a discount rate that is based on a point-in-time estimate as of our December 31 annual measurement date. Changes in the discount rate will increase or decrease our recorded liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to Shareholders’ Equity as of the measurement date. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate. As of December 31, 2008 (in millions) Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bps Pension plans Dollars Dollars Projected benefit obligation (pensions) (1,350 ) 1,599 Net periodic pension cost (164 ) 181 Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (165 ) 180 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost (14 ) 14 Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2008 net periodic pension expense by $116 million. For 2009, we are reducing our expected rate of return on pension plan assets by 25 basis points to 8.00% which will increase 2009 net periodic pension cost by approximately $100 million. Differences between actual and expected returns can affect future year’s pension cost. The asset balance used to calculate the expected return on pension plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of assets over a five year period. Losses incurred on our pension investments in 2008 will increase 2009 net periodic pension cost by approximately $450 million through a combination of lower expected returns on assets and higher amortization of actuarial losses. Absent a recovery of asset values or higher interest rates or higher contributions, net periodic pension expense will increase further in future years. 50 Table of Contents The assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following year’s expense, recorded liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change. As of December 31, 2008 (in millions) Change in medical trend rateIncrease 100 bps Change in medical trend rateDecrease 100 bps Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation 640 (567 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost 120 (106 ) Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally investments, fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to interest rate changes. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. The principal source of BCC’s market risk relates to interest rate changes. Exposure to this risk is managed by generally matching the profile of BCC’s liabilities with that of BCC’s assets in relation to amount and terms such as expected maturities and fixed versus floating interest rates. Interest rate derivatives are tools used to assist with this matching and are not used for speculative purposes. Matching is a dynamic process affected by changes in our assets that may require adjusting our liabilities and/or derivatives. Although many of the assets, liabilities and derivatives affected by a change in interest rates are not traded, if we had an immediate, one-time, 100 basis-point increase in market rates at December 31, 2008, we estimate that the tax-adjusted net fair value of these items would have decreased by $1 million compared to a decrease of $12 million at December 31, 2007. Based on the portfolio of other Boeing existing debt, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material. The investors in the fixed-rate debt obligations that we issue do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2008, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized losses by $70 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have decreased our unrealized losses by $196 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. 51 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:29.065522
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors around the world. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes and Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services that open new frontiers in aerospace. We focus on producing the airplanes the market demands and we price our products to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets often offset. BCC delivers value by supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure. Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Commercial Airplanes $ 34,051 $ 28,263 $ 33,386 Boeing Defense, Space & Security 33,661 32,047 32,052 Boeing Capital Corporation 660 703 815 Other segment 165 567 308 Unallocated items and eliminations (256 ) (671 ) (174 ) Total $ 68,281 $ 60,909 $ 66,387 Revenues in 2009 increased by $7,372 million due to higher revenues in Commercial Airplanes and BDS. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $5,788, primarily due to higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2009. Deliveries in 2008 were lower as a result of a labor strike in the prior year. Increases were partially offset by decreases in commercial aviation services and intercompany revenues. BDS revenues increased by $1,614 million, primarily due to higher revenues in Global Services & Support (GS&S) and Boeing Military Airplanes (BMA), partially offset by decreases in Network & Space Systems (N&SS). BCC revenues decreased by $43 million during the year primarily due to a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Other segment revenues decreased by $402 million partly due to higher revenues in the prior year from the sale of four C-17 aircraft held under operating lease. Lower Unallocated items and eliminations improved revenues by $415 million primarily due to lower P-8A Poseidon program (P-8A) intercompany revenues recognized by Commercial Airplanes in 2009 compared with 2008. 17 Table of Contents The decrease in 2008 revenues of $5,478 million compared with 2007, is primarily due to lower revenues at Commercial Airplanes. Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $5,123 million, primarily as a result of decreases in new airplane deliveries reflecting the effects of the labor strike, partially offset by higher intercompany revenues and higher pre-strike deliveries and model mix. We delivered 104 fewer airplanes than expected during 2008 due to the strike. This reduced revenue by approximately $6.4 billion for the twelve months ended December 31, 2008. BDS revenues were unchanged as revenue growth in GS&S was offset by decreases in BMA and N&SS. BCC revenues decreased by $112 million primarily due to lower interest income on financing receivables and notes and a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Other segment revenues increased by $259 million primarily due to the sale of four C-17 aircraft during 2008, that were held under an operating lease. Unallocated items and eliminations changed by $497 million, primarily due to the intercompany elimination of P-8A revenues recognized by Commercial Airplanes. Earnings From Operations The following table summarizes our earnings/(loss) from operations: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Commercial Airplanes (583 ) 1,186 $ 3,584 Boeing Defense, Space & Security 3,299 3,232 3,440 Boeing Capital Corporation 126 162 234 Other segment (152 ) (307 ) (331 ) Unallocated items and eliminations (594 ) (323 ) (1,097 ) Total $ 2,096 $ 3,950 $ 5,830 Operating earnings in 2009 decreased by $1,854 million compared with 2008. Commercial Airplanes earnings decreased by $1,769 million primarily due to $2,693 million of costs related to the first three 787 flight test aircraft included in research and development expense as a result of our determination in August 2009 that these aircraft could not be sold. The earnings decrease is also attributable to reach-forward losses on the 747 program which grew by $1,352 million in 2009 which is an increase of $667 million over 2008. Lower commercial aviation services and intercompany earnings also contributed to lower 2009 earnings. These decreases were partially offset by higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2009 compared with 2008. BDS earnings increased by $67 million compared with 2008 primarily due to higher earnings in the BMA segment partially offset by lower earnings in the N&SS segment. BCC operating earnings decreased $36 million reflecting lower revenues, higher impairment expense and a provision for losses, partially offset by lower interest expense. Other segment losses decreased by $155 million primarily due to recognition of pre-tax expense of $82 million in the prior year to increase the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables and lower environmental remediation charges compared with the prior year. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2009 reduced earnings by $271 million compared with 2008, which is further explained in the table below. Operating earnings in 2008 decreased by $1,880 million compared with 2007. Commercial Airplanes earnings decreased by $2,398 million compared with the same period in 2007, primarily due to fewer new airplane deliveries resulting from the strike, increased program infrastructure costs related to the strike and revised schedules on 787 and 747-8, and a charge taken on the 747-8 program. Commercial Airplanes’ research and development expense decreased by $124 million to $2,838 million compared with the same period in 2007, primarily due to lower spending on 787 partially offset by higher spending on 747-8 and lower supplier development cost sharing payments. BDS earnings decreased by $208 million compared with 2007 primarily due to lower earnings in the BMA segment resulting from charges taken on the Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C). BCC operating 18 Table of Contents earnings decreased $72 million reflecting lower revenues and a provision for losses partially offset by lower interest expense. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2008 improved by $774 million compared with 2007, which is further explained in the table below. The most significant items included in Unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Share-based plans expense $ (189 ) $ (149 ) $ (233 ) Deferred compensation expense/(income) (158 ) 223 (51 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations (264 ) (110 ) (127 ) Pension 110 (208 ) (561 ) Postretirement (93 ) (79 ) (125 ) Total $ (594 ) $ (323 ) $ (1,097 ) The reduction in Share-based plans expense in 2008 is primarily due to the expiration of certain Performance Shares during 2008 and higher expense acceleration during 2007, resulting from six payouts compared with zero payouts in 2008. Deferred compensation expense increased by $381 million in 2009 and decreased by $274 million in 2008. The year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions. Other unallocated items and eliminations expense increased by $154 million in 2009 primarily due to timing of intercompany expense allocations, elimination of profit on intercompany items and a more favorable insurance adjustment in the same periods of the prior year. Other unallocated items and expense in 2008 includes a charge related to satellite litigation of $100 million, offset by lower performance-based compensation in 2008. Unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of $1,816 million, $1,132 million and $1,773 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period. A portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense. Earnings from operations included the following amounts allocated to business segments and Other unallocated items and eliminations. (Dollars in millions) Pension Other PostretirementBenefits Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2009 2008 2007 Allocated to business segments $ (989 ) $ (488 ) $ (521 ) $ (522 ) (428 ) (523 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations 110 (208 ) (561 ) (93 ) (79 ) (125 ) Total $ (879 ) $ (696 ) $ (1,082 ) $ (615 ) (507 ) (648 ) 19 Table of Contents Other Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Earnings from operations $ 2,096 $ 3,950 $ 5,830 Other (expense)/income, net (26 ) 247 484 Interest and debt expense (339 ) (202 ) (196 ) Earnings before income taxes 1,731 3,995 6,118 Income tax expense (396 ) (1,341 ) (2,060 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $ 1,335 $ 2,654 $ 4,058 Other income decreased by $273 million and $237 million in 2009 and 2008. The decreases are primarily driven by a reduction in investment income as a result of lower interest rates and lower investment balances. Interest and debt expense increased by $137 million compared with 2008 due to additional debt issued in 2009. For a discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 5. Backlog Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: (dollars in millions) 2009 2008 2007 Contractual backlog: Commercial Airplanes $ 250,476 $ 278,575 $ 255,176 Boeing Defense, Space & Security: Boeing Military Aircraft 26,311 25,710 22,974 Network & Space Systems 7,746 8,868 9,207 Global Services & Support 11,967 10,707 9,607 Total Boeing Defense, Space & Security 46,024 45,285 41,788 Total contractual backlog $ 296,500 $ 323,860 $ 296,964 Unobligated backlog $ 19,058 $ 28,066 $ 30,173 Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2009 was due to deliveries in excess of orders, changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders. The increase in backlog during 2008 was due to orders in excess of deliveries for our 737, 767, 777 and 787 programs. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding have not been authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2009 is primarily due to decreases at BDS of $8,904 million compared with 2008 partly due to a partial termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the Brigade Combat Team Modernization (BCTM) (formerly the Future Combat Systems (FCS)) System Development and Demonstration contract relating to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. Approved funding of existing multi-year contracts including the BCTM, V-22, Chinook, Proprietary and Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) programs also reduced unobligated backlog. The decrease in Unobligated backlog during 2008 is primarily due to decreases at BDS of $2,174 million compared with 2007 primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts including the F/A-18, BCTM and F-22 programs. These decreases were partially offset by multi-year procurement contracts awarded on the V-22 and Chinook programs. 20 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment 2008 and 2009 were extremely challenging for the world’s airlines as key external business factors (oil prices, economic growth, exchange rates, financing terms) experienced high levels of volatility. In the first half of 2008, airlines focused on adapting to spiking oil prices which peaked close to $150/barrel. In autumn 2008, the airlines’ focus shifted to the fallout of the global credit crisis and recession as fuel prices fell below $40/barrel for the first time since 2004, and in 2009 passenger and cargo traffic experienced their worst ever declines. This business environment curtailed the airline industry profit recovery that started in 2006. As a result, the global airline industry has now reported losses in seven out of the last ten years, and over 30 airlines have entered bankruptcy since the beginning of 2008. In this challenging environment, airlines are adapting their operations to meet the realities of the markets in which they operate. Airlines reduced global passenger capacity by 2% in 2009 through a combination of frequency and route cuts in unprofitable markets, lower daily airplane utilization (flight hours per day) and parking/scrapping of older generation airplanes. Airlines are also replacing older less fuel efficient airplanes, reducing non-fuel costs and finding new ways to partner through alliances or via mergers and acquisitions. These conditions have caused customers to request cancellations, modifications, or rescheduling of their existing orders and advance payment schedules to meet revised fleet plans or address financing and cash flow issues. Whether such requests will result in a material adverse impact on our earnings, cash flow or financial position depends on a number of factors including whether the request is granted, the type of aircraft, how much compensation is paid to us for costs already incurred and our ability to reschedule other orders to replace those canceled, modified, or rescheduled. Near-term global airline industry indicators are improving although many uncertainties persist. Global economic recovery has begun. Although it is expected to vary significantly by region both in terms of speed and magnitude, world economic growth is forecast to grow moderately in 2010 following contraction in 2009. As a result, airline industry forecasts generally indicate global passenger traffic returning close to 2008 levels in 2010 with many emerging markets posting growth over 2009. Air cargo traffic is forecast to grow above the long-term trend rates in 2010 following two years of contraction which have taken traffic back to 2002 and 2003 levels. Due to these improving demand conditions, airlines are expected to see significantly smaller financial losses globally in 2010. Beyond the near-term market uncertainties, the long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger and cargo traffic based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $3.2 trillion market for 29,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including disease outbreaks (such as avian or H1N1 flus), terrorism and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long-term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in 21 Table of Contents Europe and Asia has enabled low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 10% of Commercial Airplanes’ contractual backlog in dollar terms is with U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are likely to enter the 70 to 190 seat aircraft market over the next few years. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. A decline of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies as experienced in the second half of 2009 puts pressure on competitors’ revenues and profits. Competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. Airbus has announced such initiatives targeting overhead cost savings, a reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity through 2012. If the U.S. dollar strengthens again, Airbus can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Revenues $ 34,051 $ 28,263 $ 33,386 % of Total company revenues 50 % 46 % 50 % (Loss)/earnings from operations $ (583 ) $ 1,186 $ 3,584 Operating margins -1.7 % 4.2 % 10.7 % Research and development $ 5,383 $ 2,838 $ 2,962 Contractual backlog $ 250,476 $ 278,575 $ 255,176 22 Table of Contents Revenues Year-over-year changes in Revenue are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) 2009vs. 2008 2008vs. 2007 New airplane sales $ 6,129 $ (4,876 ) Aircraft trading (33 ) (264 ) Commercial aviation services business (308 ) 17 Total $ 5,788 $ (5,123 ) The increase in revenue of $5,788 million in 2009 from 2008 is primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries partially offset by lower intercompany revenues. Prior year revenues were negatively impacted by the 2008 IAM strike. The decrease in revenues from commercial aviation services business was driven by economic conditions. The decrease in revenue of $5,123 million in 2008 from 2007 is primarily attributable to lower new airplane deliveries. The IAM strike resulted in 104 airplane deliveries moving out of 2008 which reduced 2008 revenues by $6,406 million. The strike impact was partially offset by higher intercompany revenues of $804 million, and higher pre-strike deliveries, net of model mix changes, of $726 million. Aircraft trading activity decreased by $264 million as a result of fewer sales of used aircraft. Revenues in commercial aviation services business increased by $17 million driven by increased spares and services revenue offset by decreased passenger to freighter conversions. Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31, were as follows: 737 747 767 777 Total 2009 Cumulative Deliveries 3,128 1,418 982 836 Deliveries 372 * 8 13 88 481 2008 Cumulative Deliveries 2,756 1,410 969 748 Deliveries 290 * 14 10 * 61 375 2007 Cumulative Deliveries 2,466 1,396 959 687 Deliveries 330 * 16 12 * 83 441 * Intercompany deliveries included five 737 aircraft in 2009, two 767 aircraft and two 737 aircraft in 2008 and one 767 aircraft and one 737 aircraft in 2007. Earnings From Operations Earnings from operations for 2009 decreased by $1,769 million when compared to 2008, primarily due to the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of $2,481 million related to the three 787 flight test aircraft previously recorded as inventory as of July 31, 2009. Additional production costs incurred between August and December 2009 of $212 million related to those flight-test airplanes were also included in research and development expense. Those amounts were partially offset by a $148 million decrease in other research and development expense. The decrease in earnings is also attributable to reach-forward losses on the 747 program which grew by $1,352 million in 2009 compared with losses of $685 million in 2008. The 2009 reach-forward losses were primarily due to increased production costs, reductions in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and the difficult market conditions affecting the 747-8. Lower commercial aviation services 23 Table of Contents revenues and margins reduced earnings by $245 million. Higher infrastructure cost allocations related to the 787 and 747-8 schedule delays announced in 2008 and 2009 and infrastructure costs incurred during the 2008 IAM strike reduced earnings by $199 million. Increased period and other costs reduced earnings by $47 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased earnings of $1,934 million related to new airplane deliveries. Earnings from operations decreased by $2,398 million in 2008 when compared to 2007, with operating margins decreasing 6.5 percentage points to 4.2%. Lower new airplane deliveries, partially offset by higher intercompany revenues, reduced earnings by $1,400 million. A charge for a reach-forward loss on the 747 program resulting from increases to estimated costs for development and production of 747-8 derivatives reduced 2008 earnings by $685 million. Infrastructure cost allocations related to the 787 and 747-8 schedule delays and infrastructure costs incurred during the IAM strike reduced earnings by $287 million. The 787 and 747-8 schedule delays resulted in production programs receiving larger allocations of current and future infrastructure costs and reduced margins on 2008 deliveries, while the program infrastructure costs incurred during the IAM strike decreased margins on airplanes delivered during the second half of the year. Increased period and other costs reduced earnings by $108 million. A reduction in commercial aviation services volume and mix-related earnings of $42 million was primarily due to a decrease in volume on passenger to freighter conversion programs. Lower research and development costs improved earnings by $124 million. Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before Boeing and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. The decrease in contractual backlog during 2009 was due to deliveries in excess of orders, changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders. The increase in backlog during 2008 was due to orders in excess of deliveries for our 737, 767, 777 and 787 programs. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts and is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs of these contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which does not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity increases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also increases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates. This has the effect of decreasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. 24 Table of Contents The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The table below provides details as of December 31: Program 737 747 767 777 787 2009 Program accounting quantities 4,600 1,499 1,035 1,100 * Undelivered units under firm orders 2,076 108 59 281 851 Cumulative firm orders2 5,204 1,526 1,041 1,117 2008 Program accounting quantities 4,200 1,499 1,023 1,050 * Undelivered units under firm orders1 2,270 114 70 350 910 Cumulative firm orders2 5,026 1,524 1,039 1,098 2007 Program accounting quantities 3,800 1,474 998 950 * Undelivered units under firm orders 2,076 125 52 357 817 Cumulative firm orders2 4,542 1,521 1,011 1,044 * The accounting quantity for the 787 program will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2010. 1 Undelivered units are not adjusted for cancellations subsequent to December 31, 2008. 2 Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. 737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 400 units during 2009 due to the program’s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft. Production rates remained unchanged in 2009. 747 Program There was no change in the accounting quantity for the 747 program during 2009. In 2008, we recorded a charge of $685 million to recognize a reach-forward loss. The charge was primarily related to higher than anticipated costs due to late changes to wing design which drove new load requirements into the fuselage and created other statement of work changes for our suppliers. During 2009, additional charges of $1,352 million were recorded to recognize reach-forward losses. During the first quarter of 2009, we recorded $347 million of a reach-forward loss due to a reduction in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and an increase in estimated costs due to our decisions to reduce twin-aisle production rates which impact production rates beginning in 2010. During the third quarter of 2009 we increased the reach-forward loss on the 747 program by $1,005 million. Of this amount, $643 million was caused by higher estimated production costs, including both additional internal production costs and higher supplier expenses, attributable to greater than expected re-work and disruption in manufacturing due to late maturity of engineering designs as well as the limited availability of engineering resources. The remaining $362 million was primarily due to challenging cargo market conditions and our related decision to defer a planned increase in the 747-8 production rate, which drove higher allocations of fixed costs and caused us to incur volume-based penalties to suppliers. First flight of the 747-8 Freighter is expected to occur during the first quarter of 2010, with the flight test program expected to take place in 2010. First delivery of the 747-8 Freighter is expected in the fourth 25 Table of Contents quarter of 2010. First delivery of the Intercontinental passenger variant remains scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2011. The gap between the delivery of the last 747-400, which occurred in 2009, and first deliveries of the 747-8 will result in lower 747 program revenues. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 12 units during 2009. In April 2009, we announced a delay in previous plans to increase the production rate. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2009. Delivery of the first 777 Freighter occurred in February 2009. In April 2009, we announced that we will lower the production rate on our 777 airplane program, affecting deliveries beginning in June 2010. This lower production rate will decrease revenues and earnings in 2010 and 2011. 787 Program We announced on June 23, 2009 the necessity to reinforce an area of structure at the side-of-body section of the airplane. During the fourth quarter, we completed the modifications on the first two flight-test airplanes and the full-scale static test airplane. First flight of the 787 occurred on December 15, 2009. A second 787 completed its first test flight on December 22, 2009. Six aircraft in total will be involved in the flight test program, which is expected to result in certification of the 787-8 in the fourth quarter of 2010. First delivery is also expected to occur in the fourth quarter of 2010. We continue to work toward our planned increases in 787 production rates as well as the timely introduction of the 787-9 derivative. During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs of $2,481 million previously recorded as program inventory as of July 31, 2009 were reclassified to research and development expense. Additional production costs incurred between August and December 2009 of $212 million related to these flight-test airplanes were also included in research and development expense. We will continue to incur research and development costs on these flight test aircraft in 2010. We believe that the other three additional 787 flight test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to those aircraft in program inventory at December 31, 2009. If we determine that one or more of the other flight test aircraft cannot be sold we may incur additional charges. On July 30, 2009, we acquired the business, assets and operations of Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc.’s (Vought) 787 business conducted at North Charleston, South Carolina. The facility produces aft fuselage sections, including the fabrication, assembly and systems installation. See Note 2. On December 22, 2009, we acquired Alenia North America’s 50% ownership interest in Global Aeronautica. As a result of the transaction, we are the sole owner of this entity. Located adjacent to Boeing Charleston, Global Aeronautica is an integrator of the 787 mid-fuselage sections. On October 28, 2009 we announced the North Charleston facility as the location for a second final assembly site for the 787 Dreamliner program. A groundbreaking ceremony was held November 20, 2009 to mark the start of construction. Until the additional 787 assembly line is fully operational, we will establish transitional surge capability at our Everett, Washington, location to facilitate the planned introduction of the 787-9, the first derivative model of the 787 family. When the additional line in North Charleston is fully operational, the surge capability in Everett will be phased out. Looking beyond first flight, we continue to monitor and address other areas of challenge associated with assembly of initial airplanes including management of our extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work as well as weight and systems integration. Efforts continue to ensure we remain focused on satisfying customer mission and performance needs in light of the anticipated weight of their respective aircraft. 26 Table of Contents We continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes including delivery delays and supplier assertions. A number of our customers have contractual remedies for schedule delays and/or performance. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as brought forth. The cumulative impacts of the flight test delays, production challenges, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts create significant pressure on program revenue and cost estimates. We continue to assess our mitigation plans and cost reduction efforts to address these pressures. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. This level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years. These costs do not vary significantly with current production rates. Research and Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Our Research and development expense increased by $2,545 million in 2009. This was due to reclassification to research and development expense of $2,693 million of production costs related to the three 787 flight test aircraft and $50 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments, partially offset by a $198 million decrease of other research and development expense. Our Research and development expense decreased $124 million in 2008. Research and development expense is net of development cost sharing payments received from suppliers. The decrease in research and development spending for 2008 was primarily due to reduced 787 product development activities partially offset by $278 million of increased spending on the 747-8 program and $80 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments. Additional Considerations The 787 and 747-8 programs highlight the risks that are always inherent in new airplane programs and new derivative airplanes, particularly as both the 747-8 and the 787 begin the demanding flight test and certification phases of program development. Costs related to development of new programs and derivative airplanes are expensed as incurred. Costs to produce new aircraft are included in inventory and accounted for using program accounting. Airplane programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated production costs exceed our estimated program revenues for the accounting quantity. Generally commercial airplanes are sold on a firm fixed-price basis with an indexed price escalation clause and are often sold several years before scheduled delivery. Each customer purchase 27 Table of Contents agreement contains an escalation clause to account for the effects of economic fluctuations over the period of time from airplane sale to airplane delivery. A price escalation formula based on pre-defined factors is used to determine the final price of the airplane at the time of customer delivery. While firm fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. Many new airplanes and derivatives have highly complex designs, utilize exotic materials and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners. As technical or quality issues arise, such as issues experienced on the 787 and 747-8 programs, we may experience schedule delays and higher costs to complete new programs and derivative aircraft. Additionally, price escalation factors may also impact margins by reducing the estimated price of airplanes delivered in the future. There are other factors that could also result in lower margins or a material charge if a program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses. These include: changes to the program accounting quantity, production costs and rates, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs and schedule for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Boeing Defense, Space & Security Business Environment and Trends On January 7, 2010, we announced that Integrated Defense Systems will begin operating under the name Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS). BDS consists of three capabilities-driven businesses: Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA), Network & Space Systems (N&SS) and Global Services & Support (GS&S). Additionally, BDS Phantom Works supports all three businesses via product development, rapid prototyping and customer engagement through experimentation and enterprise technology investment strategies. Defense Environment Overview The U.S. continues to balance funding priorities to plan for the broadest possible range of operations that include homeland defense, natural disasters, stabilization efforts, counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations, or nation state aggressors with growing sophistication and military means. The U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) faces the simultaneous requirements to recapitalize important capabilities and transform the force to meet the changing national security as articulated in the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review. All of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant competing national priorities including the economic crisis and healthcare reform. We anticipate that the national security environment will remain dynamic and challenging well into this decade trending with the threat environment. Government policies are impacting the defense environment including defense acquisition reform, more insourcing, concerns over industrial base, a shift in emphasis towards more affordable solutions and emphasis on increasing diplomatic efforts to expand and strengthen our alliances. Although the U.S. DoD budget has grown substantially over the past decade, we expect the total budget growth rate to level off over the next several years due to shifting priorities and budget pressures. The fiscal year 2010 discretionary budget request of $660 billion includes an Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget of $130 billion, with an additional $33 billion requested. The fiscal year 2011 discretionary budget of $708 billion includes OCO budget of $159 billion. Procurement is expected to increase, while Research and Development accounts decrease, facing increasing budgetary pressures due to growing requirements from Operations and Maintenance (O&M) and personnel costs tied to U.S. commitments overseas. However, this trend is partially offset by 28 Table of Contents equipment recapitalization efforts and continued demand for systems development. The near-term forecast of the defense budget environment shows limited growth in the 2011 to 2015 period for investment efforts. Though opportunities may exist following U.S. troop draw-downs in Iraq, they are offset by recent increases in Afghanistan. We continue to see pressure to reduce OCO requests that have been used to cover the ongoing costs of the wars. It is unlikely that the U.S. DoD will be able to fully fund all programs of record already in development as well as new initiatives. This imbalance between future costs of programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the U.S. DoD and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules, restructuring programs, and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding and occasionally by cancellation of programs. We expect the U.S. DoD will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies from acquisition reform and emphasizing utilization of commercial off-the-shelf solutions and network-enabled operations. These strategies will be enabled through persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), long-range strike, special operations, unmanned systems, cyber security, and precision-guided kinetic and non-kinetic weapons, electronic warfare, as well as selected outsourcing of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. Other nations continue to experience growing demands for new equipment to address operational requirements, aging inventories, and changing threat environments. Greater U.S. reliance on allies and coalition partners places additional pressure on nations to emphasize acquisition of material that is deployable, survivable, and interoperable with the international community. European nations are struggling to meet defense investment needs as budget deficits create greater pressure on resources. Though regional financial concerns exist, Middle Eastern military markets remain robust with stable oil prices and persistent regional security concerns sustaining continued defense investment. In Asia, growth is slowing with nations pursuing select acquisitions to address growing regional threats. The international market will continue to be affected by global economic challenges. However, the continuing threat environment should keep demand stable in 2010. Missile Defense Environment The proliferation of short- and medium-range ballistic missiles is considered the greatest current threat to security and is driving missile defense spending. As a result, the near-term focus for growth is in regional and tactical BMD systems. Civil Space Transportation and Exploration Environment The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) budget is focused on technology development and demonstration programs, the International Space Station, and new initiatives associated with space exploration. NASA is developing new approaches to space exploration with added emphasis on commercial spaceflight systems, space technology development and robotic missions. NASA is also enhancing its focus on climate change and aeronautics research. Homeland Security Environment The continuing threat from terrorism is the key driver for the homeland security market. Key growth areas include aviation security, border security, maritime security and cyber security. Additionally, the U.S. government is focused on increasing cooperation with state and local institutions. Commercial Satellite Environment The commercial satellite market is experiencing improvement in market demand, partly driven by strong U.S. government demand for commercial satellite systems and services, but the overall sector continues to be characterized by overcapacity creating strong competitive pressures on pricing. Adjacent Market Environment We see growth opportunities across a number of adjacent markets with both U.S. DoD and other U.S. government customers. These markets, including services, unmanned systems, intelligence, cyber, and energy, represent key development areas which support the current engagements overseas as well as emerging national security issues. 29 Table of Contents Services Growth in services is anticipated both domestically and internationally, as customers have a wide variety of needs, including information services, platform-related services, facility management, infrastructure services and logistics command and control. Unmanned Systems The unmanned market continues to see growth in all classes of platforms due to the high demand from the U.S. military in Southwest Asia. We anticipate this growth increasing as unmanned systems continue to provide critical mission functions to the war fighter with affordability, persistence, and accuracy. Intelligence We see the intelligence market growing based on the demands of data collection, dissemination, and analysis driven by the conflicts in Southwest Asia. Growth in data fusion, data management, and information sharing is expected as the use of ISR assets increase. Cyber The demand for defensive, offensive, and exploit operations in the emerging cyber market provides unique growth opportunities as explicit needs are further defined by customers. Cyber threats from both state and non-state actors represent a critical national security issue. The U.S. government is taking significant steps to mitigate the cyber threat to the U.S. DoD and to U.S. critical infrastructure. Energy We anticipate the energy market will emerge with growth potential. As energy volatility becomes more substantial, the need for energy management, infrastructure security, and scenario modeling will increase accordingly. The U.S. DoD, including individual service branches, is also actively engaged in developing energy policy guidance and comprehensive plans from which to execute programs. BDS Realignment Effective January 1, 2009, 2008 and 2007 certain programs were realigned among BDS segments. In addition, effective January 1, 2008, certain environmental remediation contracts (formerly included in N&SS) were transferred to the Other Segment. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. See Note 21. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Revenues $ 33,661 $ 32,047 $ 32,052 % of Total company revenues 49 % 53 % 48 % Earnings from operations $ 3,299 $ 3,232 $ 3,440 Operating margins 9.8 % 10.1 % 10.7 % Research and development $ 1,101 $ 933 $ 848 Contractual backlog $ 46,024 $ 45,285 $ 41,788 Unobligated backlog $ 18,815 $ 27,719 $ 29,893 Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. 30 Table of Contents Revenues BDS revenues increased by $1,614 million in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to higher revenues in GS&S and BMA, partially offset by decreases in N&SS. BDS revenues were unchanged in 2008 compared to 2007 as revenue growth in GS&S was offset by decreases in BMA and N&SS. Operating Earnings BDS operating earnings in 2009 increased by $67 million compared with 2008 primarily due to higher earnings in the BMA segment, partially offset by lower earnings in the N&SS segment. BDS earnings decreased by $208 million in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to lower earnings in the BMA segment resulting from a $248 million charge taken on the AEW&C program in the second quarter partially offset by higher earnings in the N&SS segment. Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog decreased 11% in 2009, from $73,004 million to $64,839 million, partly due to a partial termination for convenience from the U.S. Army of the BCTM (formerly FCS) System Development and Demonstration contract relating to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. Current year deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years also contributed to the backlog reduction. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished. Examples of these programs include Airborne Laser, EA-18G, Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals (FAB-T), BCTM (formerly FCS), GMD, Joint Tactical Radio System (JTRS), P-8A and Proprietary programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of these programs include AEW&C, International KC-767 Tanker, commercial and military satellites, Vigilare and High Frequency Modernisation. 31 Table of Contents Boeing Military Aircraft Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Revenues $ 14,057 $ 13,311 $ 13,499 % of Total company revenues 20 % 22 % 20 % Earnings from operations $ 1,513 $ 1,277 $ 1,607 Operating margins 10.8 % 9.6 % 11.9 % Research and development $ 541 $ 479 $ 445 Contractual backlog $ 26,311 $ 25,710 $ 22,974 Unobligated backlog $ 9,322 $ 10,048 $ 8,587 Revenues BMA revenues increased 6% in 2009 and decreased 1% in 2008. The increase of $746 million in 2009 was primarily due to higher deliveries and volume on the Apache, V-22 and Chinook rotorcraft programs and the F-18 and Proprietary programs, partly offset by lower volume on the F-22 and several weapons programs. The decrease of $188 million in 2008 is primarily driven by lower F-22, Apache, F-18 and Chinook revenue partially offset by increased deliveries on F-15 and International KC-767 Tanker and C-17 contract mix. Deliveries of new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 F/A-18 Models 49 45 44 F-15E Eagle 13 14 12 C-17 Globemaster 16 16 16 International KC-767 Tanker 2 2 CH-47 Chinook 11 12 10 T-45TS Goshawk 7 7 9 AH-64 Apache 23 3 17 C-40A Clipper 3 Total new-build production aircraft 121 99 111 Operating Earnings BMA operating earnings increased by $236 million in 2009 partly due to higher deliveries on several programs and volume, partially offset by a change in delivery mix. Operating earnings in both years were negatively impacted by charges on the AEW&C and International KC-767 Tanker programs. BMA earnings decreased by $330 million in 2008 primarily due to charges taken on the AEW&C program. Delivery mix and lower volume also contributed to the decrease in 2008. Research and Development The BMA segment continues to focus research and development resources to leverage customer knowledge, technical expertise and system integration of manned and unmanned systems that provide innovative solutions to meet the warfighter’s enduring needs. Research and development expense in 2009 increased by 13% over 2008 primarily due to proprietary programs which was partially offset by lower international tanker development costs. Research and development activities utilize our capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to enhance our customers’ capabilities in the areas of mobility, precision effects, situational awareness and survivability. Investments in prototyping allow us to offer low-risk programs to our customers. The products of our research and development support both new manned and unmanned systems as well as enhanced versions of existing fielded products. Investments support vertical integration of our product line in 32 Table of Contents areas like autonomous operation of unmanned vehicles, advanced sensors and Electronic Warfare. These efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness, interoperability, reliability and reducing the cost of ownership. Backlog BMA total backlog in 2009 was virtually unchanged from 2008. Backlog increases due to 2009 current year orders for C-17, P-8 India and Chinook aircraft were offset by revenues recognized on multi-year contracts received in prior years with the largest decrease in the F/A-18 program. Total backlog increased by 13% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to an increase in the V-22, Chinook and F-15 program backlog. These increases were partially offset by deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years with the largest decreases in the C-17 and F/A-18 programs. Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on BMA operations include the following: AEW&C During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded charges increasing the reach-forward losses on the AEW&C programs in Australia and Turkey by $133 million, $308 million and $81 million, respectively. The 2009 charge primarily related to delivery schedule delays. The 2008 charge, primarily related to our program in Australia, was due to subsystem development issues on the electronic warfare and ground support systems and the additional time required for integration testing. The AEW&C development program, also known as Wedgetail in Australia, Peace Eagle in Turkey and Peace Eye in the Republic of Korea, consists of 737-700 aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems, some of which have never been installed on an airplane before. Wedgetail includes six aircraft and Peace Eagle and Peace Eye include four aircraft each. During the fourth quarter of 2009, two Wedgetail aircraft were provided to Australia for familiarization and training. Wedgetail final delivery and customer acceptance is scheduled to begin in late 2010 and extend through the second quarter of 2011. These are advanced and complex fixed-price development programs involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability. We believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate; however, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be delayed. International KC-767 Tanker Program During 2009, 2008 and 2007, we recorded charges increasing the reach-forward losses in the International KC-767 Tanker programs by $78 million, $85 million and $152 million, respectively. The 2007 charge was partially offset at the consolidated level. The International KC-767 Tanker program includes four aircraft for the Italian Air Force and four aircraft for the Japanese Air Self Defense Force. The final delivery to Japan was made in December 2009. The Italian International KC-767 program is ongoing, and while we believe the revenue and cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of the program creates financial risk as additional completion and development costs may be necessary or remaining scheduled delivery dates could be delayed.

N&SS revenues are expected to decrease in 2010, primarily due to lower revenues on the BCTM and GMD programs. The decrease of $469 million in 2009 is primarily due to lower volume on the GMD, Intelligence and Security Systems, and Proprietary programs, partly offset by higher volume on several satellite programs. The decrease of $135 million in 2008 is primarily due to decreased revenues in BCTM (formerly FCS), Proprietary and satellite programs partially offset by increased revenues in the SBInet program. Delta launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Delta II Commercial 1 2 3 Delta IV Commercial 1 Satellites 6 1 4 Operating Earnings N&SS operating earnings decreased by $195 million in 2009 primarily due to lower revenues and charges related to the Sea Launch bankruptcy. Earnings in 2009 were also reduced by charges related to the settlement of a satellite contract dispute and indemnification of Delta II inventory. Earnings in 2008 included a favorable settlement on a civil satellite program. N&SS earnings increased by $171 million in 2008 primarily due to increased earnings from our investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA). N&SS operating earnings include equity earnings of $164 million, $178 million and $74 million from the United Space Alliance joint venture and the ULA joint venture in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. Research and Development The N&SS research and development funding remains focused on the development of communications, command and control, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems (C4ISR); that support a network-enabled architecture approach for our customers. We are investing in capabilities to enhance connectivity between existing and new air/ground and maritime platforms, to increase communications availability, utility and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and to leverage innovative networking and ISR concepts. Key programs in this area include BCTM, JTRS, Wideband Global Satellite System Ares, FAB-T and SBInet. Investments were also made to develop concepts and capabilities related to cyber and security products, as well as the development of next-generation space and intelligence systems. Along with increased funding to support these network-enabled capabilities, we also maintained our investment levels in missile defense, directed energy and advanced exploration systems. Backlog N&SS total backlog decreased by 34% in 2009 compared with 2008 partly due to the partial termination for convenience from the U.S. Army of the BCTM (formerly FCS) System Development and Demonstration contract related to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. Current year deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years including BCTM, 34 Table of Contents GMD, and Proprietary programs also contributed to the backlog reduction. Total backlog decreased by 12% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to revenues recognized on multi-year orders received in prior years on BCTM, GMD and C3 programs, partially offset by an increase in the International Space Station program. Additional Considerations Items which could have a future impact on N&SS operations include the following: United Launch Alliance On December 1, 2006, we and Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) created a 50/50 joint venture named United Launch Alliance L.L.C. ULA combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Atlas rockets. We initially contributed net assets of $914 million at December 1, 2006. The book value of our investment exceeded our proportionate share of ULA’s net assets. This difference is expensed ratably in future years. Based on the adjusted contributions and the conformed accounting policies established by ULA, this amortization is expected to be approximately $15 million annually for the next 15 years. In connection with the formation of ULA, we and Lockheed each have agreed to extend a line of credit to ULA of up to $200 million to support its working capital requirements during the 5 year period following December 1, 2006. We and Lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain U.S. government contracts to ULA as of the closing date. We and Lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the U.S. government. We and Lockheed have also each committed to provide ULA with up to $122 million of additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. See Note 7. We agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 million of Boeing Delta inventories included in contributed assets plus $1,860 million of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,111 million of inventories that were contributed by us and has made payments of $120 million to us under the inventory supply agreement. As part of its integration, ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program beyond what is currently on contract. In the event ULA is unable to sell additional Delta II inventory, earnings could be reduced by up to $62 million. We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value for two of the four satellite missions covered by the indemnification. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim and in June 2009, ULA filed an appeal. During 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. ULA intends to submit a claim to the USAF in 2010 to re-price the contract value of the third mission. If ULA is unsuccessful obtaining additional pricing we may be responsible for some of the shortfall and may record up to $382 million in pre-tax losses associated with the four missions. Business Environment and Trends During 2009, we received a partial termination for convenience from the U.S. Army of the BCTM (formerly FCS) System Development and Demonstration contract relating to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. We believe the final restructured BCTM contract will negatively impact revenue and earnings in the N&SS segment going forward. In addition, we completed the TSAT risk reduction and system definition contract in July 2009 and do not anticipate a future TSAT space segment program competition. As a result of lower than anticipated revenue and earnings, we tested N&SS goodwill for impairment during 2009. No 35 Table of Contents impairment was indicated by our tests. Future recommended budgetary changes, if approved by Congress, or additional partial terminations, could further impact N&SS programs, including the recoverability of goodwill.

Global Services & Support Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Revenues $ 8,727 $ 7,390 $ 7,072 % of Total company revenues 13 % 12 % 11 % Earnings from operations $ 947 $ 921 $ 970 Operating margins 10.9 % 12.5 % 13.7 % Research and development $ 163 $ 156 $ 114 Contractual backlog $ 11,967 $ 10,707 $ 9,607 Unobligated backlog $ 306 $ 690 $ 1,172 Revenues GS&S revenues increased $1,337 million in 2009 and $318 million in 2008, an increase of 18% and 4%. The 2009 increase was due to increased volume in the Integrated Logistics (IL), and the Training Systems and Services (TS&S) divisions. The 2008 increase was due to higher revenues in the TS&S and IL divisions partially offset by decreases in International Support program volume. Operating Earnings GS&S Operating earnings increased 3% in 2009 as additional earnings from increased volume were partially offset by lower margins due to contract adjustments and changes in contract mix. Operating earnings decreased by 5% in 2008 due to changes in the contract mix and disposition of contract matters. Research and Development GS&S continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including IL, Maintenance Modifications and Upgrades (MM&U) and TS&S, as well as on moving into new market areas of Logistics Command and Control (Log C2) and Energy Management in Advanced Global Services and Support. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Examples of successful programs stemming from these investment strategies include the C-17 Globemaster Sustainment Partnership, the F/A-18 Integrated Readiness Support Teaming program, the F-15 Singapore Performance-Based Logistics contract, and Smart Grid Projects. Successful development of adaptable systems has allowed GS&S to transition from Boeing platforms and into the broader aviation market. Beyond aerospace, GS&S capabilities have created opportunities in adjacencies and new markets exemplified in 2009 through entrance into the Land Vehicle support, Energy Solutions, and Logistics Information Systems markets. Backlog GS&S total backlog increased by 8% in 2009 compared with 2008 due to significant growth in International Support and Defense and Government Services programs and partially offset by decreases in the IL and MM&U divisions. Total backlog increased 6% in 2008 compared with 2007 primarily due to increases in IL and International Support programs. 36 Table of Contents Boeing Capital Corporation Business Environment and Trends BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 totaled $5,666 million, which was substantially collateralized by Boeing produced commercial aircraft. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is concentrated among U.S. commercial airline customers. The weak global economic environment and capital market disruptions affected the availability of credit for the airline industry. While sources of financing available for aircraft deliveries improved during 2009, BCC provided limited financing to certain Boeing customers. To the extent capital market conditions continue to improve, we believe the overall aircraft financing market should improve as well and lessen the need for BCC to provide financing. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,400 western-built commercial jet aircraft (11.6% of current world fleet) were parked as of December 2009, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Over 36% of the parked aircraft are not expected to return to service. In December 2008 and 2007, 11.0% and 8.2% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Revenues $ 660 $ 703 $ 815 Earnings from operations $ 126 $ 162 $ 234 Operating margins 19 % 23 % 29 % Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes. BCC’s revenues decreased $43 million in 2009, resulting from lower operating lease income resulting from a smaller portfolio of equipment under operating leases as a result of aircraft returns and asset dispositions. BCC’s revenues decreased $112 million in 2008, primarily due to lower interest income on notes receivable and lower investment income. Earnings From Operations BCC’s operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings decreased by $36 million in 2009 primarily due to lower revenues, higher impairment expense and a provision for losses primarily due to declines in aircraft collateral values and reduced projected cash flows for certain aircraft. The decrease in operating earnings in 2008 compared with 2007 was primarily due to lower revenues. 37 Table of Contents Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31,: (Dollars in millions) 2009 2008 BCC Customer Financing and Investment Portfolio $ 5,666 $ 6,023 Valuation Allowance as a % of Total Receivables 2.5 % 2.1 % Debt $ 4,075 $ 3,652 Debt-to-Equity Ratio 5.8-to-1 5.0-to-1 BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2009 decreased from December 31, 2008 due to normal portfolio run-off partially offset by new business volume. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, BCC had $385 million and $685 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, of which $345 million and $305 million had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. In March 2009, Mexicana Group committed to lease 25 717 aircraft, including 13 that were placed on lease and 12 that were held for sale or re-lease at December 31, 2009. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $171 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2010. These aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and approximately $15 million of such aircraft had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts at December 31, 2009. BCC enters into certain transactions with the Other segment in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies. Restructurings and Restructuring Requests From time to time, certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. As of December 31, 2009, BCC has not reached agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. Other Segment (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Revenues $ 165 $ 567 $ 308 Loss from operations $ (152 ) $ (307 ) $ (331 ) Effective January 1, 2008, certain intercompany items were realigned between the Other segment and Unallocated expense. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. Other segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $402 million compared with 2008 primarily due to the sale of three C-17 aircraft in 2008 held under operating lease. Other segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $155 million primarily due to recognition of pre-tax expense of $82 million in the prior year to increase the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables related to lower U.S. airline customer credit ratings. During 2009, Other segment recognized $76 million in lower charges relating to environmental remediation than in 2008. Other segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $259 million compared with 2007 primarily due to the sale of four C-17 aircraft held under operating lease, three of which were sold in 2008. Other segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2008 decreased by $24 million compared with 2007 primarily due to $50 million in lower environmental and certain other charges offset by the recognition of a provision for losses of $82 million related to lower U.S. airline customer credit ratings. The provision for losses amount has been recorded in the Other segment as a result of intercompany guarantees we provide to BCC. 38 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 Net earnings $ 1,312 $ 2,672 $ 4,074 Non-cash items 2,381 1,829 1,753 Changes in working capital 1,910 (4,902 ) 3,757 Net cash provided/(used) by operating activities 5,603 (401 ) 9,584 Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities (3,794 ) 1,888 (3,822 ) Net cash provided/(used) by financing activities 4,094 (5,202 ) (4,884 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 44 (59 ) 46 Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 5,947 (3,774 ) 924 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 3,268 7,042 6,118 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 9,215 $ 3,268 $ 7,042 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $6,004 million to $5,603 million during 2009 compared with 2008. The improvement reflects a reduction in working capital due to the inventory that was built up during the 2008 IAM strike which was delivered in 2009, offset by the continued ramp up of the 787 program during 2009. We expect operating cash flows to be lower in 2010 as we continue to build inventories prior to deliveries of the 787 and 747-8 airplanes. We contributed 29,211,295 shares of our common stock with an aggregate value of $1.5 billion to our pension plans in November 2009. Cash contributions to our pension plans totaled $82 million and $531 million in 2009 and 2008. Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities totaled $3,794 million during 2009 compared with $1,888 million provided during 2008. The $5,682 million year-over-year change is primarily due to changes in investments in time deposits and debt securities. In 2008 we received net proceeds of $4,670 million from liquidating investments. In 2009, we made net contributions of $1,588 million to investments. In 2009, other investing outlays included $639 million for acquisitions and $448 million to satisfy guarantees of Sea Launch indebtedness, which was partially offset by a $40 million reimbursement. These cash outlays were partly offset by $488 million of lower capital spending on property, plant and equipment additions in 2009 compared with 2008. We expect capital spending in 2010 to be higher than 2009 due to the construction of a second 787 final assembly line in North Charleston, South Carolina. Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities totaled $4,094 million during 2009 compared with $5,202 million used during 2008, primarily due to proceeds from borrowings of $5,961 million in 2009 and reductions in share repurchases in 2009. On March 13, 2009, we issued notes totaling $1,850 million, on July 28, 2009, we issued notes totaling $1,950 million, and on November 20, 2009, we issued notes totaling $1,200 million. On October 27, 2009, BCC issued notes totaling $1,000 million. In 2009, we repaid $551 million of debt, including $528 million of debt held at BCC. In 2008, we repaid $738 million of debt, including $709 million of debt held at BCC. In 2007, we repaid $1,406 million of debt, including $1,309 million of debt held at BCC. There were no material debt issuances during 2008 or 2007. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the recorded balance of debt was $12,924 million and $7,512 million, of which $707 million and $560 million were classified as short-term. This includes $4,075 million and $3,652 million of debt recorded at BCC, of which $659 million and $528 million was classified as short-term. 39 Table of Contents During 2009, we repurchased 1,173,152 shares at an average price of $42.94 in our open market share repurchase program and 477,176 shares transferred to us from employees in satisfaction of minimum tax withholding obligations associated with the vesting of restricted stock during the period. During 2008, we repurchased 42,073,885 shares at an average price of $69.79 in our open market share repurchase program, 1,462,776 shares at an average price of $64.95 as part of the ShareValue Trust distribution, and 74,824 shares in stock swaps. During 2007, we repurchased 28,995,599 shares at an average price of $95.68 in our open market share repurchase program and 28,432 shares in stock swaps. Share repurchase activity is expected to remain at a minimal level in 2010. Credit Ratings Our credit ratings are summarized below: Fitch Moody’s Standard &Poor’s Long-term: Boeing/BCC A+ A2 A Outlook Negative Negative Stable Short-term: Boeing/BCC F1 P-1 A-1 On April 30, 2009, Fitch Ratings affirmed Boeing’s and BCC’s A+ credit rating but changed its outlook from stable to negative. On July 29, 2009, Standard & Poor’s lowered Boeing’s and BCC’s long-term ratings from A+ to A. On October 14, 2009, Moody’s affirmed Boeing’s and BCC’s A2 and P-1 ratings, but changed its outlook from neutral to negative. Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants. We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2009 and at December 31, 2009, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $3,525 million ($1,500 million exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements, of which $2,000 million is a 5-year credit facility expiring in November 2012 and $1,525 million is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in November 2010. Both the 5-year and 364-day credit facilities have a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration dates. In 2009, we renewed the 364-day revolving credit facility, of which $500 million is allocated to BCC. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support possible commercial paper borrowings in 2010. On March 9, 2009, we filed a public shelf registration with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of debt securities and common stock. In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. At this point in time, our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment, and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future. There can be no assurance, however, that the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by capital market conditions. On November 9, 2009, we made pension contributions in the form of 29,211,295 shares of our common stock. The contributed shares had an aggregate value of $1.5 billion, as of the contribution 40 Table of Contents date. The share contribution did not affect cash balances. In addition, we made cash contributions of $82 million during 2009. In 2010, we will begin matching employee contributions to the company-sponsored 401(k) plan with common stock instead of cash for nonunion employees. At December 31, 2009 and 2008 our pension plans were $6,356 million and $8,420 million underfunded as measured under GAAP. In 2010, required contributions to our pension plans are not expected to exceed $100 million. As of December 31, 2009, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2009, and the estimated timing thereof. (Dollars in millions) Total Less than1 year 1-3years 3-5years After 5years Long-term debt (including current portion) $ 12,846 $ 680 $ 2,815 $ 2,547 $ 6,804 Interest on debt* 7,981 664 1,204 934 5,179 Pension and other postretirement cash requirements 22,038 634 1,484 5,304 14,616 Capital lease obligations 76 14 28 22 12 Operating lease obligations 1,158 213 300 188 457 Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 100,496 35,387 29,070 20,821 15,218 Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 11,793 10,893 765 131 4 Total contractual obligations $ 156,388 $ 48,485 $ 35,666 $ 29,947 $ 42,290 * Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2009. Variable rate debt was approximately 1% of our total debt at December 31, 2009. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. In addition, the agreements are not cancelable without substantial penalty. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Approximately 9% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, 41 Table of Contents property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2009, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2009, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $11 billion that extend through 2024. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2009, our total liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $1,009 million, of which $182 million we expect to pay in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $827 million. Our income tax obligations are excluded from the table above. See Note 5. Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2009. (Dollars in millions) Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3 years 4-5 years After 5years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $ 7,052 $ 5,944 $ 770 $ 3 $ 335 Commercial aircraft financing commitments 10,409 1,873 1,313 2,753 4,470 Total commercial commitments $ 17,461 $ 7,817 $ 2,083 $ 2,756 $ 4,805 42 Table of Contents Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we currently do not anticipate that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers; however there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 11. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20, including our contesting the default termination of the A-12 aircraft, litigation/arbitration involving BSSI programs and employment and benefits litigation brought by several of our employees. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $706 million at December 31, 2009. For additional information, see Note 11. Income Taxes We have recorded a net liability of $1,787 million at December 31, 2009 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of these contingencies, see Note 5. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, length of time and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contract’s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. 43 Table of Contents Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2009 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $337 million. A number of our contracts are in a reach–forward loss position. Changes to estimated loss in future periods are recorded immediately in earnings. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs, excluding the 747 program, for all of 2009 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $275 million. The 747 program is in a reach-forward loss position. Absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs, subsequent deliveries are 44 Table of Contents recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately. Aircraft Valuation Allowance for Losses on Customer Financing Receivables The allowance for losses on customer financing receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of customer financing receivables in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the customer financing receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings, collateral values and default rates. If each customer’s credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at December 31, 2009, the allowance would have decreased by $142 million or increased by $308 million. If the collateral values were 10% higher or lower at December 31, 2009, the allowance would have decreased by $56 million or increased by $54 million. If the cumulative default rates used for each rating category should increase or decrease 1%, the allowance would have increased by $6 million or decreased by $6 million. Impairment Review for Assets Under Operating Leases and Held for Re-Lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $8 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. Lease Residual Values Equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease. If the estimated residual values declined 10% at December 31, 2009, this would result in a future cumulative pre-tax earnings impact of approximately $180 million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods, of which approximately $45 million would be recognized in 2010. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. April 1 is our annual testing date. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the 45 Table of Contents amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. Changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill. As of December 31, 2009 and 2008, we had $499 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would have no impact on the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets. Postretirement Plans Substantially all our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans. We also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements require several assumptions. Significant assumptions include the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligations and Shareholders’ equity. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2009. (dollars in millions) Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bps Pension plans Projected benefit obligation $ (1,478 ) $ 1,817 Net periodic pension cost (166 ) 189 Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (163 ) 192 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost (12 ) 14 46 Table of Contents Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2009 net periodic pension expense by $117 million. Differences between actual and expected returns can affect future year’s pension cost. The asset balance used to calculate the expected return on pension plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of assets over a five year period. Despite investment gains during 2009, the significant losses incurred during 2008 will cause net periodic pension cost for 2010 to increase by approximately $100 million due to amortization of actuarial losses. Absent a recovery of asset values or higher interest rates or higher contributions, net periodic pension expense will increase further in future years. The assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following year’s expense, recorded liabilities and Shareholders’ Equity. In the following table, we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change as of December 31, 2009. (dollars in millions) Change in medical trend rateIncrease 100 bps Change in medical trend rateDecrease 100 bps Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation $ 617 $ (541 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost 119 (104 ) 47 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Exposure to this risk is managed by generally matching the profile of BCC’s liabilities with that of BCC’s assets in relation to amount and terms such as expected maturities and fixed versus floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2009, the impact to BCC’s pre-tax earnings of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained rise in interest rates would be insignificant for the year ended December 31, 2010. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our investments or customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. Based on the portfolio of other Boeing fixed-rate debt, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material. The investors in the fixed-rate debt obligations that we issue do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2009, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by $136 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by $150 million. At December 31, 2008, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency forward and option contracts would have decreased our unrealized losses by $70 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have decreased our unrealized losses by $196 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. 48 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:34.591026
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in many countries and rely extensively on a network of partners, key suppliers and subcontractors around the world. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes and Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Commercial Airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets often offset. BCC delivers value by supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure. Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Commercial Airplanes $ 31,834 $ 34,051 $ 28,263 Boeing Defense, Space & Security 31,943 33,661 32,047 Boeing Capital Corporation 639 660 703 Other segment 138 165 567 Unallocated items and eliminations (248 ) (256 ) (671 ) Total $ 64,306 $ 68,281 $ 60,909 Revenues in 2010 decreased by $3,975 million or 6% compared with 2009. Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $2,217 million due to lower 777 deliveries primarily resulting from a production rate change from 7 to 5 per month beginning in June 2010 and no deliveries on the 747 program due to the transition from the 747-400 to the 747-8. These were partially offset by increases in commercial aviation services business. BDS revenues decreased by $1,718 million primarily due to lower revenues in the Network & Space Systems (N&SS) segment. Revenues in 2009 increased by $7,372 million compared with 2008 due to higher revenues in Commercial Airplanes and BDS. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $5,788 million, primarily due to higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2009. Deliveries in 2008 were lower as a result of a 18 Table of Contents labor strike in 2008. Increases were partially offset by decreases in commercial aviation services and intercompany revenues. BDS revenues increased by $1,614 million, primarily due to higher revenues in Global Services & Support (GS&S) and Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA), partially offset by lower revenues in N&SS. BCC revenues decreased by $43 million during the year primarily due to a decrease in the customer financing portfolio. Other segment revenues decreased by $402 million partly due to higher revenues in 2008 from the sale of four C-17 aircraft held under operating lease. Lower Unallocated items and eliminations improved revenues by $415 million primarily due to lower P-8A Poseidon intercompany revenues recognized by Commercial Airplanes in 2009 compared with 2008. Earnings From Operations The following table summarizes our earnings/(loss) from operations: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Commercial Airplanes $ 3,006 $ (583 ) $ 1,186 Boeing Defense, Space & Security 2,875 3,299 3,232 Boeing Capital Corporation 152 126 162 Other segment (327 ) (152 ) (307 ) Unallocated items and eliminations (735 ) (594 ) (323 ) Total $ 4,971 $ 2,096 $ 3,950 Operating earnings in 2010 increased by $2,875 million compared with 2009. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $3,589 million, primarily due to $2,693 million of costs related to the first three 787 flight test aircraft included in research and development expense in 2009 and the 2009 reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,352 million. BDS earnings decreased by $424 million compared with 2009 due to lower revenues and margins in the BMA segment and lower revenues in the N&SS segment. Other segment earnings decreased by $175 million primarily due to $119 million in intercompany guarantees related to aircraft impairment charges and reduced aircraft collateral values. Operating earnings in 2009 decreased by $1,854 million compared with 2008. Commercial Airplanes earnings decreased by $1,769 million primarily due to $2,693 million of costs related to the first three 787 flight test aircraft included in research and development expense as a result of our determination in August 2009 that these aircraft could not be sold. The earnings decrease is also attributable to $1,352 million in reach-forward losses on the 747 program in 2009, compared with $667 million in 2008. Lower commercial aviation services and intercompany earnings also contributed to lower 2009 earnings. These decreases were partially offset by higher commercial airplane deliveries in 2009 compared with 2008. BDS earnings increased by $67 million compared with 2008 primarily due to higher earnings in the BMA segment partially offset by lower earnings in the N&SS segment. Other segment losses decreased by $155 million primarily due to recognition of pre-tax expense of $82 million in the prior year to increase the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables and lower environmental remediation charges compared with the prior year. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2009 reduced earnings by $271 million compared with 2008, which is further explained in the table below. 19 Table of Contents The most significant items included in Unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Share-based plans $ (136 ) $ (189 ) $ (149 ) Deferred compensation (112 ) (158 ) 223 Pension 54 110 (208 ) Postretirement (59 ) (93 ) (79 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations (482 ) (264 ) (110 ) Total $ (735 ) $ (594 ) $ (323 ) Share-based plans expense decreased in 2010 by $53 million primarily due to the expiration of the ShareValue trust at June 30, 2010. Deferred compensation expense decreased by $46 million in 2010 and increased by $381 million in 2009. The year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions. Other unallocated items and eliminations expense increased by $218 million in 2010 primarily due to timing of intercompany expense allocations and elimination of profit on intercompany items as well as a $55 million charitable contribution. The 2009 increase of $154 million was primarily due to timing of intercompany expense allocations, elimination of profit on intercompany items and a more favorable insurance adjustment. Unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of $1,864 million, $1,816 million and $1,132 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period. A portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense. Earnings from operations included the following amounts allocated to business segments and Other unallocated items and eliminations. (Dollars in millions) Pension Other PostretirementBenefits Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2010 2009 2008 Allocated to business segments $ (1,155 ) $ (989 ) $ (488 ) $ (421 ) $ (522 ) $ (428 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations 54 110 (208 ) (59 ) (93 ) (79 ) Total $ (1,101 ) $ (879 ) $ (696 ) $ (480 ) $ (615 ) $ (507 ) 20 Table of Contents Other Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Earnings from operations $ 4,971 $ 2,096 $ 3,950 Other income/(expense), net 52 (26 ) 247 Interest and debt expense (516 ) (339 ) (202 ) Earnings before income taxes 4,507 1,731 3,995 Income tax expense (1,196 ) (396 ) (1,341 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $ 3,311 $ 1,335 $ 2,654 Other income increased by $78 million in 2010 primarily due to investment income on higher cash and investment balances throughout 2010. The decrease in 2009 of $273 million was driven by lower investment income due to both lower interest rates and investment balances. Interest and debt expense increased by $177 million and $137 million in 2010 and 2009 due to debt issued in 2009. Our effective income tax rate was 26.5%, 22.9% and 33.6% for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our effective tax rate was higher in 2010, compared with 2009, primarily because pre-tax book income in 2010 was higher than in 2009 and because of an income tax charge of $150 million recorded during the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. This was partially offset by a tax benefit of $371 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of settling the 1998-2003 federal audit. Our effective tax rate was lower in 2009, compared with 2008, primarily because tax credits, such as research and development credits, represented a higher proportion of earnings before taxes due to the year-over-year reduction in earnings. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 2008 Contractual Backlog: Commercial Airplanes $ 255,591 $ 250,476 $ 278,575 Boeing Defense, Space & Security: Boeing Military Aircraft 25,094 26,354 25,802 Network & Space Systems 9,586 7,746 8,868 Global Services & Support 13,684 11,924 10,615 Total Boeing Defense, Space & Security 48,364 46,024 45,285 Total contractual backlog $ 303,955 $ 296,500 $ 323,860 Unobligated backlog $ 16,871 $ 19,058 $ 28,066 Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2010 was due to orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation, partially reduced by cancellations of orders. The decrease in backlog during 2009 was due to deliveries in excess of orders, changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders. 21 Table of Contents Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2010 is due to decreases at BDS of $1,993 million compared with 2009 primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts including the V-22, Brigade Combat Team Modernization (BCTM) and Chinook programs, partially offset by multi-year procurement contract awards on the F/A-18 and International Space Station programs. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2009 is primarily due to decreases at BDS of $8,904 million compared with 2008 partly due to a partial termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the BCTM System Development and Demonstration contract relating to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. Approved funding of existing multi-year contracts including the BCTM, V-22, Chinook, Proprietary and GMD programs also reduced unobligated backlog. Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Global passenger traffic exceeded initial expectations in 2010 growing an estimated 8% for the year and showing growth over prior 2008 peak levels. Significant variation existed between regions and airline business models with emerging markets and low cost carriers leading recovery and growth into 2011. Air cargo traffic also rebounded in 2010 after two years of contraction. Led by strong growth in Asian exports, air cargo traffic recovered to peak 2007 levels and is poised to resume growth in 2011. Airlines cut capacity in 2009 to match the demand environment which allowed them to boost yields as demand recovered in 2010. Airlines have also pursued new revenue sources by expanding alliances and building ancillary revenue streams. In addition, airlines continued to focus on cutting costs and pursued consolidation opportunities, particularly in mature markets, to improve market positioning. These airline tactics, combined with improving demand and relatively stable fuel prices, have driven a strong turnaround in airline industry profitability. Airlines are forecast to earn $15 billion in 2010 following a $10 billion net loss in 2009. The 2011 outlook is for continued profitability which should allow airlines to rebuild balance sheets that suffered from fuel price spikes and recession in 2008-2009. The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% per year for passenger and cargo traffic based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $3.6 trillion market for 30,900 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, disease outbreaks (such as avian or H1N1 flu), terrorism, conflicts and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. We expect the existing long-term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide (measured in real terms) to continue into the foreseeable future. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has enabled low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. 22 Table of Contents Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 10% of Commercial Airplanes’ contractual backlog in dollar terms is with U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are likely to enter the 70 to 190 seat aircraft market over the next few years. Many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided support, including ""launch aid,"" which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables planes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies as experienced in 2010 impacted competitors’ revenues and profits. Competitors routinely respond to relatively weaker dollars by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. Airbus has announced such initiatives targeting overhead cost savings, a reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity through 2012. If the U.S. dollar strengthens again, Airbus can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Revenues $ 31,834 $ 34,051 $ 28,263 % of Total company revenues 50 % 50 % 46 % Earnings/(loss) from operations $ 3,006 $ (583 ) $ 1,186 Operating margins 9.4 % -1.7 % 4.2 % Research and development $ 2,975 $ 5,383 $ 2,838 Contractual backlog $ 255,591 $ 250,476 $ 278,575 23 Table of Contents Revenues Year-over-year changes in Revenue are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) 2010vs. 2009 2009vs. 2008 New airplane sales $ (2,733 ) $ 6,129 Commercial aviation services business 569 (308 ) Other (53 ) (33 ) Total $ (2,217 ) $ 5,788 Revenues for 2010 decreased by $2,217 million or 6.5% compared with 2009. The decrease in new airplane revenues primarily reflects lower 777 deliveries resulting from a production rate change from 7 to 5 per month beginning in June 2010 and no deliveries on the 747 program due to the transition from the 747-400 to the 747-8 derivative. The increase in revenues from commercial aviation services business was primarily due to increased sales of spares. The increase in revenue of $5,788 million in 2009 from 2008 was primarily attributable to higher new airplane deliveries partially offset by lower intercompany revenues. 2008 revenues were negatively impacted by a 2008 IAM strike. The decrease in revenues from commercial aviation services business was driven by economic conditions. Commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: 737 747 767 777 Total 2010 Cumulative Deliveries 3,504 1,418 994 910 Deliveries 376 (1) 12 74 462 2009 Cumulative Deliveries 3,128 1,418 982 836 Deliveries 372 (1) 8 13 88 481 2008 Cumulative Deliveries 2,756 1,410 969 748 Deliveries 290 (1) 14 10 (1) 61 375 (1) Includes intercompany deliveries of 5 737 aircraft in 2010, 5 737 aircraft in 2009 and 2 767 aircraft and 2 737 aircraft in 2008. Earnings From Operations Earnings from operations for 2010 increased by $3,589 million compared with 2009. The increase was primarily due to the 2009 reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of costs related to the first three 787 flight test aircraft, and the 2009 reach-forward losses on the 747 program. Costs of $2,693 million included in research and development expense in 2009 for the first three flight test 787 airplanes were a result of our determination that these aircraft could not be sold. The reach-forward loss on the 747 program of $1,352 million during 2009 was primarily due to increased production costs, reductions in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and the difficult market conditions affecting the 747-8. The remaining net decrease in earnings for 2010 was primarily attributable to increased research and development expense of $285 million and lower new airplane deliveries. 24 Table of Contents Earnings from operations for 2009 decreased by $1,769 million compared with 2008, primarily due to the reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of the three 787 flight test aircraft previously recorded as inventory, partially offset by a $148 million decrease in other research and development expense. The decrease in earnings is also attributable to $1,352 million in reach-forward losses on the 747 program in 2009, compared with $685 million in 2008. Lower commercial aviation services revenues and margins reduced earnings by $245 million. Higher infrastructure cost allocations related to the 787 and 747-8 schedule delays announced in 2008 and 2009 and infrastructure costs incurred during the 2008 IAM strike reduced earnings by $199 million. Increased period and other costs reduced earnings by $47 million. These decreases were partially offset by increased earnings of $1,934 million related to new airplane deliveries. Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before Boeing and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. The increase in contractual backlog during 2010 was due to orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation, partially reduced by cancellations of orders. The decrease in backlog during 2009 was due to deliveries in excess of orders, changes in projected revenue escalation and cancellations of orders. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. Commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs, a portion of which does not vary with production rates. As the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity increases, the average cost of the accounting quantity also increases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates. This has the effect of decreasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. 25 Table of Contents The table below provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. Program 737 747 767 777 787 2010 Program accounting quantities 5,000 1,524 1,048 1,150 * Undelivered units under firm orders 2,186 107 50 253 847 Cumulative firm orders 5,690 1,525 1,044 1,163 847 2009 Program accounting quantities 4,600 1,499 1,035 1,100 * Undelivered units under firm orders 2,076 108 59 281 851 Cumulative firm orders 5,204 1,526 1,041 1,117 851 2008 Program accounting quantities 4,200 1,499 1,023 1,050 * Undelivered units under firm orders 2,270 114 70 350 910 Cumulative firm orders 5,026 1,524 1,039 1,098 910 * A final determination of the initial accounting quantity for the 787 program will be made in the quarter of first airplane delivery, targeted for the third quarter of 2011. 737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 400 units during 2010. During 2010, we announced plans to increase monthly production of the 737 from 31.5 to 35 airplanes per month beginning in the first quarter of 2012 and a further increase to 38 airplanes per month beginning in the second quarter of 2013. 747 Program The accounting quantity for the 747 program increased by 25 units during 2010. During 2009 and 2008, we recorded charges of $1,352 million and $685 million to recognize reach-forward losses on the 747 program reflecting higher than anticipated costs, a reduction in delivery price increases associated with escalation and difficult cargo market conditions which caused us to defer a planned production rate increase for 747-8. First flight of the 747-8 Freighter occurred on February 8, 2010. A fourth aircraft was added to the flight test program in July 2010 to improve flight test efficiency. On September 30, 2010, we announced that the expected first delivery of the 747-8 Freighter would move to the middle of 2011 from the fourth quarter of 2010 and a fifth airplane would be added to the flight test fleet to support the new schedule. The new delivery schedule followed an assessment of the expected cumulative impact of flight test discoveries, which include a low frequency vibration in certain flight conditions and an underperforming aileron actuator. While neither issue required structural changes to the airplane, they led to disruptions to certification testing, which the program was unable to offset within the prior schedule. We are currently producing 747-8 airplanes and until completion of our flight test program, there is risk that additional items may be identified that require further modifications or other changes to those aircraft we have produced. On March 19, 2010, we announced that we will accelerate, from mid-2013 to mid-2012, a planned production rate increase from 1.5 to 2 airplanes per month. Certification and first delivery of the Intercontinental passenger derivative is expected in the fourth quarter of 2011. Schedule and other risks inherent in the demanding flight test and certification phases of program development remain. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 13 units during 2010. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2010. In April 2009, we announced that monthly production of the 777 will decline from 7 to 5 airplanes per month 26 Table of Contents beginning in June 2010. In March 2010, we announced that we will accelerate by approximately six months, from early 2012 to mid-2011, a planned production rate increase to 7 airplanes per month. In December 2010, we announced that monthly production of the 777 will increase from 7 to 8.3 airplanes per month in the first quarter 2013. 787 Program First flight of the 787 occurred on December 15, 2009 and flight testing for certification continued during 2010. Flight testing involves six flight test aircraft and a limited amount of testing on two production-configured airplanes prior to first delivery. On August 27, 2010, we announced that the expected date of first delivery of the 787 had been moved to mid-first quarter 2011 from the fourth quarter of 2010. This schedule revision followed an assessment of the cumulative impact of a number of issues, including supplier workmanship issues related to the horizontal stabilizer, instrumentation delays and the expected availability date of an engine needed to support the final phases of flight test. On November 9, 2010, a flight test aircraft lost primary electrical power as a result of an onboard fire. Back-up systems functioned as expected allowing the crew to complete a safe landing. Flight testing was suspended pending investigation. On November 24, 2010, we announced minor design changes to power distribution panels and updates to systems software resulting from the investigation. On December 23, 2010, we resumed Boeing flight test activities and on January 17, 2011 resumed certification testing. On January 18, 2011, we announced that the expected date of first delivery had been moved to the third quarter of 2011 due to the flight testing and certification delays. A number of engineering and other design changes have been identified in conjunction with the flight test program that are being incorporated into our production system and on aircraft already completed. During 2010, we continued to produce 787 airplanes and until completion of our flight test program, there is risk that additional items will be identified that require further modifications or other changes to those aircraft we have produced. We continue to monitor and address challenges associated with assembly of initial airplanes including management of our extended global supply chain, incorporation of design changes into aircraft in various stages of assembly, completion and integration of traveled work as well as weight and systems integration. For example, during the second quarter of 2010 we delayed some 787 component deliveries to reduce out of sequence work moving into final assembly at our Everett factory and improve supply chain efficiency. We continue to work toward planned increases in 787 production rates as well as the timely introduction of the 787-9 derivative. Such efforts include the construction of a second assembly line in North Charleston, South Carolina and establishing transitional surge capacity at our Everett, Washington location. On July 1, 2010, we completed firm configuration of the 787-9 airplane with first delivery scheduled for late 2013. We continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes, including delivery delays and supplier assertions. Efforts continue to ensure we remain focused on satisfying customer mission and performance needs in light of the anticipated weight of their respective aircraft. A number of our customers have contractual remedies for schedule delays and/or performance. We continue to address customer and supplier claims and requests for other contractual relief as brought forth. During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with these aircraft were included in research and development expense. We believe that the other three 787 flight test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to those aircraft in program inventory at December 31, 2010. If we determine that one or more of the other flight test aircraft cannot be sold, we may incur additional charges. 27 Table of Contents Our current assessment is that the program is not in a reach-forward loss position, however the cumulative impacts of the production challenges, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts have created significant pressure on program profitability and we expect to record zero margin on our initial deliveries. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to address this pressure. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. These costs are expected to increase with 787 and 747-8 entry into service. Research and Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned certification/initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Our Research and development expense decreased by $2,408 million in 2010. This was primarily due to the reclassification to research and development expense of $2,693 million of production costs related to the three 787 flight test aircraft in 2009, partially offset by a $285 million increase of other research and development expense. Our Research and development expense increased by $2,545 million in 2009. This was due to the 2009 reclassification of production costs related to the three 787 flight test aircraft and $50 million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments, partially offset by a $198 million decrease of other research and development expense. Additional Considerations The 787 and 747-8 programs highlight the risks inherent in new airplane programs and new derivative airplanes, particularly as both the 747-8 Freighter and the 787-8 continue the demanding flight test and certification phases of program development. Development also continues on the 787-9 and 747-8 Intercontinental. Costs related to development of new programs and derivative airplanes are expensed as incurred. Costs to produce new aircraft are included in inventory and accounted for using program accounting. Airplane programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated production costs exceed our estimated program revenues for the accounting quantity. Generally commercial airplanes are sold on a firm fixed-price basis with an indexed price escalation clause and are often sold several years before scheduled delivery. Each customer purchase agreement contains an escalation clause to account for the effects of economic fluctuations over the period of time from airplane sale to airplane delivery. A price escalation formula based on pre-defined factors is used to determine the final price of 28 Table of Contents the airplane at the time of customer delivery. While firm fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. Many new airplanes and derivatives have highly complex designs, utilize exotic materials and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners. As technical or quality issues arise, such as issues experienced on the 787 and 747-8 programs, we may experience schedule delays and higher costs to complete new programs and derivative aircraft. Additionally, price escalation factors may also impact margins by reducing the estimated price of airplanes delivered in the future. There are other factors that could also result in lower margins or a material charge if a program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses. These include: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Boeing Defense, Space & Security Business Environment and Trends U.S. Defense Environment Overview The U.S. continues to balance funding priorities to plan for the broadest possible range of operations that include homeland defense, natural disasters, stabilization efforts, counterinsurgency and counterterrorism operations, or nation state aggressors with growing sophistication and military means. The U.S. Department of Defense (U.S. DoD) faces the simultaneous requirements to execute the national security policy, recapitalize important capabilities, and transform the force to meet the changing national security threat environment as articulated in the 2010 National Security Strategy and Quadrennial Defense Review. These actions must be carried out against a backdrop of significant competing national priorities including the economic crisis, the national debt and healthcare reform. As a result, the traditional roles of defense and security are converging into a single set of customer needs. We anticipate that the national security environment will remain dynamic and challenging well into this decade trending with the threat environment. U.S. government policies impacting the defense environment include: efficiency initiatives to save at least $100 billion through 2016, defense acquisition reform, increased insourcing, concerns over the decline of the U.S. industrial base, a shift in emphasis towards more affordable solutions, and emphasis on increasing diplomatic efforts to expand and strengthen our alliances. In January 2011, the U.S. DoD announced its intention to further reduce its top-line base budget by $78 billion over the next five years. Although the U.S. DoD budget has grown substantially over the past decade, we expect the total budget growth rate to level off or even decline slightly over the next several years due to these shifting priorities and budget pressures. The fiscal year 2011 discretionary budget of $708 billion includes an Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) budget of $159 billion. Procurement is expected to increase, while research and development accounts are expected to decrease due to growing requirements from operations and maintenance (O&M) and personnel costs tied to U.S. commitments overseas. However, this trend is partially offset by equipment recapitalization efforts and continued demand for systems development. The near-term forecast of the defense budget environment shows limited growth in the 2012 to 2016 period for investment efforts. Although opportunities may exist following complete U.S. troop draw-downs in Iraq in late 2011, they may be offset by sustained O&M requirements in Afghanistan. Early indications suggest that coalition forces will sustain operations in the Afghanistan Theater longer than initially anticipated. We continue to see pressure to reduce OCO requests that have been used to cover the ongoing costs of the wars. 29 Table of Contents It is unlikely that the U.S. DoD will be able to fully fund all programs of record already in development as well as new initiatives. This imbalance between future costs of programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the U.S. DoD and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules, restructuring programs, and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding and occasionally by cancellation of programs. We expect the U.S. DoD will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies from acquisition efficiencies and reforms and emphasizing utilization of commercial off-the-shelf solutions and network-enabled operations. These strategies will be enabled through persistent intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR), long-range strike, special operations, unmanned systems, cybersecurity, precision-guided kinetic and non-kinetic weapons, electronic warfare, as well as selected outsourcing of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs. International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by rapidly evolving security challenges and countries’ need to modernize aging inventories. Western governments are pressured by new threats to security while at the same time dealing with constrained budgets. In Europe, global economic conditions are creating downward pressure on budget resources and austerity measures have been put in place to reduce defense spending in the near term. The strongest opportunities for 2011 growth of the BDS portfolio will be in the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions where modernization budgets remain relatively stable. With increasing needs and aging equipment, these regions have the financial strength necessary to make future defense purchases. Boeing's portfolio of defense, space and security solutions offers proven capability, predictable price, and near-term availability that are well matched to this challenging international environment. Adjacent Market Environment Overview We are repositioning our business to expand our capabilities and accelerate growth in the following targeted adjacencies: Unmanned Systems; Cyber and Information Services; Security; Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); and Logistics Command and Control (LogC2) and Energy Services. We anticipate continued growth in unmanned systems as these products provide critical mission functions to the warfighter with a focus on affordability, persistence, and accuracy. The demand for defensive, offensive, and exploit operations in the emerging Cyber market provides unique growth opportunities as explicit needs are further defined by customers. Key growth areas in Security include aviation security, border security, maritime security and cybersecurity as the U.S. government looks to work more closely with state and local institutions. The dependence on time-critical information for intelligence-based operations has fueled the need for C4ISR technologies that locate, identify, and track elusive and ephemeral targets. We continue to find opportunity in the LogC2 market in areas including logistics operations, supply chain management, and logistics training and simulations. Lastly, as energy volatility increases and pressure is placed on the national grid infrastructure, we expect that the need for energy services such as energy management, infrastructure security, and scenario modeling will increase accordingly. BDS Realignment Effective January 1, 2010, 2009 and 2008, certain programs were realigned among BDS segments. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. 30 Table of Contents Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Revenues $ 31,943 $ 33,661 $ 32,047 % of Total company revenues 50 % 49 % 53 % Earnings from operations $ 2,875 $ 3,299 $ 3,232 Operating margins 9.0 % 9.8 % 10.1 % Research and development $ 1,136 $ 1,101 $ 933 Contractual backlog $ 48,364 $ 46,024 $ 45,285 Unobligated backlog $ 16,822 $ 18,815 $ 27,719 Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Revenues BDS revenues decreased by $1,718 million in 2010 compared with 2009, due to lower revenues in all three segments, with the largest decrease in the N&SS segment. BDS revenues increased by $1,614 million in 2009 compared with 2008, due to higher revenues in GS&S and BMA, partially offset by decreases in N&SS. Operating Earnings BDS operating earnings in 2010 decreased by $424 million compared with 2009 primarily due to lower margins in the BMA segment and lower revenues in the N&SS segment. BDS operating earnings in 2009 increased by $67 million compared with 2008 primarily due to higher earnings in the BMA segment, partially offset by lower earnings in the N&SS segment. Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog increased by less than 1% in 2010, from $64,839 million to $65,186 million, primarily due to multi-year procurement contract awards on the F/A-18 and International Space Station programs, two commercial satellite contract awards, and the UK Future Logistics Information Services (FLIS) contract award, offset by current year deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished. Examples of these programs include Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals, BCTM, GMD, Joint Tactical Radio System, P-8A Poseidon and Proprietary programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays 31 Table of Contents and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of our fixed-price development programs include Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C), P-8I, KC-767 International Tanker, and commercial and military satellites. Boeing Military Aircraft Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Revenues $ 14,238 $ 14,304 $ 13,445 % of Total company revenues 22 % 21 % 22 % Earnings from operations $ 1,258 $ 1,528 $ 1,294 Operating margins 8.8 % 10.7 % 9.6 % Research and development $ 589 $ 582 $ 486 Contractual backlog $ 25,094 $ 26,354 $ 25,802 Unobligated backlog $ 8,297 $ 9,297 $ 10,035 Revenues BMA revenues decreased by less than 1% in 2010 and increased by 6% in 2009. Lower revenues in 2010 on the C-17, Apache and T-45 programs were nearly offset by higher Chinook, F/A-18 and AEW&C revenues. The increase of $859 million in 2009 was primarily due to higher revenues on the Apache, V-22, Chinook, F/A-18, and Proprietary programs, partly offset by lower revenues on the F-22 and several weapons programs. Deliveries of new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 F/A-18 Models 50 49 45 F-15E Eagle 13 13 14 C-17 Globemaster 14 16 16 AH-64 Apache 13 23 3 CH-47 Chinook 20 11 12 AEW&C 4 KC-767 Tanker 1 2 2 T-45TS Goshawk 7 7 Total new-build production aircraft 115 121 99 Operating Earnings BMA earnings decreased by $270 million in 2010 primarily due to lower deliveries of C-17 aircraft and less favorable pricing and mix on the C-17 program. BMA operating earnings increased by $234 million in 2009 partly due to higher deliveries on several programs and volume, partially offset by a change in delivery mix. Operating earnings in both years were negatively impacted by charges recorded on the AEW&C and KC-767 International Tanker programs. 32 Table of Contents Research and Development The BMA segment continues to focus research and development resources to leverage customer knowledge, technical expertise and system integration of manned and unmanned systems that provide innovative solutions to meet the warfighter’s enduring needs. Research and development expense remained flat in 2010 but in 2009 increased by 20% over 2008 primarily due to increased prototyping activities which were partially offset by lower international tanker development costs. Research and development activities utilize our capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to better prepare us to meet customers’ needs in U.S. and international growth areas such as: military-commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, global strike, missiles and unmanned airborne systems, and surveillance and engagement systems. The products of our research and development support both new manned and unmanned systems as well as enhanced versions of existing fielded products. Investments support vertical integration of our product line in areas such as autonomous operation of unmanned systems, advanced sensors and electronic warfare. These efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness, interoperability, reliability and reducing the cost of ownership. Backlog BMA total backlog in 2010 decreased 6% from 2009, primarily due to deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years partially offset by a multi-year contract award on the F/A-18 program. Total backlog in 2009 was virtually unchanged from 2008. Backlog increases due to 2009 orders for C-17, P-8I and Chinook aircraft were offset by revenues recognized on multi-year contracts received in prior years with the largest decrease in the F/A-18 program. Additional Considerations AEW&C The AEW&C development program, also known as Wedgetail in Australia, Peace Eagle in Turkey and Peace Eye in the Republic of Korea, consists of 737-700 aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems, some of which have never been installed on an airplane before. Wedgetail includes six aircraft and Peace Eagle and Peace Eye include four aircraft each. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded charges increasing the reach-forward losses on the AEW&C programs in Australia and Turkey by $174 million, $133 million and $308 million, respectively. These charges reflect technical performance issues associated with the test program, delivery schedule delays, subsystem development issues, and additional time for integration testing. During 2010, four Wedgetail aircraft were delivered to Australia with initial customer acceptance. Final customer acceptance for all six Wedgetail aircraft is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2011. In January 2011, the Peace Eagle program began the formal test phase. These are advanced and complex fixed-price development programs involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability. We believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate; however, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be delayed. KC-767 International Tanker The KC-767 International Tanker program includes four aircraft for the Italian Air Force and four aircraft for the Japanese Air Self Defense Force. During 2010, 2009 and 2008, we recorded charges increasing the reach-forward losses in the KC-767 International Tanker program by $53 million, $78 million and $85 million, respectively. The final delivery to Japan was made in December 2009 and first delivery to Italy was made in December 2010. The Italian KC-767 Tanker program is ongoing, and while we believe the revenue and cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of the program creates financial risk as additional completion and development costs may be necessary or remaining scheduled delivery dates could be delayed. C-17 See the discussion of the C-17 program in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 33 Table of Contents Network & Space Systems Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Revenues $ 9,455 $ 10,877 $ 11,346 % of Total company revenues 15 % 16 % 19 % Earnings from operations $ 711 $ 839 $ 1,034 Operating margins 7.5 % 7.7 % 9.1 % Research and development $ 417 $ 397 $ 298 Contractual backlog $ 9,586 $ 7,746 $ 8,868 Unobligated backlog $ 8,435 $ 9,187 $ 16,981 Revenues N&SS revenues decreased 13% in 2010 and 4% in 2009. The decrease of $1,422 million in 2010 is primarily due to lower volume on the BCTM and GMD programs. The decrease of $469 million in 2009 is primarily due to lower volume on the GMD, Intelligence and Security Systems, and Proprietary programs, partly offset by higher volume on several satellite programs. Delta launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Delta II 1 1 2 Delta IV 1 1 Commercial and civil satellites 3 3 1 Military satellites 1 3 Operating Earnings N&SS earnings decreased by $128 million in 2010 primarily due to lower revenues. N&SS earnings decreased by $195 million in 2009 primarily due to lower revenues and charges related to the Sea Launch bankruptcy. Earnings in 2009 were also reduced by charges related to the settlement of a satellite contract dispute and indemnification of Delta II inventory. Earnings in 2008 included a favorable settlement on a civil satellite program. N&SS operating earnings include equity earnings of $189 million, $164 million and $178 million from the United Space Alliance joint venture and the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Research and Development The N&SS research and development funding remains focused on the development of C4ISR that support a network-enabled architecture approach for our customers. We are investing in capabilities to enhance connectivity between existing and new air/ground and maritime platforms, to increase communications availability, utility and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and to leverage innovative networking and ISR concepts. Investments were also made to develop concepts and capabilities related to cyber and security products, as well as the development of next-generation space and intelligence systems. Along with increased funding to support these network-enabled capabilities, we also maintained our investment levels in missile defense, directed energy and advanced exploration systems. Backlog N&SS total backlog increased 6% in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to two commercial satellite contract awards, a multi-year contract award on the International Space Station program and GMD contract awards, partially offset by revenues recognized on the BCTM program. Total backlog decreased by 34% in 2009 compared with 2008 partly due to the partial termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the BCTM System Development and Demonstration contract related to Manned Ground Vehicles and associated systems and equipment. 2009 deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years including BCTM, GMD, and Proprietary programs also contributed to the backlog reduction. 34 Table of Contents Additional Considerations United Launch Alliance On December 1, 2006, we and Lockheed Martin Corporation (Lockheed) created a 50/50 joint venture named United Launch Alliance L.L.C. ULA combines the production, engineering, test and launch operations associated with U.S. government launches of Boeing Delta and Lockheed Atlas rockets. We initially contributed net assets of $914 million at December 1, 2006. The book value of our investment exceeded our proportionate share of ULA’s net assets. This difference is expensed ratably in future years. Based on the adjusted contributions and the conformed accounting policies established by ULA, this amortization is expected to be approximately $15 million annually for the next 14 years. In connection with the formation of ULA, we and Lockheed each committed to provide up to $200 million to support ULA’s working capital requirements through December 1, 2011. We and Lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain U.S. government contracts to ULA as of the closing date. We and Lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the U.S. government. We and Lockheed have also each committed to provide ULA with up to $232 million of additional capital contributions in the event ULA does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. We agreed to indemnify ULA through December 31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 million of Boeing Delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $1,860 million of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on March 31, 2021. Since inception, ULA has consumed $1,201 million of inventory that was contributed by us. ULA has made advance payments of $420 million to us and we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $166 million under the inventory supply agreement through December 31, 2010. ULA is continuing to assess the future of the Delta II program beyond what is currently on contract. In the event ULA is unable to sell additional Delta II inventory, our earnings could be reduced by up to $70 million. We agreed to indemnify ULA against potential losses that ULA may incur in the event ULA is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the U.S. Air Force (USAF) for four satellite missions. We believe ULA is entitled to additional contract pricing. In December 2008, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value for two satellite missions. In March 2009, the USAF issued a denial of that claim and in June 2009, ULA filed an appeal. During 2009, the USAF exercised its option for a third satellite mission. During the third quarter of 2010, ULA submitted a claim to the USAF to re-price the contract value of the third mission. The USAF did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to expiration. If ULA is unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for a portion of the shortfall and may record up to $283 million in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions, representing up to $261 million for the indemnification payment and up to $22 million for our portion of additional contract losses incurred by ULA. Sea Launch See the discussion of the Sea Launch receivables in Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Satellites See the discussions of Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. (BSSI) in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 35 Table of Contents Global Services & Support Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Revenues $ 8,250 $ 8,480 $ 7,256 % of Total company revenues 13 % 12 % 12 % Earnings from operations $ 906 $ 932 $ 904 Operating margins 11.0 % 11.0 % 12.5 % Research and development $ 130 $ 122 $ 149 Contractual backlog $ 13,684 $ 11,924 $ 10,615 Unobligated backlog $ 90 $ 331 $ 703 Revenues GS&S revenues decreased $230 million in 2010, a decrease of 3%, and increased $1,224 million in 2009, an increase of 17%, in each case compared with the prior year. The 2010 decrease is primarily due to lower revenues on several Maintenance, Modifications and Upgrades (MM&U) programs partially offset by higher revenues on several Integrated Logistics (IL) programs. The 2009 increase was due to increased volume in the IL programs and the Training Systems and Services (TS&S) divisions. Operating Earnings GS&S operating earnings decreased by 3% in 2010 primarily due to lower revenues. Operating earnings increased 3% in 2009 as additional earnings from increased volume were partially offset by lower margins due to contract adjustments and changes in contract mix. Research and Development GS&S continues to focus investment strategies on its core businesses including IL, MM&U and TS&S, as well as on moving into new market areas of logistics command and control (Log C2) in Advanced Services and energy management in Boeing Energy. Investments have been made to continue the development and implementation of innovative tools, processes and systems as market discriminators in the delivery of integrated customer solutions. Backlog GS&S total backlog increased by 12% in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to the award of the UK FLIS contract. Backlog also increased due to increases in several IL and MM&U programs, partially offset by decreases in several Training Systems programs. Total backlog increased by 8% in 2009 compared with 2008 due to significant growth in International Support and Defense and Government Services programs and partially offset by decreases in several IL and MM&U programs. Boeing Capital Corporation Business Environment and Trends BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2010 totaled $4,694 million. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is concentrated among certain U.S. commercial airline customers. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types most notably out of production Boeing aircraft such as 717 aircraft. We provided greater amounts of financing to Boeing customers during 2009 than in any of the preceding five years. Sources of financing available for aircraft deliveries improved during 2010 and as a result, we provided no financing for Boeing aircraft deliveries. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,200 western-built commercial jet aircraft (10.5% of current world fleet) were 36 Table of Contents parked at the end of 2010, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, over 30% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2009 and 2008, 11.6% and 11.0% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Revenues $ 639 $ 660 $ 703 Earnings from operations $ 152 $ 126 $ 162 Operating margins 24 % 19 % 23 % Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes. BCC’s revenues decreased $21 million and $43 million in 2010 and 2009, due to a smaller portfolio of equipment under operating leases as a result of aircraft returns and lower lease rates on re-leased aircraft. Earnings From Operations BCC’s operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings increased by $26 million in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to lower impairment expense and lower provision for losses. The impact of declines in aircraft collateral values recognized by BCC and reduced projected cash flows for certain aircraft was not as significant in 2010 as it was in 2009. The decrease in operating earnings in 2009 compared with 2008 was primarily due to lower revenues and higher asset impairment expense and provision for losses. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31: (Dollars in millions) 2010 2009 BCC Customer Financing and Investment Portfolio $ 4,694 $ 5,666 Valuation Allowance as a % of Total Receivables 3.8 % 2.5 % Debt $ 3,446 $ 4,075 Debt-to-Equity Ratio 5.0-to-1 5.8-to-1 BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2010 decreased from December 31, 2009 due to normal portfolio run-off and asset pre-payments. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, BCC had $583 million and $385 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, of which $28 million and $345 million had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. The increase was primarily due to BCC’s termination of aircraft leases with Aevovias Caribe S.A. de C.V. (Click), an affiliate of Compania Mexicana de Aviacion S.A. de C.V. (Mexicana), in August 2010. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $174 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2011. These aircraft are being remarketed or we are seeking to have the leases extended. 37 Table of Contents BCC enters into certain transactions with the Other segment in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment. Bankruptcies In August 2010, Mexicana filed for bankruptcy protection in Mexico and the United States. At the time of those filings, BCC had leased and delivered 19 717 aircraft to Click, and 6 additional 717 aircraft were scheduled for delivery to Click under executed leases. On August 27, 2010, BCC served Click a notice of termination of all 25 leases as a result of non-payment. On or about August 28, 2010, Click ceased flight operations. In September 2010, Click filed for bankruptcy protection. BCC has recovered all of the aircraft that had been delivered to Click. In the third quarter of 2010, we recorded an $81 million net impairment charge related to certain 717 aircraft leased to Click. This charge was primarily recorded in the Other segment due to an intercompany guarantee between us and BCC. Additional impairment charges could be recorded if we are unable to re-lease the aircraft at anticipated rental rates. Southwest/AirTran Merger On September 26, 2010, Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest) and AirTran Holdings, Inc. (AirTran) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, whereby Southwest will acquire, subject to certain conditions, all of the outstanding common stock of AirTran. AirTran, together with its subsidiaries, represents approximately 27% of our gross customer financing portfolio carrying value, consisting principally of 717 aircraft. AirTran is the largest customer in terms of BCC’s segment revenue and customer financing portfolio carrying value. Restructurings and Restructuring Requests From time to time, certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. As of December 31, 2010, BCC has not reached agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material adverse effect on its earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. Other Segment (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Revenues $ 138 $ 165 $ 567 Loss from operations (327 ) (152 ) (307 ) Other segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $175 million primarily due to $144 million of charges related to our customer financing portfolio and higher environmental remediation expenses of $36 million. Other segment revenues for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $402 million compared with 2008 primarily due to the sale of three C-17 aircraft in 2008 held under operating lease. Other segment operating losses for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $155 million primarily due to recognition of pre-tax expense of $82 million in the prior year to increase the allowance for losses on customer financing receivables related to lower U.S. airline customer credit ratings. During 2009, Other segment recognized $76 million in lower charges relating to environmental remediation than in 2008. 38 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net earnings $ 3,307 $ 1,312 $ 2,672 Non-cash items 2,679 2,381 1,829 Changes in working capital (3,034 ) 1,910 (4,902 ) Net cash provided/(used) by operating activities 2,952 5,603 (401 ) Net cash (used)/provided by investing activities (4,831 ) (3,794 ) 1,888 Net cash (used)/provided by financing activities (1,962 ) 4,094 (5,202 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (15 ) 44 (59 ) Net (decrease)/increase in cash and cash equivalents (3,856 ) 5,947 (3,774 ) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 9,215 3,268 7,042 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 5,359 $ 9,215 $ 3,268 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities decreased by $2,651 million to $2,952 million during 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to higher net working capital in 2010, driven by growth in inventory as we continue to build inventories prior to the anticipated delivery and production ramp-up of the 787 and 747-8 programs. We expect the 787 inventory growth in 2011 to be similar to the growth experienced in 2010 while we expect 747-8 inventory to begin to decline as aircraft are delivered. Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities totaled $4,831 million during 2010 compared with $3,794 million used during 2009, primarily due to higher net contributions to time deposits during 2010. In 2010, capital expenditures totaled $1,125 million down from $1,186 million in 2009. We expect capital spending in 2011 to be higher than 2010 due to the ongoing construction of a 787 final assembly line in North Charleston, South Carolina and higher spending to support commercial airplane production rate increases. Expenditures on acquisitions totaled $932 million, up from $639 million, largely reflecting the acquisition of Argon ST, Inc. for $782 million. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities totaled $1,962 million during 2010 compared with $4,094 million provided during 2009, primarily due to proceeds from borrowings of $5,961 million in 2009. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, the recorded balance of debt was $12,421 million and $12,924 million, of which $948 million and $707 million were classified as short-term. This includes $3,446 million and $4,075 million of debt recorded at BCC, of which $801 million and $659 million were classified as short-term. In 2010, we repaid $689 million of debt, including repayments of $645 million of debt held at BCC. In 2010, we had 494,939 shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholding and did not repurchase any shares through our open market share repurchase program. During 2009 and 2008, cash used in our open market share repurchase program totaled $50 million and $2,937 million. In 2008, we also repurchased shares for $95 million as part of the ShareValue Trust distribution. Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2010 and at December 31, 2010, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $4,376 million ($1,500 million exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support possible commercial paper borrowings. 39 Table of Contents In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our pension plans were $9,854 million and $6,356 million underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an ERISA basis our plans are more than 100% funded. In 2011, we expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $500 million. Absent increases in interest rates and/or higher asset values, we may be required to make significant contributions to our pension plans in the future. As of December 31, 2010, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2010, and the estimated timing thereof. (Dollars in millions) Total Lessthan 1year 1-3years 3-5years After 5years Long-term debt (including current portion) $ 12,253 $ 876 $ 3,510 $ 2,103 $ 5,764 Interest on debt (1) 6,990 622 1,025 773 4,570 Pension and other postretirement cash requirements 20,638 632 1,622 6,643 11,741 Capital lease obligations 190 63 97 30 Operating lease obligations 1,159 217 280 164 498 Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 104,775 34,572 40,197 20,442 9,564 Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 12,676 12,345 331 Total contractual obligations $ 158,681 $ 49,327 $ 47,062 $ 30,155 $ 32,137 (1) Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2010. Variable rate debt was approximately 1% of our total debt at December 31, 2010. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the 40 Table of Contents Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Approximately 8% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for production goods, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2010, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2010, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $9.7 billion that extend through 2024. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2010, our total liability for income taxes payable, including uncertain tax positions, was $499 million, of which $81 million we expect to pay in the next twelve months. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining $418 million. Our income tax obligations are excluded from the table above. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 41 Table of Contents Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2010. (Dollars in millions) Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3 Years 4-5 years After 5years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $ 7,599 $ 5,560 $ 1,542 $ 328 $ 169 Commercial aircraft financing commitments 9,865 1,234 2,035 2,775 3,821 Total commercial commitments $ 17,464 $ 6,794 $ 3,577 $ 3,103 $ 3,990 Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we currently do not anticipate that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers; however there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 20 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our contesting the default termination of the A-12 aircraft, certain employment and benefits litigation, litigation/arbitration involving BSSI programs and civil securities litigation relating to disclosures concerning the 787 program. Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $721 million at December 31, 2010. For additional information, see Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We have recorded a net liability of $1,198 million at December 31, 2010 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of these contingencies, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. 42 Table of Contents Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. The development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts. Estimates of each significant contract’s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2010 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $319 million. A number of our contracts are in a reach–forward loss position. Changes to estimated loss in future periods are recorded immediately in earnings. Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling costs, and routine warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. 43 Table of Contents To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs, excluding the 747 and 787 programs, for all of 2010 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $261 million. The 747 program is in a reach-forward loss position having recorded a total of $2,037 million of reach-forward losses in 2009 and 2008. Absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs, subsequent deliveries are recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately. Our current assessment is that the 787 program does not have a reach-forward loss. The cumulative impacts of the production challenges, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts have created significant pressure on revenue and cost estimates such that we expect to record zero margin on the initial deliveries. The scale and duration of the 787 program is such that relatively minor changes in assumptions or variables could have a material effect on our reported results in any period if the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss. Aircraft Valuation Allowance for Losses on Customer Financing Receivables The allowance for losses on customer financing receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of customer financing receivables in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the customer financing receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings, collateral values and default rates. If each customer’s credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at December 31, 2010, the allowance would have decreased by $163 million or increased by $343 million. If the collateral values were 20% higher or lower at December 31, 2010, the allowance would have decreased by $94 million or increased by $72 million. If the cumulative default rates used for each rating category should increase or decrease 1%, the allowance would have increased or decreased by $7 million. Impairment Review for Assets Under Operating Leases and Held for Re-Lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re-lease when events or changes in 44 Table of Contents circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $30 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Residual Values Equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease. If the estimated residual values declined 20% at December 31, 2010, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $31 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, and a future cumulative pre-tax earnings reduction of approximately $132 million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods, of which approximately $30 million would be recognized in 2011. Our investment in sales-type/finance leases includes future minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of leased assets less unearned income. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the decline occurs. If the estimated residual values declined 20% at December 31, 2010, we estimate that we would have reduced pre-tax income by $50 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. April 1 is our annual testing date. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. Changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future 45 Table of Contents periods. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill. As of December 31, 2010 and 2009, we had $499 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would reduce the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets by less than $1 million. Postretirement Plans Almost all of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans with the exception of all nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008. We also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligations and Shareholders’ equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2010. (Dollars in millions) Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bps Pension plans Projected benefit obligation $ (1,772 ) $ 2,204 Net periodic pension cost (185 ) 225 Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (192 ) 228 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost (15 ) 17 Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2010 net periodic pension expense by $123 million. Differences between actual and expected returns can affect future year’s pension cost. The asset balance used to calculate the expected return on pension plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of assets over a five year period. Despite investment gains during 2010 and 2009, the significant losses incurred during 2008 will cause 2011 net periodic pension cost to increase by approximately $1.0 billion and the portion recognized in earnings for 2011 to increase by approximately $650 million primarily due to amortization of actuarial losses. Absent increases in interest rates, higher asset values and/or higher contributions, net periodic pension cost will increase further in future years. 46 Table of Contents The assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following year’s expense, recorded liabilities and Shareholders’ equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change as of December 31, 2010. (Dollars in millions) Change in medical trend rateIncrease 100 bps Change in medical trend rateDecrease 100 bps Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation $ 742 $ (654 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost 125 (110 ) 47 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Exposure to this risk is managed by generally matching the profile of BCC’s liabilities with that of BCC’s assets in relation to amount and terms such as expected maturities and fixed versus floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2010, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained rise in interest rates would be a $5 million increase to BCC’s pre-tax earnings. For purposes of the foregoing sensitivity analysis, we assume that the level of our floating rate assets and debt (including the impact of derivatives) remain unchanged from year-end 2010 and that they are all subject to immediate re-pricing. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our investments or customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. Based on the portfolio of other Boeing fixed-rate debt, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2010, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by $159 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by $173 million. At December 31, 2009, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by $136 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by $150 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. 48 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:40.946982
12927,BA,BOEING CO,2012,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Consolidated Results of Operations and Financial Condition Overview We are a global market leader in design, development, manufacture, sale and support of commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and services. We are one of the two major manufacturers of 100+ seat airplanes for the worldwide commercial airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the U.S. While our principal operations are in the U.S., we conduct operations in many countries and rely on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors. Our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses – Commercial Airplanes and Boeing Defense, Space & Security (BDS) – supplemented and supported by Boeing Capital Corporation (BCC). Taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. We focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. Commercial Airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. BDS integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. Our strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense focus on growth and productivity. Our strategy also benefits as the cyclicality of commercial and defense markets often offset. BCC delivers value by supporting our business units and managing overall financing exposure. Consolidated Results of Operations Revenues (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Commercial Airplanes $ 36,171 $ 31,834 $ 34,051 Boeing Defense, Space & Security 31,976 31,943 33,661 Boeing Capital Corporation 532 639 660 Other segment 138 138 165 Unallocated items and eliminations (82 ) (248 ) (256 ) Total $ 68,735 $ 64,306 $ 68,281 Revenues in 2011 increased by $4,429 million or 7% compared with 2010. Commercial Airplanes revenues increased by $4,337 million due to higher new airplane deliveries, including the impact of entry into service of the 787-8 and 747-8 Freighter, favorable new airplane delivery mix and higher commercial aviation services revenues. BDS revenues increased by $33 million primarily due to higher revenues in the Boeing Military Aircraft (BMA) and Global Services & Support (GS&S) segments, partially offset by lower revenues in the Network & Space Systems (N&SS) segment. Revenues in 2010 decreased by $3,975 million or 6% compared with 2009. Commercial Airplanes revenues decreased by $2,217 million due to lower 777 deliveries primarily resulting from a production rate change from 7 to 5 per month beginning in June 2010 and no deliveries on the 747 program due 19 Table of Contents to the transition from the 747-400 to the 747-8. These were partially offset by increases in commercial aviation services business. BDS revenues decreased by $1,718 million primarily due to lower revenues in the N&SS segment. Earnings From Operations The following table summarizes our earnings/(loss) from operations: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Commercial Airplanes $ 3,495 $ 3,006 $ (583 ) Boeing Defense, Space & Security 3,158 2,875 3,298 Boeing Capital Corporation 125 152 126 Other segment 54 (327 ) (151 ) Unallocated items and eliminations (988 ) (735 ) (594 ) Total $ 5,844 $ 4,971 $ 2,096 Operating earnings in 2011 increased by $873 million compared with 2010. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $489 million, primarily due to higher revenues and a reduction in research and development costs, partially offset by increases in period costs associated with business growth. BDS earnings increased by $283 million compared with 2010 due to higher earnings in the BMA and GS&S segments, partially offset by lower earnings in the N&SS segment. Other segment earnings increased by $381 million primarily due to a $241 million reduction in the allowance for losses on receivables during 2011. Unallocated items and eliminations in 2011 reduced earnings by $253 million compared with 2010 primarily due to higher pension and postretirement costs. Operating earnings in 2010 increased by $2,875 million compared with 2009. Commercial Airplanes earnings increased by $3,589 million, primarily due to $2,693 million of costs related to the first three 787 flight test aircraft included in research and development expense in 2009 and the 2009 reach-forward losses on the 747 program of $1,352 million. BDS earnings decreased by $423 million compared with 2009 due to lower margins in the BMA segment and lower revenues in the N&SS segment. Other segment earnings decreased by $176 million primarily due to $119 million in intercompany guarantees related to aircraft impairment charges and reduced aircraft collateral values. The most significant items included in Unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Share-based plans $ (83 ) $ (136 ) $ (189 ) Deferred compensation (61 ) (112 ) (158 ) Pension (269 ) 54 110 Postretirement (248 ) (59 ) (93 ) Eliminations and other (327 ) (482 ) (264 ) Total $ (988 ) $ (735 ) $ (594 ) Share-based plans expense decreased by $53 million in both 2011 and 2010 primarily due to the expiration of the ShareValue trust at June 30, 2010. Deferred compensation expense decreased by $51 million and $46 million in 2011 and 2010. The year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions. 20 Table of Contents Eliminations and other unallocated items expense decreased by $155 million in 2011 and increased by $218 million in 2010 primarily due to timing of intercompany expense allocations and elimination of profit on intercompany items. 2010 expense also includes a $55 million charitable contribution. Unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States of America (GAAP) in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for U.S. government contracting purposes. We recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of $3,127 million, $1,864 million and $1,816 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The increase in net periodic benefit costs related to pensions and other postretirement benefits is primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service costs driven by lower discount rates. Not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period. A portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense. The unallocated expense in 2011 includes $161 million of additional expense recorded during the third quarter due to an adjustment primarily related to prior years’ accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. See the discussion of the postretirement liabilities in Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Earnings from operations included the following amounts allocated to business segments and Other unallocated items and eliminations. (Dollars in millions) Pension Other PostretirementBenefits Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2011 2010 2009 Allocated to business segments $ (1,379 ) $ (1,155 ) $ (989 ) $ (444 ) $ (421 ) $ (522 ) Other unallocated items and eliminations (269 ) 54 110 (248 ) (59 ) (93 ) Total $ (1,648 ) $ (1,101 ) $ (879 ) $ (692 ) $ (480 ) $ (615 ) Other Earnings Items (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Earnings from operations $ 5,844 $ 4,971 $ 2,096 Other income/(expense), net 47 52 (26 ) Interest and debt expense (498 ) (516 ) (339 ) Earnings before income taxes 5,393 4,507 1,731 Income tax expense (1,382 ) (1,196 ) (396 ) Net earnings from continuing operations $ 4,011 $ 3,311 $ 1,335 Other income decreased by $5 million in 2011 due to lower interest rates. The increase of $78 million in 2010 was driven by investment income on higher cash and investment balances. Interest and debt expense decreased by $18 million in 2011 due to the replacement of debt at lower interest rates. The increase of $177 million in 2010 was due to debt issued in 2009. Our effective income tax rate was 25.6%, 26.5% and 22.9% for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our effective tax rate was lower in 2011 than in 2010 primarily due to an income tax charge of $150 million recorded during the first quarter of 2010 as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as modified by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. During 2011, our effective tax rate was reduced by 7.4% due to a tax benefit of $397 million 21 Table of Contents recorded as a result of settling the 2004-2006 federal audit. We do not expect to settle any outstanding federal audits in 2012. Our effective tax rate was higher in 2010 than 2009, primarily because pre-tax book income in 2010 was higher than in 2009 and because of the income tax charge of $150 million recorded during the first quarter of 2010. This was partially offset by a tax benefit of $371 million recorded during the fourth quarter of 2010 as a result of settling the 1998-2003 federal audit. For additional discussion related to Income Taxes, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog Our backlog at December 31 was as follows: (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 2009 Contractual Backlog: Commercial Airplanes $ 293,303 $ 255,591 $ 250,476 Boeing Defense, Space & Security: Boeing Military Aircraft 24,085 25,094 26,354 Network & Space Systems 9,056 9,586 7,746 Global Services & Support 13,213 13,684 11,924 Total Boeing Defense, Space & Security 46,354 48,364 46,024 Total contractual backlog $ 339,657 $ 303,955 $ 296,500 Unobligated backlog $ 15,775 $ 16,871 $ 19,058 Contractual backlog of unfilled orders excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated U.S. and non-U.S. government contract funding. The increase in contractual backlog during 2011 and 2010 was due to commercial airplane orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation for undelivered commercial airplanes. Unobligated backlog includes U.S. and non-U.S. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2011 is due to decreases at BDS of $3,135 million compared with 2010 primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts and termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the Brigade Combat Team Modernization (BCTM) program, partially offset by the U.S. Air Force (USAF) contract for the KC-46A Tanker and the Missile Defense Agency Development and Sustainment Contract. The decrease in unobligated backlog during 2010 is due to decreases at BDS of $1,993 million compared with 2009 primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts including the V-22, BCTM and Chinook programs, partially offset by multi-year procurement contract awards on the F/A-18 and International Space Station programs. Additional Considerations KC-46A Tanker On February 24, 2011, we were awarded a contract from the USAF to design, develop, manufacture and deliver 4 next generation aerial refueling tankers. The KC-46A Tanker will be a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. This contract is a fixed-price incentive firm contract valued at $4.9 billion and involves highly complex designs. Changes to our estimated cost to perform the work could result in a material charge. This contract contains production options. If all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. For segment reporting purposes, backlog, revenues and costs are recorded in the Commercial Airplanes and BMA segments. 22 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations and Financial Condition Commercial Airplanes Business Environment and Trends Airline Industry Environment Political turmoil in the Middle East, the March 2011 natural disasters in Japan, the European sovereign debt crisis, deficit reduction challenges in the United States and high fuel prices continue to impact the global economy and airline traffic and costs. In the face of these challenges, passenger traffic has generally been more resilient than air cargo traffic. Air cargo traffic began contracting in May, and 2011 full year estimates indicate no growth over 2010. In contrast, 2011 passenger traffic year-over-year growth is expected to average around 6%, above the long-term average of 5%. However, there continues to be significant performance variation between regions and airline business models, with emerging markets and low cost carriers leading in the passenger markets. Despite relatively resilient passenger traffic, net profits for the global airline industry were impacted in 2011 by high oil prices, which were approximately 40% higher, on average, than 2010 prices. Net profits for the global airline industry are expected to be modest this year, totaling $7 billion in 2011, reduced from $16 billion in 2010. Airlines continue to focus on boosting revenue through alliances and partnerships and ancillary fees and services, while also cutting costs and renewing fleets to leverage more fuel efficient airplanes in a high-fuel-price environment. These airline strategies helped the airlines weather the global uncertainty in 2011. Current baseline forecasts for the economy and traffic suggest the outlook is for continued net profitability for the global airline industry in 2012, although expectations are that 2012 profits will be substantially lower than current estimates for 2011. Demand for commercial aircraft is also influenced by the availability of aircraft financing including export financing and other financing sources. Going into 2012 the European sovereign debt crisis remains a significant risk to the global economy and the airline industry. The long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5% - 6% per year for passenger and cargo traffic, based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. Based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $4.0 trillion market for 33,500 new airplanes over the next 20 years. The industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, and increased global environmental regulations. Industry Competitiveness The commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. Market liberalization in Europe and Asia has enabled low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. These airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares. This results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. Major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins. Continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. Approximately 15% of Commercial Airplanes’ contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with U.S. airlines. We face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. They offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. Airbus has 23 Table of Contents historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. Regional jet makers Embraer and Bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. Additionally, other competitors from Russia, China and Japan are likely to enter the 70 to 190 seat airplane market over the next few years. Many of these competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including “launch aid,” which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated with airplane development activities and enables airplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. This market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years. Worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in U.S. dollars. Fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. Changes in value of the U.S. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors’ revenues and profits. Competitors routinely respond to a relatively weaker U.S. dollar by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. Airbus has announced such initiatives targeting overhead cost savings, a reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity through 2012. If the U.S. dollar strengthens, Airbus can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings. We are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. We continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. This enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. These efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 36,171 $ 31,834 $ 34,051 % of Total company revenues 53 % 50 % 50 % Earnings/(loss) from operations $ 3,495 $ 3,006 $ (583 ) Operating margins 9.7 % 9.4 % -1.7 % Research and development $ 2,715 $ 2,975 $ 5,383 Contractual backlog $ 293,303 $ 255,591 $ 250,476 Unobligated backlog $ 2,088 $ 49 $ 242 Revenues Year-over-year changes in Revenue are shown in the following table: (Dollars in millions) 2011vs. 2010 2010vs. 2009 New airplane sales $ 3,766 $ (2,733 ) Commercial aviation services 594 569 Other (23 ) (53 ) Total $ 4,337 $ (2,217 ) 24 Table of Contents Revenues for 2011 increased by $4,337 million or 13.6% compared with 2010 due to higher new airplane deliveries, including the impact of entry into service of the 787-8 and 747-8 Freighter, favorable commercial airplane delivery model mix and higher commercial aviation services revenues. The increase in revenues from commercial aviation services was primarily due to increased sales of spares. Revenues for 2010 decreased by $2,217 million or 6.5% compared with 2009. The decrease in new airplane revenues primarily reflects lower 777 deliveries resulting from a production rate change from 7 to 5 per month beginning in June 2010 and no deliveries on the 747 program due to the transition from the 747-400 to the 747-8 derivative. The increase in revenues from commercial aviation services business was primarily due to increased sales of spares. Commercial airplanes deliveries as of December 31 were as follows: 737 747 767 777 787 Total 2011 Cumulative Deliveries 3,878 1,427 1,014 983 3 Deliveries 372 (1) 9 20 73 3 477 2010 Cumulative Deliveries 3,506 1,418 994 910 Deliveries 376 (1) 12 74 462 2009 Cumulative Deliveries 3,130 1,418 982 836 Deliveries 372 (1) 8 13 88 481 (1) Includes intercompany deliveries of 7 737 airplanes in 2011, 5 737 airplanes in both 2010 and 2009. Earnings From Operations Earnings from operations for 2011 increased by $489 million compared with 2010. This increase reflects earnings of $376 million from higher revenues on new airplane deliveries, $180 million of higher earnings due to commercial aviation services volume and margins and $261 million of lower research and development expense, partially offset by increases of $328 million reflecting higher fleet support costs and other costs associated with business growth. Earnings from operations for 2010 increased by $3,589 million compared with 2009. The increase was primarily due to the 2009 reclassification from inventory to research and development expense of costs related to the first three 787 flight test airplanes, and the 2009 reach-forward losses on the 747 program. Costs of $2,693 million included in research and development expense in 2009 for the first three flight test 787 airplanes were a result of our determination that these airplanes could not be sold. The reach-forward loss on the 747 program of $1,352 million during 2009 was primarily due to increased production costs, reductions in projected delivery price increases associated with escalation and the difficult market conditions affecting the 747-8. The remaining net decrease in earnings for 2010 was primarily attributable to increased research and development expense of $285 million and lower new airplane deliveries. Backlog Firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before Boeing and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their Board of Directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Firm orders exclude options. A number of our customers may have 25 Table of Contents contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. We continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. However, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers. The increase in contractual backlog during 2011 and 2010 was due to orders in excess of deliveries and changes in projected revenue escalation, partially reduced by cancellations of orders. The increase in unobligated backlog in 2011 represents Commercial Airplanes’ share of the USAF contract for the KC-46A Tanker. Accounting Quantity The accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. It is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program’s life. Estimation of each program’s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. We review our program accounting quantities quarterly. The accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered. The table below provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of December 31. Cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet airplane deliveries plus undelivered firm orders. Program 737 747 767 777 787 2011 Program accounting quantities 6,200 1,549 1,084 1,350 1,100 Undelivered units under firm orders 2,365 97 72 380 857 Cumulative firm orders 6,243 1,524 1,086 1,363 860 2010 Program accounting quantities 5,000 1,524 1,048 1,150 * Undelivered units under firm orders 2,186 107 50 253 847 Cumulative firm orders 5,692 1,525 1,044 1,163 847 2009 Program accounting quantities 4,600 1,499 1,035 1,100 * Undelivered units under firm orders 2,076 108 59 281 851 Cumulative firm orders 5,206 1,526 1,041 1,117 851 * The initial accounting quantity for the 787 program was established in the third quarter of 2011. 737 Program The accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 1,200 units in 2011 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. During 2010, we announced plans to increase monthly production from 31.5 to 35 airplanes per month beginning in 2012 and a further increase to 38 airplanes per month beginning in 2013. On June 15, 2011, to address continued demand for delivery positions, we announced plans to increase production of the 737 to 42 airplanes per month beginning in 2014. On August 30, 2011, we announced the launch of the 737 MAX, the new engine variant of the 737. First delivery of the 737 MAX is expected in 2017. 26 Table of Contents 747 Program The accounting quantity for the 747 program increased by 25 units in 2011. The 747-8 Freighter was certified during the third quarter and first delivery occurred in October 2011. First flight of the 747-8 Intercontinental passenger derivative occurred in March 2011 and type certification was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2011. During 2011, expected first delivery of the 747-8 Intercontinental was moved from the fourth quarter of 2011 to the first quarter of 2012 due to a delay in flight testing and the time required to incorporate all flight test driven engineering and design changes. We remain focused on incorporating these and other changes identified during flight testing into completed airplanes, achieving a planned production rate increase from 1.5 to 2 airplanes per month in mid-2012, reducing out-of-sequence work and improving supply chain efficiency. We are also continuing to monitor cargo market conditions. If risks associated with these areas cannot be mitigated, the program could be impacted by customer claims, lower orders, supplier assertions and/or the recognition of an additional reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks. 767 Program The accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 36 units in 2011 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. 777 Program The accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 200 units in 2011 due to the program’s normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. The 777 program’s first delivery at 7 airplanes per month from 5 per month occurred in June 2011. A further increase to 8.3 airplanes per month is planned for the first quarter of 2013. 787 Program We completed initial type certification flight testing activities and received design and production certifications for the 787-8 during the third quarter of 2011. We delivered the first 787-8 airplane in September 2011 and delivered two additional aircraft in the fourth quarter of 2011. We also completed the critical design review for the 787-9 derivative in 2011. In October 2011 we announced that the expected date of first delivery of the 787-9 had moved to early 2014 from late 2013. We continued to produce aircraft during flight testing and established a separate facility to incorporate engineering and other design changes identified during flight testing on already completed aircraft. We expect that aircraft completed in our Everett facility through mid-year 2012 will also require change incorporation. However, we expect that these later airplanes will require significantly less change incorporation than airplanes completed prior to 2012. We remain focused on achieving planned increases in 787 production rates while continuing to satisfy customer mission and performance requirements. We also continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft assembly, including management of our extended global supply chain, incorporation of design changes into aircraft in various stages of assembly, completion and integration of traveled work as well as weight and systems integration. During 2011 we increased the production rate to 2.5 per month at our Everett final assembly line and started up the North Charleston final assembly line. We currently expect to increase the production rate of 787 aircraft to 10 aircraft per month in final assembly by the end of 2013 with first deliveries occurring at that rate in early 2014. Our efforts to achieve planned production rate targets include improving the production system, coordinating rate increases with suppliers, increasing production rates in both Everett and North Charleston, and establishing transitional surge capacity at Everett. In addition, we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of prior schedule changes, including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions. During 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. As a result, costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense. We believe that the other three 787 flight test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to those airplanes in program inventory at December 31, 2011. If we determine that one or more of the other aircraft cannot be sold, we may incur additional charges. 27 Table of Contents During the third quarter of 2011, we established an initial accounting quantity of 1,100 units, representing approximately 10 years of production at planned production rates. The cumulative impacts of production challenges, change incorporation, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts have created significant pressure on program profitability. As a result, we have recorded low margins on our 2011 deliveries. Future challenges, including not meeting one or more planned production rate increases going forward, or introducing the 787-9 derivative as scheduled, could result in additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions as well as result in further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. We continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks. Fleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. They include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services. These costs are expected to continue to increase due to the 787 and 747-8 entry into service. Research and Development The following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs. Our Research and development expense decreased by $260 million in 2011. This was primarily due to certification of the 747-8 Freighter and 787-8. Our Research and development expense decreased by $2,408 million in 2010. This was primarily due to the reclassification to research and development expense of $2,693 million of production costs related to the three 787 flight test airplanes in 2009, partially offset by a $285 million increase of other research and development expense. Additional Considerations The 787 and 747-8 programs highlight the risks inherent in new airplane programs and new derivative airplanes, including, for example, development of the 787-9. In the third quarter of 2011 we launched a variant of the 737 that will feature new more fuel efficient engines – the 737 MAX. Costs related to development of new programs and derivative airplanes are expensed as incurred. Costs to produce new airplanes are included in inventory and accounted for using program accounting. Airplane programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated production costs exceed our estimated program revenues for the accounting quantity. Generally commercial airplanes are sold on a firm fixed-price basis with an indexed price escalation clause and are often sold several years before scheduled delivery. Each customer purchase agreement contains an escalation clause to account for the effects of economic fluctuations over the period of time from airplane sale to airplane delivery. A price escalation formula based on pre-defined factors is used to determine the final price of the airplane at the time of customer delivery. While firm fixed-price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns. Many new airplanes and derivatives have highly 28 Table of Contents complex designs, utilize exotic materials and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners. As technical or quality issues arise, such as issues experienced on the 787 and 747-8 programs, we may experience schedule delays and higher costs to complete new programs and derivative airplanes. Additionally, price escalation factors may also impact margins by reducing the estimated price of airplanes delivered in the future. There are other factors that could also result in lower margins or a material charge if a program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses. These include: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. While we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. Boeing Defense, Space & Security Business Environment and Trends U.S. Defense Environment Overview In August 2011, the Budget Control Act (the Act) reduced the DoD top line budget by approximately $490 billion over 10 years starting in fiscal year (FY) 2013. In addition, barring Congressional action, further budget cuts (or sequestration) as outlined in the Act will be implemented in FY13. Sequestration would lead to additional reductions of approximately $500 billion from the Pentagon’s top line budget over the next decade, resulting in aggregate reductions of about $1 trillion over 10 years. The U.S. DoD has taken the position that such reductions would generate significant operational risks and require the termination of certain procurement programs. Overseas Contingency Operations funding for Iraq and Afghanistan is also expected to decrease due to the reduction of U.S. forces in those countries. In January 2012, the DoD announced its Defense Strategic Guidance (DSG) partly in response to these budgetary challenges. In response to the proposed “across the board” budget cuts the DSG proposed that the DoD prioritize the Asia Pacific and Middle East regions, shrink ground forces, maintain nuclear deterrence, and reduce Cold War assets. The DSG also emphasizes the increasing importance of Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (C4ISR); Cyber; Space; Special Operations; and Unmanned Systems in implementing the DoD’s strategic imperatives. Specific program allocations commensurate with this new guidance are expected to be announced in February 2012 as part of the President’s FY13 budget request. While the DSG’s proposals do incorporate some of the proposed funding reductions, they do not address the full impact that would be associated with sequestration pursuant to the Act. The budgetary pressures described above are expected to impact our other U.S. customers, including NASA, and the Intelligence community. To meet the needs of the DoD and other U.S. government customers in this challenging environment, BDS offers a balanced portfolio of platforms, services, and solutions that meet operational and fiscal requirements. However, these budgetary pressures are expected to place significant downward pressure on our revenues and margins in 2012. Target Market Environment Overview The DSG places strong emphasis on developing and acquiring specific capabilities for the U.S. Armed Forces. Capabilities expected to remain a focus of investment or increase per the DoD Strategic Guidance include: C4ISR; Cyber; Space; Special Operations; and Unmanned Systems. BDS has been anticipating this shift in DoD priorities and has aligned its strategy accordingly. As such, we have been making organic investments and pursuing targeted acquisitions to enhance our capabilities and better serve our customers and their emerging needs in these markets. 29 Table of Contents International Environment Overview The international market continues to be driven by rapidly evolving security challenges and the need for countries to modernize aging inventories. Western governments are pressured by new threats to security while at the same time dealing with constrained budgets. In Europe, the continuing financial crisis and the growing potential for a double dip recession are causing a contraction in the credit market and forcing governments to institute austerity measures that will negatively impact defense spending in the near term. The strongest opportunities for 2012 growth of the BDS portfolio will be in the Middle East and Asia Pacific regions where the relative financial strength of key countries coupled with a broad spectrum of evolving threats will result in procurement of defense and security systems. Similar to the domestic environment, BDS offers proven capability, predictable price, and near-term availability that are well suited to the enduring requirements in the international marketplace. BDS Realignment Effective January 1, 2011, 2010 and 2009, certain programs were realigned among BDS segments. Business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment. Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 31,976 $ 31,943 $ 33,661 % of Total company revenues 47 % 50 % 49 % Earnings from operations $ 3,158 $ 2,875 $ 3,298 Operating margins 9.9 % 9.0 % 9.8 % Research and development $ 1,138 $ 1,136 $ 1,101 Contractual backlog $ 46,354 $ 48,364 $ 46,024 Unobligated backlog $ 13,687 $ 16,822 $ 18,815 Since our operating cycle is long-term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules, the operating results of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of revenues and earnings, may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, depending on the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow-on contracts, or as one large multi-year order or long-term award. As a result, period-to-period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. The following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context. Revenues BDS revenues increased by $33 million in 2011 compared with 2010, due to higher revenues in the BMA and the GS&S segments, partially offset by lower revenues in the N&SS segment. BDS revenues decreased by $1,718 million in 2010 compared with 2009, due to lower revenues in all three segments, with the largest decrease in the N&SS segment. Operating Earnings BDS operating earnings in 2011 increased by $283 million compared with 2010 primarily due to higher earnings in the BMA and GS&S segments, partially offset by lower earnings in the N&SS segment. BDS operating earnings in 2010 decreased by $423 million compared with 2009 primarily due to lower margins in the BMA segment and lower revenues in the N&SS segment. 30 Table of Contents Backlog Total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding, and unobligated backlog, which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. BDS total backlog decreased by 8% in 2011, from $65,186 million to $60,041 million, primarily due to funding of existing multi-year contracts and termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the BCTM program, partially offset by new orders. For further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. Additional Considerations Our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished. Examples of these programs include Family of Beyond Line-of-Sight Terminals, P-8A and Proprietary programs. Some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. Many of these programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge. These programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. Examples of our fixed-price development programs include Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C), India P-8I, USAF KC-46A Tanker and commercial and military satellites. Boeing Military Aircraft Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 14,947 $ 14,238 $ 14,304 % of Total company revenues 22 % 22 % 21 % Earnings from operations $ 1,526 $ 1,250 $ 1,527 Operating margins 10.2 % 8.8 % 10.7 % Research and development $ 541 $ 589 $ 582 Contractual backlog $ 24,085 $ 25,094 $ 26,354 Unobligated backlog $ 7,155 $ 8,297 $ 9,297 Revenues BMA revenues increased by 5% in 2011. The increase of $709 million in 2011 was primarily due to higher AEW&C, C-17 and KC-767 International Tanker revenues. AEW&C revenues increased by $780 million in 2011 due to delivery of the first two Peace Eye aircraft and higher Wedgetail milestone revenues. C-17 revenues increased by $273 million reflecting favorable mix, partially offset by fewer deliveries. International Tanker revenues increased by $235 million due to higher deliveries. In 31 Table of Contents addition, initial revenues on the USAF KC-46A Tanker were recognized in 2011. Lower volumes on the F-22, F/A-18 and Apache programs combined to reduce revenues by $613 million. Boeing production deliveries on the F-22 program ended in 2011. There were no new-build Apache deliveries in 2011, however, new-build deliveries are expected to resume in 2012. BMA revenues decreased by less than 1% in 2010 compared with 2009. Lower revenues in 2010 on the C-17, Apache and T-45 programs were nearly offset by higher Chinook, F/A-18 and AEW&C revenues. Deliveries of new-build production aircraft, excluding remanufactures and modifications, were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 F/A-18 Models 49 50 49 F-15E Eagle 15 13 13 C-17 Globemaster 13 14 16 CH-47 Chinook 32 20 11 AEW&C 3 4 KC-767 International Tanker 3 1 2 AH-64 Apache 13 23 T-45TS Goshawk 7 Total new-build production aircraft 115 115 121 Operating Earnings BMA operating earnings increased by $276 million in 2011 primarily due to $236 million of higher earnings on the AEW&C program reflecting the initial Peace Eye deliveries and lower reach-forward loss provisions in 2011 on the AEW&C Wedgetail and Peace Eagle contracts. Lower reach-forward losses of $49 million on KC-767 International Tanker program and lower research and development also contributed to the earnings improvements. BMA operating earnings decreased by $277 million in 2010 primarily due to lower deliveries of C-17 aircraft and less favorable pricing and mix on the C-17 program. Research and Development The BMA segment continues to focus research and development resources to leverage customer knowledge, technical expertise and system integration of manned and unmanned systems that provide innovative solutions to meet the warfighter’s enduring needs. Research and development expense decreased in 2011 primarily due to lower International Tanker development costs. Research and development activities utilize our capabilities in architectures, system-of-systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to better prepare us to meet customers’ needs in U.S. and international growth areas such as: military-commercial derivatives, rotorcraft, global strike, missiles and unmanned airborne systems, and surveillance and engagement systems. The products of our research and development support both new manned and unmanned systems as well as enhanced versions of existing fielded products. Investments support vertical integration of our product line in areas such as autonomous operation of unmanned systems, advanced sensors and electronic warfare. These efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness, interoperability, reliability and reducing the cost of ownership. Backlog BMA total backlog in 2011 decreased by 6% from 2010, primarily due to current year deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years partially offset by BMA’s share of the USAF 32 Table of Contents contract awards for the KC-46A and low-rate initial production of the P-8A. Total backlog in 2010 decreased 6% from 2009, primarily due to deliveries and sales on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years partially offset by a multi-year contract award on the F/A-18 program. Additional Considerations AEW&C The AEW&C development program, also known as Wedgetail in Australia, Peace Eagle in Turkey and Peace Eye in the Republic of Korea, consists of 737-700 aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems, some of which have never been installed on an airplane before. A total of five Wedgetail aircraft have been delivered to Australia with initial customer acceptance. Four were delivered in 2010 and one in September 2011. The final Wedgetail aircraft is scheduled for delivery with initial customer acceptance in the first quarter of 2012. Final customer acceptance for all six Wedgetail aircraft is also scheduled to be completed during the first half of 2012. In January 2011, the Peace Eagle program began the formal test phase which is scheduled to conclude in the second half of 2012. The first Peace Eye aircraft was delivered to the Republic of Korea in September 2011 and the second in December 2011. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded charges increasing the reach-forward losses on the AEW&C programs in Australia and Turkey by $60 million, $174 million and $133 million, respectively. These are advanced and complex fixed-price development programs involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability. We believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate; however, the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be delayed, either of which could result in lower margins or additional material charges.

The decrease of $782 million in 2011 is primarily due to $577 million of lower revenues on the BCTM program which was terminated for convenience during 2011. Lower revenues on the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD), SBInet and Joint Tactical Radio System programs reduced revenues by $150 million, $146 million and $93 million respectively, partially offset by $150 million of higher sales of Delta inventory to United Launch Alliance (ULA) and $250 million of higher commercial and civil satellite revenues. The decrease of $1,422 million in 2010 is primarily due to lower volume on the BCTM and GMD programs. 33 Table of Contents Delta launch and new-build satellite deliveries were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Delta II 1 1 Delta IV 1 1 Commercial and civil satellites 1 3 3 Military satellites 3 1 3 Operating Earnings N&SS earnings decreased by $21 million in 2011 and $128 million in 2010 primarily due to lower revenues and higher research and development costs. N&SS operating earnings include equity earnings of $194 million, $189 million and $164 million from the United Space Alliance joint venture and the ULA joint venture in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Research and Development The N&SS research and development funding remains focused on the development of C4ISR that support a network-enabled architecture approach for our customers. Research and development expense increased in 2011 primarily due to higher expense associated with C4ISR prototypes. We are investing in capabilities to enhance connectivity between existing and new air/ground and maritime platforms, to increase communications availability, utility and bandwidth through more robust space systems, and to leverage innovative networking and ISR concepts. Investments were also made to develop concepts and capabilities related to cyber and security products, as well as the development of next-generation space and intelligence systems. Along with increased funding to support these network-enabled capabilities, we also maintained our investment levels in missile defense, directed energy and advanced exploration systems. Backlog N&SS total backlog decreased 14% in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to termination for convenience by the U.S. Army of the BCTM program and revenues recognized on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by the contract award for the Missile Defense Agency Development and Sustainment Contract. Total backlog increased 6% in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to two commercial satellite contract awards, a multi-year contract award on the International Space Station program and GMD contract awards, partially offset by revenues recognized on the BCTM program. Additional Considerations Sea Launch See the discussion of the Sea Launch receivables in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Satellites See the discussions of Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. 34 Table of Contents Global Services & Support Operating Results (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 8,356 $ 8,250 $ 8,480 % of Total company revenues 12 % 13 % 12 % Earnings from operations $ 942 $ 914 $ 932 Operating margins 11.3 % 11.1 % 11.0 % Research and development $ 121 $ 130 $ 122 Contractual backlog $ 13,213 $ 13,684 $ 11,924 Unobligated backlog $ 108 $ 90 $ 331 Revenues GS&S revenues increased $106 million in 2011, an increase of 1%, and decreased $230 million in 2010, a decrease of 3%, in each case compared with the prior year. The 2011 increase is primarily due to higher revenues on several Integrated Logistics (IL) programs and a Defense & Government services contract, partially offset by lower revenues from Maintenance, Modifications and Upgrades (MM&U) due to the conclusion in 2010 of our KC-10 support program. The 2010 decrease is primarily due to lower revenues on several MM&U programs partially offset by higher revenues on several IL programs. Operating Earnings GS&S operating earnings increased by 3% in 2011 primarily due to higher earnings on several IL programs, partially offset by lower earnings on MM&U programs. Operating earnings decreased 2% in 2010 primarily due to lower revenues. Research and Development GS&S focused on its investment strategies in the following core businesses: IL, MM&U, Training Systems & Services (TS&S), and Defense & Government Services. Our investments also fund investigation into synergies between existing markets through our Advanced Services organization. This research continues the development and implementation of innovative tools, processes and systems which will deliver affordable readiness solutions to our customers. Backlog GS&S total backlog decreased by 3% in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to revenues recognized on multi-year contracts awarded in prior years on several IL programs, partially offset by a TS&S contract award on the P-8A program. Total backlog increased by 12% in 2010 compared with 2009 primarily due to the award of the UK LogNEC contract. Backlog also increased due to increases in several IL and MM&U programs, partially offset by decreases in several TS&S programs. Boeing Capital Corporation Business Environment and Trends BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2011 totaled $4,327 million. A substantial portion of BCC’s portfolio is concentrated among certain U.S. commercial airline customers. BCC’s portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types most notably out-of-production Boeing aircraft such as 717 aircraft. 35 Table of Contents BCC provided customer financing of $239 million and $72 million during 2011 and 2010. The European sovereign debt crisis poses a financing risk to airlines and may reduce overall levels of commercial aircraft financing. However, we expect the reduction in funding from European commercial banks to be largely offset by increased financing availability from other sources, such as capital markets, lessors, and banks from other regions of the world. Aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. Approximately 2,000 western-built commercial jet aircraft (9.4% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2011, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, approximately 30% are not expected to return to service. At the end of 2010 and 2009, 10.5% and 11.6% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. Aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service. Summary Financial Information (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 532 $ 639 $ 660 Earnings from operations $ 125 $ 152 $ 126 Operating margins 23 % 24 % 19 % Revenues BCC segment revenues consist principally of lease income from equipment under operating lease and interest from financing receivables and notes. BCC’s revenues decreased $107 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to lower operating lease income from a smaller portfolio of equipment under operating leases as a result of aircraft returns and lower lease rates on re-leased aircraft and lower interest income on notes receivable resulting from a lower weighted average notes receivable balance and a decrease in the weighted average annual effective interest rate during 2011. The decrease in revenues in 2010 compared with 2009 of $21 million was primarily due to lower operating lease income from a smaller portfolio of equipment under operating leases as a result of aircraft returns and lower lease rates on re-leased aircraft. Earnings From Operations BCC’s operating earnings are presented net of interest expense, provision for (recovery of) losses, asset impairment expense, depreciation on leased equipment and other operating expenses. Operating earnings decreased by $27 million in 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to lower revenues and higher asset impairment expense partially offset by lower interest expense, lower depreciation expense and a reduction in the allowance for losses. The increase in operating earnings in 2010 compared with 2009 was primarily due to lower asset impairment expense and a reduction in the allowance for losses. Financial Position The following table presents selected financial data for BCC as of December 31: (Dollars in millions) 2011 2010 BCC customer financing and investment portfolio $ 4,327 $ 4,694 Valuation allowance as a % of total receivables 2.2 % 3.8 % Debt $ 3,400 $ 3,446 Debt-to-equity ratio 6.2-to-1 5.0-to-1 36 Table of Contents BCC’s customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2011 decreased from December 31, 2010 due to normal portfolio run-off and asset sales, partially offset by the origination of notes receivable and purchase of equipment under operating lease. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, BCC had $521 million and $583 million of assets that were held for sale or re-lease, of which $476 million and $28 million had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease. Additionally, aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately $111 million are scheduled to be returned off lease during 2012. These aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and approximately $13 million of such aircraft had either executed term sheets with deposits or firm contracts as of December 31, 2011. BCC enters into certain transactions with the Other segment in the form of guarantees and other subsidies that mitigate the effects of certain credit quality or asset impairment issues on the BCC segment. Bankruptcies On November 29, 2011, American Airlines, Inc. (American Airlines) filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. American Airlines retains certain rights by operating under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, including the right to reject executory contracts, such as aircraft leases. At December 31, 2011 American Airlines accounted for $653 million of our customer financing portfolio, including $362 million recorded by BCC. American Airlines has not rejected any of the leases related to our aircraft. We believe that our customer financing receivables from American Airlines are sufficiently collateralized such that we do not expect to incur losses related to those receivables as a result of the bankruptcy. We continue to monitor the American Airlines bankruptcy for potential impacts on our business. Restructurings and Restructuring Requests From time to time, certain customers have requested a restructuring of their transactions with BCC. As of December 31, 2011, BCC has not reached agreement on any restructuring requests that would have a material effect on our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position. On May 2, 2011, Southwest Airlines Co. (Southwest) completed its acquisition of AirTran Holdings, Inc. AirTran Holdings’ successor entity (AirTran) and its subsidiaries represent approximately 26% of our gross customer financing portfolio carrying value, consisting principally of 717 aircraft. AirTran is the largest customer in terms of BCC’s segment revenue and customer financing portfolio carrying value. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we revised the contractual terms of our leases with AirTran in conjunction with receiving a full guarantee from Southwest of those lease payment obligations. Revenue and earnings are expected to be approximately $30 million lower in 2012 due to these lease revisions. Other Segment (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Revenues $ 138 $ 138 $ 165 Earnings/(loss) from operations 54 (327 ) (152 ) Other segment operating earnings for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $381 million compared with 2010 primarily due to a $241 million reduction in the allowance for losses on AirTran receivables and $124 million of lower impairment charges related to our customer financing portfolio in 2011. 37 Table of Contents Other segment operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $175 million primarily due to $144 million of charges related to our customer financing portfolio and higher environmental remediation expenses of $36 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Summary (Dollars in millions) Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net earnings $ 4,018 $ 3,307 $ 1,312 Non-cash items 2,140 2,679 2,381 Changes in working capital (2,135 ) (3,034 ) 1,910 Net cash provided by operating activities 4,023 2,952 5,603 Net cash provided/(used) by investing activities 2,369 (4,831 ) (3,794 ) Net cash (used)/provided by financing activities (1,700 ) (1,962 ) 4,094 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (2 ) (15 ) 44 Net increase/(decrease) in cash and cash equivalents 4,690 (3,856 ) 5,947 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year 5,359 9,215 3,268 Cash and cash equivalents at end of year $ 10,049 $ 5,359 $ 9,215 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities increased by $1,071 million to $4,023 million during 2011 compared with 2010 primarily due to higher earnings and lower working capital growth as the continued growth in inventory was partially offset by increases in advances from customers and accounts payable. Our investment in gross inventories increased to $56,499 million at December 31, 2011, up from $46,738 million at December 31, 2010 while advances and progress billings increased to $39,755 million at December 31, 2011 compared with $34,744 million at December 31, 2010. The increase in inventory was driven by higher investments in commercial airplane program inventory, specifically 787 inventory, while higher advances and progress payments reflect increased production rates and commercial airplane orders. We expect inventory to grow at a lower rate in 2012 as additional deliveries offset the ramp up of commercial airplane production and as design changes are incorporated into completed 747 and 787 airplanes. Cash contributions to our pension plans totaled $531 million and $35 million in 2011 and 2010. Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities totaled $2,369 million during 2011 compared with $4,831 million used during 2010, primarily due to lower investments in time deposits during 2011. In 2011, capital expenditures totaled $1,713 million up from $1,125 million in 2010. Capital spending in 2011 is higher than 2010 due to the construction of a 787 final assembly factory and related site buildings in North Charleston, South Carolina, higher spending to support commercial airplane production rate increases and capital improvements. We expect capital expenditures to be higher in 2012 due to continued investment to ramp up commercial production rates. Expenditures on acquisitions totaled $42 million, down from $932 million in 2010 which included the acquisition of Argon ST, Inc. for $782 million. Financing Activities Cash used by financing activities totaled $1,700 million during 2011 compared with $1,962 million used during 2010 as proceeds from new borrowings of $799 million in 2011 more than offset $314 million of higher repayments of distribution rights financing and $241 million of higher debt repayments. In 2011, net proceeds from BCC borrowings amounted to $745 million and we repaid $930 million of debt, including repayments of $798 million of debt held at BCC. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the 38 Table of Contents recorded balance of debt was $12,371 million and $12,421 million, of which $2,353 million and $948 million were classified as short-term. This includes $3,400 million and $3,446 million of debt recorded at BCC, of which $879 million and $801 million were classified as short-term. In 2011 and 2010, we had 350,778 and 494,939 shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholding and did not repurchase any shares through our open market share repurchase program. During 2009, cash used in our open market share repurchase program totaled $50 million. Capital Resources We have substantial borrowing capacity. Any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. We and BCC have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short-term liquidity. Throughout 2011 and at December 31, 2011, neither we nor BCC had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding. Currently, we have $4,600 million ($1,500 million exclusively available for BCC) of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements. We anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support possible commercial paper borrowings. Financing commitments totaled $15,866 million and $9,865 million as of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010. We anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. Historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. In the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. We believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. However, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, our pension plans were $16,600 million and $9,854 million underfunded as measured under GAAP. On an ERISA basis our plans were approximately 99% funded at December 31, 2011 with minimal required contributions in 2012. We expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $1,500 million in 2012. We may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years. As of December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. The most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). When considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity. 39 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of December 31, 2011, and the estimated timing thereof. (Dollars in millions) Total Less than 1year 1-3 years 3-5 years After 5years Long-term debt (including current portion) $ 12,158 $ 2,257 $ 2,563 $ 1,864 $ 5,474 Interest on debt(1) 6,433 584 893 737 4,219 Pension and other postretirement cash requirements 27,778 612 4,503 8,827 13,836 Capital lease obligations 235 99 118 17 1 Operating lease obligations 1,311 202 333 180 596 Purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 106,235 36,589 37,591 21,749 10,306 Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position 14,153 13,432 699 4 18 Total contractual obligations $ 168,303 $ 53,775 $ 46,700 $ 33,378 $ 34,450 (1) Includes interest on variable rate debt calculated based on interest rates at December 31, 2011. Variable rate debt was approximately 1% of our total debt at December 31, 2011. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits Pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to ERISA regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. Estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts. Purchase Obligations Purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Approximately 6% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts. Purchase Obligations Not Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Production related purchase obligations not recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. The most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. We have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. In addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. These agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. The need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. A significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. These amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. Some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. In these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above. 40 Table of Contents Purchase Obligations Recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position Purchase obligations recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation. Industrial Participation Agreements We have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the U.S. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. These commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. However, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-U.S. customers. We do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. In certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. During 2011, we incurred no such penalties. As of December 31, 2011, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $11.1 billion that extend through 2024. Purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. To be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule. Income Tax Obligations As of December 31, 2011, our net asset for income taxes receivable, including uncertain tax positions, was $179 million. We are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. Our income tax matters are excluded from the table above. See Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Commercial Commitments The following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of December 31, 2011. (Dollars in millions) Total AmountsCommitted/MaximumAmount of Loss Less than1 year 1-3years 4-5years After 5years Standby letters of credit and surety bonds $ 6,199 $ 4,693 $ 1,064 $ 304 $ 138 Commercial aircraft financing commitments 15,866 1,562 3,424 6,114 4,766 Total commercial commitments $ 22,065 $ 6,255 $ 4,488 $ 6,418 $ 4,904 Commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to provide financing related to aircraft on order, under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest potential funding dates. Based on historical experience, we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments. However, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. See Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Contingent Obligations We have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following: Legal Various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. Legal contingencies are discussed in Note 21 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, including our contesting the default termination of the A-12 aircraft, certain employment, labor and benefits litigation, litigation/arbitration involving Boeing Satellite Systems International, Inc. programs and civil securities litigation relating to disclosures concerning the 787 program. 41 Table of Contents Environmental Remediation We are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $758 million at December 31, 2011. For additional information, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Taxes We have recorded a liability of $939 million at December 31, 2011 for uncertain tax positions. For further discussion of these contingencies, see Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. For discussion of these arrangements, see Note 13 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Critical Accounting Policies Contract Accounting We use contract accounting to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit for almost all of our BDS business. Contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. For each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. Due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these contracts are with the U.S. government. Generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. Changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contract’s inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately as a charge to earnings. For the years ending December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all BDS contracts increased operating earnings by $229 million, $125 million and $29 million respectively. Significant adjustments recorded during the three years ended December 31, 2011 relate to reach-forward losses on the AEW&C and the KC-767 International Tanker programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margin for all contracts in BDS for all of 2011 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $320 million. In addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. Changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings. 42 Table of Contents Program Accounting Program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. For each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. Factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs. Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. The sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates, consistent with typical sales contract terms. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends. To ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. Changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity. The program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. Because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs. Due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. If combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs, excluding the 747 and 787 programs, for all of 2011 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $276 million. The 747 program is in a reach-forward loss position having recorded a total of $2,037 million of reach-forward losses in 2009 and 2008. Absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs, subsequent deliveries are recorded at zero margin. Reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately. Any such increases could result in additional charges. The 787 program has a low single digit profit margin. The cumulative impacts of the production challenges, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts continue to place significant pressure 43 Table of Contents on revenues, costs and the profitability of the 787 program. The scale and duration of the 787 program is such that relatively minor changes in assumptions or variables could have a material effect on our reported results in any period if the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss. Aircraft Valuation Allowance for Losses on Customer Financing Receivables The allowance for losses on customer financing receivables (valuation provision) is used to provide for potential impairment of customer financing receivables in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the customer financing receivables portfolio. The estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors, including historical loss experience, collateral values, and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews. The adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly. Three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings, collateral values and default rates. If each customer’s credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at December 31, 2011, the allowance would have decreased by $41 million or increased by $107 million. If the collateral values were 20% higher or lower at December 31, 2011, the allowance would have decreased by $24 million or increased by $21 million. If the cumulative default rates used for each rating category increased or decreased 1%, the allowance would have increased or decreased by $7 million. Impairment Review for Assets Under Operating Leases and Held for Re-Lease We evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value. We use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. When we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset. Had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been 10% lower, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $10 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. Residual Values Equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight-line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease. Estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases and assets held for re-lease. If the estimated residual values declined 20% at December 31, 2011, we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, and a future cumulative pre-tax earnings reduction of approximately $106 million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods, of which approximately $11 million would be recognized in 2012. Our investment in sales-type/finance leases includes future minimum lease payments receivable plus the estimated residual value of leased assets less unearned income. Declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other than temporary are recognized in the period in which the decline occurs. If the estimated residual values declined 20% at December 31, 2011, we estimate that we would have reduced pre-tax income by $48 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. 44 Table of Contents Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Impairments Goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment, and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist. April 1 is our annual testing date. We test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. If the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. In this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. The shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment. We estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. Forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, and general market conditions. Changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any. The cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. Therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any. We completed our assessment of goodwill as of April 1, 2011 and determined that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. Changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. A 10% decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations would have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $497 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the Jeppesen and Aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. We test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and tradenames. Any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. A 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would reduce the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets by less than $1 million. Postretirement Plans The majority of our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans. All nonunion and some union employees hired after December 31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. We also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets. These measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend rate (rate of growth for medical costs). Future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligations and Shareholders’ equity. 45 Table of Contents The following table shows the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of December 31, 2011. (Dollars in millions) Change in discount rateIncrease 25 bps Change in discount rateDecrease 25 bps Pension plans Projected benefit obligation $ (2,108 ) $ 2,684 Net periodic pension cost (220 ) 280 Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (173 ) 203 Net periodic postretirement benefit cost (13 ) 15 Pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. A decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2011 net periodic pension expense by $124 million. We expect 2012 net periodic pension cost to increase by approximately $700 million and the portion recognized in earnings for 2012 to increase by approximately $1.0 billion primarily due to a reduction in the discount rate from 5.3% at December 31, 2010 to 4.4% at December 31, 2011 and amortization of actuarial losses. Absent increases in interest rates, higher asset values and/or higher contributions, net periodic pension cost will increase further in future years. The assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following year’s expense, recorded liabilities and Shareholders’ equity. The following table shows the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a 100 basis point change as of December 31, 2011. (Dollars in millions) Change in medical trend rateIncrease 100 bps Change in medical trend rateDecrease 100 bps Other postretirement benefit plans Accumulated postretirement benefit obligation $ 642 $ (572 ) Net periodic postretirement benefit cost 127 (111 ) 46 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk Interest Rate Risk We have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. Additionally, BCC uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. Exposure to this risk is managed by generally matching the profile of BCC’s liabilities with that of BCC’s assets in relation to amount and terms such as expected maturities and fixed versus floating interest rates. As of December 31, 2011, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point immediate and sustained rise or fall in interest rates would be a $10 million increase or a $1 million decrease to BCC’s pre-tax earnings. For purposes of the foregoing sensitivity analysis, we assume that the level of our floating rate assets and debt (including the impact of derivatives) remain unchanged from year-end 2011 and that they are all subject to immediate re-pricing. Historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our investments or customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. Based on the portfolio of other Boeing fixed-rate debt, the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material. The investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. Therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Risk We are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. We use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. Foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. At December 31, 2011, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by $220 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by $248 million. Consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. When taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk. 47 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:23:39.041713
