Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion contains trend information and other forward-looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements such as those made in “Overview” regarding growth for CMOS image sensor and NAND Flash markets and allocation of wafer starts to products other than Core DRAM; “Net Sales” regarding future megabit production growth, 300mm wafer production and increases in revenue from sales of DDR2 products, CMOS image sensors, PSRAM products and Flash memory products; “Gross Margin” regarding manufacturing cost reductions in future periods; in “Income Taxes” regarding future provisions for income taxes and in “Liquidity and Capital Resources” regarding capital spending in 2006. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from the Company’s historical results and those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, those identified in “Certain Factors.” This discussion should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes for the year ended September 1, 2005. All period references are to the Company’s fiscal periods unless otherwise indicated. All per share amounts are presented on a diluted basis. All tabular dollar amounts are in millions. Unless otherwise stated, all production data reflects production of the Company and its TECH joint venture. Overview The Company is a global manufacturer of semiconductor devices, principally DRAM, NAND Flash, and CMOS image sensors. Its products are used in a broad range of electronic applications including personal computers, workstations, network servers, mobile phones and other consumer applications including flash memory cards, USB storage devices, digital still camera and MP3 players. The Company’s customers are principally original equipment manufacturers located around the world. The Company’s success is largely dependent on the market acceptance of a diversified semiconductor product portfolio, efficient utilization of the Company’s manufacturing infrastructure, successful ongoing development of advanced process technologies and generation of sufficient return on research and development efforts. The Company has strategically diversified its business by expanding into semiconductor products such as specialty memory products (including SDRAM, PSRAM, mobile SDRAM and reduced latency DRAM), NAND Flash memory products and CMOS image sensors. These products are used in a wider range of applications than the computing applications that use the Company’s standardized DRAM products. The Company leverages its expertise in semiconductor memory manufacturing and product and process technology to provide these products that are differentiated from competitors’ products based on performance characteristics. In the fourth quarter of 2005, specialty memory products, NAND Flash products and CMOS image sensors were over 45% of the Company’s net sales. The Company expects that the markets for these products will grow more rapidly than the overall semiconductor market in the near term. The Company’s products have been well received in these growing customer applications. The Company plans to allocate an increasing portion of its manufacturing capacity to support these products and expand its market position in 2006. The Company believes that the strategic diversification of its product portfolio will strengthen its ability to allocate manufacturing resources to obtain the highest rate of return. The Company makes significant ongoing investments to implement its proprietary product and process technology in its manufacturing facilities in the United States, Europe and Asia to provide semiconductor products with increasing functionality and performance at lower costs. The Company introduces new generations of products that offer improved performance characteristics, such as higher data transfer rates, reduced package size, lower power consumption and increased megapixel count. The Company generally reduces the manufacturing cost of each generation of product through its advanced product and process technology such as its leading-edge line width process technology and innovative array architecture. In order to maximize returns from investments in research and development (“R&D”), the Company develops process technology that effectively reduces production costs and leverages the Company’s capital expenditures. To be successfully incorporated in customers’ end products, the Company must offer qualified semiconductor solutions at a time when customers are developing their design specifications for their end products. This is especially true for specialty memory products and CMOS image sensors which are required to demonstrate advanced functionality and performance well ahead of a planned ramp of production to commercial volumes. In addition, DRAM and NAND Flash products often incorporate highly advanced design and process technologies that are difficult to manufacture. The Company must make significant investments in R&D to expand its product offering and develop its leading-edge product and process technologies. 13 Results of Operations 2005 2004 2003 (amounts in millions and as a percent of net sales) Net sales $ 4,880.2 100.0 % $ 4,404.2 100.0 % $ 3,091.3 100.0 % Gross margin 1,145.8 23.5 % 1,314.7 29.9 % (20.7 ) (0.7 )% Selling, general and administrative 348.3 7.1 % 332.0 7.5 % 358.2 11.6 % Research and development 603.7 12.4 % 754.9 17.1 % 656.4 21.2 % Restructure and other charges (1.4 ) (0.0 )% (22.5 ) (0.5 )% 116.3 3.8 % Operating income (loss) 217.5 4.5 % 249.7 5.7 % (1,186.5 ) (38.4 )% The Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period ending on the Thursday closest to August 31. The Company’s fiscal 2005 and 2003 contained 52 weeks. The Company’s fiscal 2004 contained 53 weeks. Net Sales Net sales for 2005 increased by 11% as compared to 2004 primarily due to a 40% increase in megabits of memory sold, partially offset by a 24% decrease in the overall average selling price per megabit for the Company’s memory products. Net sales for 2005 also benefited from an increase of approximately $200 million in sales of CMOS image sensors. The Company’s overall megabit production in 2005 increased by 48% as compared to 2004, principally due to a steep ramp in 300mm wafer production and gains in manufacturing efficiencies realized from improvements in product and process technologies. The Company realized a significant increase in 300mm wafer production in 2005, achieving its initial target of 5,000 wafer outs per week in the fourth quarter. The Company expects that its 300mm wafer production will continue to increase in 2006. The Company’s megabit production exceeded megabit sales in 2005, which resulted in an approximate 170% increase in megabit finished goods inventories, primarily consisting of DDR and DDR2 products. The increase in inventories was largely the result of a slower than previously expected industry-wide transition to DDR2 memory products. Most of the increase in sales in 2005 as compared to 2004 resulted from sales of the Company’s emerging specialty memory products, such as pseudo-static RAM (“PSRAM”) and mobile DRAM products, CMOS image sensors and NAND Flash memory. The Company’s combined revenue from these products was $811.9 million in 2005 and quadrupled from 2004 due to large increases in production and strong demand for the Company’s offerings in these product groups. The Company expects that its revenue from these products will continue to grow rapidly in 2006 as it allocates increasing manufacturing resources to these product groups. DDR and DDR2 product sales in 2005 increased 12% from 2004 and were 59% of the Company’s net sales in 2005. Sales of DDR2 products increased to 14% of the Company’s net sales in 2005 from 1% of net sales in 2004. The Company expects that sales of DDR2 products will continue to increase in 2006 as market demand continues to shift from DDR products to more advanced DDR2 products. Net sales for 2004 increased by 42% as compared to 2003 primarily due to a 20% increase in megabits sold and a 16% increase in average per megabit selling prices for the Company’s memory products as a result of generally improved market conditions. During 2004, the Company increased its allocation of manufacturing capacity to specialty memory products and CMOS image sensors. The shift in product mix contributed to the increase in average per megabit selling prices for 2004 as specialty memory products on average had higher selling prices per megabit than the Company’s DDR and DDR2 products. The Company’s overall megabit production for 2004 increased approximately 23% from 2003 primarily due to manufacturing efficiencies. The growth rate in megabit production for 2004 was partially mitigated by the allocation of wafers to CMOS image sensors and specialty memory products. Gross Margin The Company’s gross margin percentage for 2005 declined to 24% as compared to 30% for 2004. This decline in gross margin was primarily due to the 24% decrease in the Company’s overall average selling price per megabit of memory and, to a lesser extent, a shift in product mix from DDR to DDR2 products which had lower margins in 2005. Partially offsetting this decline in gross margin from 2005 to 2004 was a reduction in cost of goods sold per megabit and the increase in sales of CMOS image sensors, specialty memory and NAND Flash products, which had significantly higher margins than DDR and DDR2 products. The Company’s overall cost of goods sold per megabit in 2005 declined from 2004 primarily due to manufacturing improvements. The Company reduced product costs through manufacturing efficiencies achieved from improved product yield and increase in production utilizing the Company’s 110nm process technology and 6F² technology. The cost per megabit for 14 products manufactured on 300mm wafers decreased significantly in 2005 compared to 2004 as the Company continued to increase 300mm wafer production, reaching its initial target of 5,000 wafer outs per week. Manufacturing costs per megabit for DDR2 products were higher than the Company’s DDR products in 2005 because of DDR2’s relatively larger die size. The Company expects that per megabit cost reductions in 2006 will continue to be mitigated by shifts in product mix from DDR to DDR2. The Company’s gross margin percentage for 2004 improved to 30% from a negative 1% for 2003 primarily due to the 16% increase in average per megabit selling prices and reduced costs per megabit. In addition, compared to 2003, gross margin for 2004 benefited from relatively higher margins on sales of products purchased from the Company’s TECH joint venture. The Company reduced its overall average cost per megabit for 2004 as compared to 2003 through manufacturing efficiencies achieved by improving product yields and continuing its transition to products utilizing 110nm process technology and 6F² technology. Inventory write-downs: In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the Company recorded $307.0 million of charges to cost of goods sold in 2003 to write down the carrying values of work in process and finished goods inventories to their estimated market values. As these charges were recorded in advance of when inventory subject to the write-down was sold, gross margins in the period of sale were higher than they would be absent the effect of the previous write-downs. The Company did not record any charges for inventory write-downs in 2005 and 2004. Costs of goods sold in 2004 were $61.0 million lower than they otherwise would have been as a result of write-downs in prior periods. Costs of goods sold in 2003 were $174.9 million lower than they otherwise would have been as a result of write-downs in prior periods net of the write-downs in 2003. TECH Semiconductor Singapore Pte. Ltd. (“TECH”): The Company’s TECH joint venture supplied approximately 25%, 30% and 30% of the total megabits of memory produced by the Company in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The Company generally purchases memory products from TECH at prices determined quarterly, based on a discount from average selling prices realized by the Company for the immediately preceding quarter. Depending on market conditions, the gross margin from the sale of products manufactured by TECH may be higher or lower than the gross margin from the sale of products manufactured by the Company’s wholly-owned operations. In 2005, the Company realized gross margin percentages on sales of TECH products that were approximately the same as for the DDR and DDR2 products manufactured by its wholly-owned operations. In 2004 and 2003, the Company realized higher gross margin percentages on sales of TECH products than for products manufactured by its wholly-owned operations. Selling, General and Administrative Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses for 2005 increased 5% from 2004 primarily due to higher compensation costs, partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with legal matters. SG&A expenses for 2004 were 7% lower than for 2003 primarily due to lower costs associated with outstanding legal matters and reduced depreciation costs, partially offset by higher levels of performance-based compensation expense and other personnel costs. Research and Development R&D expenses vary primarily with the number of development wafers processed, the cost of advanced equipment dedicated to new product and process development, and personnel costs. Because of the lead times necessary to manufacture its products, the Company typically begins to process wafers before completion of performance and reliability testing. The Company deems development of a product complete once the product has been thoroughly reviewed and tested for performance and reliability. R&D expenses can vary significantly depending on the timing of product qualification. R&D expenses for 2005 decreased 20% from 2004 principally because products were qualified on the 300mm wafer fabrication process in the first quarter of 2005. When products are qualified, the Company includes costs from the production of these products in inventory and costs of goods sold rather than research and development expense. Higher compensation costs partially offset the decreases in R&D expenses for 2005 as compared to 2004. R&D expenses for 2004 increased 15% from 2003 principally due to an increase in development wafers processed during 2004 as the Company increased its product diversification and ramped production at its 300mm wafer fabrication facility, which primarily ran development wafers in 2004. Higher R&D costs in 2004 as compared to 2003 also reflected a higher level of expenses related to CMOS image sensors, Flash memory and specialty memory products. The Company’s process technology R&D efforts are focused primarily on development of 95nm, 78nm, 65nm and smaller DRAM and 90nm, 72nm, 50nm and smaller NAND Flash line-width process technologies, which are designed to facilitate the Company’s transition to next generation products. Additional R&D efforts include process development to support the Company’s 300mm 15 wafer manufacturing, NAND Flash memory, CMOS image sensors, specialty memory products (including PSRAM, mobile SDRAM and reduced latency DRAM) and new manufacturing materials. Efforts toward the design and development of new products are concentrated on the Company’s 1 Gig and 2 Gig DDR, DDR2 and DDR3 products as well as high density and mobile NAND Flash memory, CMOS image sensors and specialty memory products. Restructure and Other Charges In 2003, the Company announced a series of cost-reduction initiatives. The restructure plan included the shutdown of the Company’s 200mm production line in Virginia; the discontinuance of certain memory products, including SRAM and TCAM; and an approximate 10% reduction in the Company’s worldwide workforce. In 2003, the Company recorded restructure charges of $109.2 million and other restructure-related charges of $7.1 million, including $50.7 million of equipment write-downs, $26.3 million of severance and other termination benefits and $18.6 million of intangible asset write downs. The Company recorded net credits to restructure of $1.4 million and $22.5 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, primarily from sales of equipment associated with the Company’s 200mm production line in Virginia. The Company substantially completed the restructure plan and paid essentially all costs associated with the restructure plan in 2004 and 2003. Stock-Based Compensation In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (“SFAS”) No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” SFAS No. 123(R) will require the Company to use a fair-value based method of accounting for share-based compensation beginning in 2006. Through 2005 the Company used the intrinsic-value method to account for stock-based compensation and generally no compensation costs were recorded. Accordingly, the Company’s implementation of SFAS No. 123(R) will increase compensation costs reflected in cost of goods sold, SG&A and R&D in the consolidated statement of operations for future periods. In April of 2005, the Company accelerated the vesting of approximately 44.6 million unvested stock options outstanding under the Company’s stock plans to reduce compensation costs that would have been recognized in the Company’s consolidated financial statements after 2005 with the adoption of SFAS 123(R) by approximately $100 million. As of September 1, 2005, 3% of the Company’s then outstanding stock options were unvested and the expense for these unvested stock options to be recorded in 2006 through 2009 is $10.4 million. Because the Company’s near-term, stock-based compensation costs were reduced by the acceleration of vesting, share-based compensation costs could grow significantly in future periods if the Company continues to grant amounts of new share-based compensation awards similar to recent periods. Other Operating (Income) Expense, Net Other operating income for 2005 includes net gains on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $12.7 million and $12.0 million in receipts from the U.S. government in connection with anti-dumping tariffs. Other operating expense for 2004 includes losses of $17.2 million from changes in currency exchange rates. Other operating income for 2004 includes $7.2 million from the Commonwealth of Virginia for meeting investment commitments at the Virginia wafer fabrication facility and net gains of $3.9 million on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment. Other operating expense for 2003 includes net losses on write-downs and disposals of semiconductor equipment of $41.5 million and losses of $10.7 million from changes in currency exchange rates. Other operating expense for 2003 is net of $14.4 million in receipts from the U.S. government in connection with anti-dumping tariffs. The Company estimates that, based on its assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than U.S. dollar as of September 1, 2005, a 1% change in the exchange rate versus the U.S. dollar would result in foreign currency gains or losses of approximately $1 million for the yen and $1 million for the euro. Income Taxes Income taxes for 2005, 2004 and 2003 primarily reflect taxes on the Company’s non-U.S. operations. The Company has a valuation allowance for its net deferred tax asset associated with its U.S. operations. The provision for taxes on U.S. operations in 2005 and 2004 was substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance. Until such time as the Company utilizes its U.S. net operating loss carryforwards and unused tax credits, the provision for taxes on the Company’s U.S. operations is expected to be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance. As of September 1, 2005, the Company had aggregate U.S. tax net operating loss carryforwards of $2.5 billion and unused U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $140.7 million. The Company also has unused state tax net operating loss carryforwards of $1.7 billion and unused state tax credits of $137.5 million. Substantially all of the net operating loss carryforwards expire in 2022 to 2025 and substantially all of the tax credit carryforwards expire in 2013 to 2025. 16 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company’s liquidity is highly dependent on average selling prices for its semiconductor memory products and the timing of capital expenditures, both of which can vary significantly from period to period. As of September 1, 2005, the Company had cash and marketable investment securities totaling $1,290.4 million compared to $1,231.0 million as of September 2, 2004. Operating Activities: For 2005, net cash provided by operating activities was $1,237.8 million, which principally reflects the Company’s $188.0 million of net income adjusted by $1,264.5 million for non-cash depreciation and amortization expense. Cash provided by operations was reduced by a $193.3 million increase in inventories. The increase in inventories was largely the result of a slower than previously expected industry-wide transition to DDR2 memory products. Investing Activities: For 2005, net cash used by investing activities was $1,083.9 million, which included cash expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $1,064.8 million. The Company believes that to develop new product and process technologies, support future growth, achieve operating efficiencies and maintain product quality, it must continue to invest in manufacturing technologies, facilities and capital equipment, research and development, and product and process technologies. The Company projects 2006 capital spending of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion. As of September 1, 2005, the Company had commitments extending into 2007 of approximately $250 million for the acquisition of property, plant and equipment. Financing Activities: For 2005, net cash used by financing activities was $115.5 million. Payments on debt were $300.0 million for 2005, and included prepayment of the $210.0 million outstanding on the Company’s subordinated notes that were due September 2005. Payments on equipment purchase contracts were $236.0 million for 2005. In the third quarter of 2005, the Company obtained an aggregate of 23.5 billion yen ($221.4 million) from two yen-denominated loan financing arrangements that are payable in semi-annual installments through 2010. In 2005, the Company received $161.3 million in proceeds from sales-leaseback transactions which are payable in periodic installments through January 2009. In 2004, the Company received $450.0 million from Intel in exchange for stock rights exchangeable into approximately 33.9 million shares of the Company’s common stock. Additionally, the Company agreed to achieve operational objectives or be subject to monetary penalties. The Company has achieved operational objectives and does not expect to make any payments to Intel under this agreement. Access to capital markets has historically been important to the Company. Depending on market conditions, the Company may, from time to time, issue registered or unregistered securities to raise capital to fund a portion of its operations. As of September 1, 2005, the Company had $632.5 million of 2.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes (the “Notes”) outstanding. Holders of the Notes may convert all or some of their Notes at any time prior to maturity, unless previously redeemed or repurchased, into the Company’s common stock at a conversion rate of 84.8320 shares for each $1,000 principal amount of the Notes. This conversion rate is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $11.79 per share. The Company may redeem the Notes at any time after February 6, 2006, at declining premiums to par. Contractual Obligations: The following table summarizes the Company’s significant contractual obligations at September 1, 2005, and the effect such obligations are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and cash flows in future periods. Total Less than 1 year 1-3 years 3-5 years More than 5 years (amounts in millions) Notes payable $ 980.0 $ 93.4 $ 153.3 $ 728.4 $ 4.9 Capital lease obligations 221.4 64.3 99.3 57.8 — Operating leases 60.8 18.1 14.0 5.5 23.2 Purchase obligations 409.7 394.5 15.0 0.2 — Other long-term liabilities 125.6 — 63.8 12.2 49.6 Total $ 1,797.5 $ 570.3 $ 345.4 $ 804.1 $ 77.7 The obligations disclosed above do not include contractual obligations recorded on the Company’s balance sheet as current liabilities except for the current portion of long-term debt. The expected timing of payment amounts of the obligations 17 discussed above is estimated based on current information. Timing and actual amounts paid may differ depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services, market prices or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations. Purchase obligations include all commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity that meet any of the following criteria: (1) they are noncancelable, (2) the Company would incur a penalty if the agreement was cancelled, or (3) the Company must make specified minimum payments even if it does not take delivery of the contracted products or services (“take-or-pay”). If the obligation to purchase goods or services is noncancelable, the entire value of the contract was included in the above table. If the obligation is cancelable, but the Company would incur a penalty if cancelled, the dollar amount of the penalty was included as a purchase obligation. Contracted minimum amounts specified in take-or-pay contracts are also included in the above table as they represent the portion of each contract that is a firm commitment. The Company has an agreement with its TECH joint venture to purchase all of TECH’s output of semiconductor memory components subject to specific terms and conditions. As the purchase quantities are based on qualified production output, the agreement does not contain a fixed or minimum purchase quantity and therefore the Company did not include the agreement in its purchase obligations. In addition to purchase quantities, the TECH purchase obligation fluctuates based on average selling prices for semiconductor memory components which can change significantly from period to period. In 2005, the net cost of semiconductor components purchased from TECH was $651.9 million. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of September 1, 2005, the Company had the following off-balance sheet arrangements: convertible debt, call spread options, stock warrants and its variable interest in the TECH joint venture. See “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” for a description of the Company’s convertible debt. Concurrent with the issuance of the Notes, the Company purchased call spread options (the “Call Spread Options”) covering 53.7 million shares of the Company’s common stock, which is the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes in full. The Call Spread Options have a lower strike price of $11.79, a higher strike price of $18.19, may be settled at the Company’s option either in cash or net shares and expire on January 29, 2008. Settlement of the Call Spread Options in cash on January 29, 2008, would result in the Company receiving an amount ranging from zero if the market price per share of the Company’s common stock is at or below $11.79 to a maximum of $343.4 million if the market price per share of the Company’s common stock is at or above $18.19. In 2001, the Company received $480.2 million from the issuance of warrants to purchase 29.1 million shares of the Company’s common stock. The warrants entitle the holders to exercise their warrants and purchase shares of Common Stock for $56.00 per share (the “Exercise Price”) at any time through May 15, 2008 (the “Expiration Date”). Warrants exercised prior to the Expiration Date will be settled on a “net share” basis, wherein investors receive common stock equal to the difference between $56.00 and the average closing sale price for the common shares over the 30 trading days immediately preceding the Exercise Date. At expiration, the Company may elect to settle the warrants on a net share basis or for cash, provided certain conditions are satisfied. As of September 1, 2005, there had been no exercises of warrants and all warrants issued remained outstanding. See “",2023-12-30 19:45:25.799555
