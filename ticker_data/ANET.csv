1596532,ANET,"Arista Networks, Inc.",2015,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewWe are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of large-scale Internet companies, cloud service providers and next-generation data centers for enterprises, based on market share. Our cloud networking solutions consist of our Extensible Operating System, or EOS, a set of network applications and our 10/40/100 Gigabit Ethernet switches. Our cloud networking solutions deliver industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility. At the core of our cloud networking platform is EOS, which was purpose-built to be fully programmable and highly modular. The programmability of EOS has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking, including workflow automation, network visibility and analytics, and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services.We were founded in 2004 to address the limitations of legacy networking products and to create a cloud networking platform that is open and programmable. From 2004 to 2008, our activities were focused on the development of our software, which resulted in the commercial release of our first product, the 7100 Series switches based on our EOS software, in 2008. Since then, we have continued to introduce new products utilizing EOS, including our 7500 Series switch and our 7050 Series switch in 2010, the second generation of our 7500 Series switch, called the 7500E modular switch, in May 2013, our 7300 Series switch in November 2013, our 7280E in July 2014 and in December 2014 our EOS+ software platform for networking programmability and automation. As of December 31, 2014, we have shipped more than three million switch ports. We have experienced rapid revenue growth over the last several years, increasing our revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 68.9% from 2010 to 2014. As we have grown the functionality of our EOS software, expanded the range of our switching portfolio and increased the size of our sales force, our revenue has continued to grow rapidly. To support revenue growth, we have increased our international presence to include offices in 11 countries as of December 31, 2014, including Australia, Canada, China, India, Ireland, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan and the United Kingdom. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $584.1 million an increase of 61.7% compared to 2013. We have been profitable and cash flow positive for each year since 2010.We believe that our cloud networking platform addresses the large and growing cloud networking segment of data center switching, which remains in the early stage of adoption. We expect to continue rapidly growing our organization to meet the needs of new and existing customers as they increasingly realize the performance and cost benefits of our cloud networking solutions and as they expand their cloud networks. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications. By investing in research and development, we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity. We also intend to continue expanding our sales and marketing teams and programs, with a particular focus on expanding our network of international channel partners and carrying out associated marketing activities in key geographies. In order to support our strong growth, we have accelerated our investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations. As a result, our levels of operating profit as a percentage of revenue could decline in the short to medium term. For a description of factors that may impact our future performance, see the disclosure in the section titled ""Factors Affecting Our Performance"" below.43Our Business ModelWe derive revenue from sales of products and services. We generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our EOS software. We generate the majority of our services revenue from post contract support, or PCS, which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products.Since shipping our first products in 2008, our cumulative end-customer base has grown rapidly. Between December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2014, our cumulative end-customer base grew from approximately 570 to over 3,000. Our end customers span a range of industries and include large Internet companies, service providers, financial services organizations, government agencies, media and entertainment companies and others.To continue to grow our revenue, it is important that we both obtain new customers and sell additional products to existing customers. Our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our EOS software and enhancements to EOS. We engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture. Today, we combine our EOS software with merchant silicon into a family of switching products. This enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions. We currently procure certain merchant silicon components from multiple vendors, and we continue to expand our relationships with these and other vendors. We work closely with third parties to manufacture and deliver our products. Our third-party silicon vendors deliver these components to one of three direct fulfillment facilities where our EOS software is installed on our products, and then delivered to us for labeling, quality assurance testing, final configuration and shipment to our customers.We market and sell our products through our direct sales force and in partnership with channel partners, including distributors, value-added resellers, systems integrators, original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, partners and in conjunction with various technology partners, depending on the application. To facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity, we have created a partner program, the Arista Partner Program, to engage partners who provide value-added services and extend our reach into the marketplace. Authorized training partners provide technical training to our channel partners. Our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us, and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders. Our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us. Our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for pre-sales technical support and engineering for our end customers. Each sales team is responsible for a geographic territory, has responsibility for a number of major direct end-customer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market. During years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, 79.7%, 82.9% and 79.9% of our revenue was generated from the Americas, substantially all from the U.S., 12.8%, 11.2% and 11.9% from Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 7.5%, 5.9% and 8.2% from the Asia-Pacific region, respectively.Factors Affecting Our PerformanceWe believe that our future success will depend on many factors, including our ability to expand sales to our existing customers as well as to add new end customers. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results. See the section titled “Risk Factors.” Additionally, we face intense competition especially from larger, well-established companies, and we must continue to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform to succeed in our market. If we are unable to address these challenges, our business could be adversely affected.Increasing Adoption of Cloud Networks. Networks are subject to increasing performance requirements due to growing numbers of connected devices as well as new enterprise and consumer applications. Computing architectures are evolving to meet the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications. We believe that cloud networks will continue to replace legacy network technologies. Our business and results of operations will be significantly affected by the speed with which organizations implement cloud networks.Expanding Sales to Existing Customer Base. We expect that a substantial portion of our future sales will be follow-on sales to existing end customers. As noted above, one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our cloud networking solutions, thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers. We believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing and expected infrastructure spend. As of December 31, 2014, our end customers that have been with us for at least 2 years, on average made additional purchases that were approximately 11.9x more than the initial dollar amount of purchases made in the first two quarters of their purchasing history. The first 2 quarters of purchasing are typically the beginning of switch procurement for a given deployment and typically do not include time spent during initial customer testing, as most customer testing is done prior to initial purchase. Although the additional purchases for our Top 10 end customers were significantly more than our overall average, the remainder of the end customer base also showed a propensity to continue purchasing with average additional purchases of 6.7x the initial dollar purchases made in the first two quarters of their purchasing history. This analysis is based on billings, which represent amounts invoiced to customers for products shipped, or for services rendered or to be rendered, and that the vast majority of billings for any given period represent revenue, and to a far lesser extent deferred revenue. Our business and results of operations will depend on our ability to sell additional products to our growing base of customers.44Adding New End Customers. We believe that the cloud networking market is still in the early stages of adoption. We intend to target new end customers by continuing to invest in our field sales force and extending our relationships with channel partners. To date, we have primarily targeted end customers with the largest cloud data centers. A typical initial order involves the education of prospective customers about the technical merits and capabilities and potential cost savings of our products as compared to our competitors’ products. Our results of operations will depend on our ability to continue to add new customers. We believe that customer references have been, and will continue to be, an important factor in winning new business.Selling More Complex and Higher-Performance Configurations. Our results of operations have been, and we believe will continue to be, affected by our ability to sell more complex and higher-performance configurations of our products. Going forward, we aim to grow our revenue by enabling end customers to transition from previously deployed 1 Gigabit Ethernet switches to 10, 40 and eventually 100 Gigabit Ethernet switches. Our ability to sustain our revenue growth will depend, in part, upon our continued sales of more robust configurations of our products, and quarterly results of operations can be significantly impacted by the mix of products and product configurations sold during the period.Leveraging Channel Partners. We expect to continue to derive a growing portion of our sales through our channel partners as they develop new end customers and expand sales to our existing end customers. We plan to continue to invest in our network of channel partners to empower them to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support effectively. We believe that increasing channel leverage will extend and improve our engagement with a broad set of customers. Our business and results of operations will be materially affected by our success in leveraging our channel partners.Investing in Research and Development for Growth. We believe that the market for cloud networking is still in the early stages of adoption and we intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products including new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and new applications and build upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts. By investing in research and development, we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity. We expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these product development investments.Customer Concentration and Timing of Large Orders. Historically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for significant portion of our revenue. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, our largest end customer accounted for 14.9%, 21.9% and 15.3% of our revenue, respectively. We have also experienced and continue to experience customer concentration on a quarterly basis. In addition, we have experienced increases in the size of our orders, including orders from existing customers, which could result in future increased customer concentration, depending on the timing of the fulfillment of those orders. We have also experienced unpredictability in the timing of large orders, especially with respect to our large end customers, due to the complexity of orders, the time it takes end customers to evaluate, test, qualify and accept our products and factors specific to our end customers. Due to these factors, we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, we have provided, and may in the future provide, pricing discounts to large end customers, which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur. Our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers.45Basis of PresentationRevenueWe generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our EOS software. We also derive a small but growing portion of our revenue from sales of PCS. We generate PCS revenue from sales of technical support services contracts that are typically purchased in conjunction with our products and subsequent renewals of those contracts. We offer PCS services under renewable, fee-based contracts, which include 24-hour technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts, bug fixes, patches and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if available basis. We expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing and size of orders, the delivery and acceptance of products, the impact of significant transactions with unique terms and conditions that may require deferral of revenue and cyclicality of orders being placed by our customers. Additionally, we expect our PCS revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our installed base. Our ability to expand our installed base and increase our revenue is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. See the section titled “Risk Factors.” We report revenue net of sales taxes.Cost of RevenueCost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our third-party contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors, overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department, and other manufacturing-related costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases. Cost of providing PCS services consists of personnel costs for our global customer support organization. We expect our cost of service revenue to increase as our PCS revenue increases.Gross MarginGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing, the average sales price of our offerings, manufacturing costs, merchant silicon costs and the mix of products sold. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time, depending on the factors described above and others. See Part I Item 1A, of “Risk Factors.”Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation and travel expenses. We expect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business.Research and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, with the remainder being prototype expenses, third-party engineering and contractor support costs, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs and depreciation. Our research and development efforts are focused on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development, including new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and applications. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership.Sales and Marketing ExpensesSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and also include costs related to marketing and promotional activities, with the remainder being an allocated portion of facility and IT costs and depreciation. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide and expand our relationships with current and future channel partners and end customers.General and Administrative ExpensesGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, professional fees, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs and depreciation. General and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive, finance, IT, human resources and legal functions. Our professional fees consist primarily of accounting, external legal and IT and other consulting costs. We expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars to support our growing infrastructure needs and as we assume the reporting requirements and compliance obligations of a public company. In addition, we expect an increase in legal expenses to address current and potential litigation claims.46Other Income (Expense), NetInterest Expense Interest expense consists of interest expense on our subordinated convertible promissory notes, including our related party subordinated convertible promissory notes which were converted during fiscal 2014 and interest expense from our lease financing obligation.Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) consists of gains on investments, write-offs of debt discount on notes payable and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Our foreign currency exchange gains and losses relate to transactions and asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Provision for Income TaxesWe operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to U.S. income tax. Generally, the U.S. taxes are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these earnings which avoids double taxation. Our tax expense to date consists of federal, state and foreign current and deferred income taxes. As we expand internationally, our marginal tax rate may decrease; however, there can be no certainty that our marginal tax rate will decrease, and we may experience changes in tax rates that are not reflective of actual changes in our business or operations.We account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements but have not been reflected in our taxable income. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. We measure deferred income tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize.We believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.47Results of OperationsThe following table summarizes historical results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of revenue for those periods. We have derived the data for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 from our consolidated financial statements (in thousands, except for percentage of revenue).

Revenue increased $222.9 million, or 61.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in revenue predominantly included an increase in sales of switch products and related accessories of $196.0 million, or 58.9%, primarily to existing customers. The increase in product revenue was largely driven by the number of switch ports shipped, which increased by 82.4% during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013, partially offset by a reduction of 15.0% in the average selling price per port shipped. The decrease in average selling price per port was primarily attributable to product mix and lower pricing terms for sales to large end customers. Our cumulative number of customers grew approximately 33% from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 as we continued to broaden our market penetration.Cost of Revenue. Cost of revenue increased $69.3 million, or 56.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to the corresponding increase in revenue as our shipment volume significantly increased during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulting in an increase in product costs of $62.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013. Gross Margin. Gross margin increased from 66.0% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 67.1% for 2014. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of a reduction in warranty and excess and obsolete inventory-related charges of $10.3 million due to significant product quality issues and inventory obsolescence charges that did not recur during 2014. These charges were partially offset by an increase in manufacturing overhead charges of $7.4 million to support our revenue growth. To a lesser extent, gross margin was negatively impacted by a decrease in product margins due to product mix and an increase in the size of orders with volume discounts.Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change in $ % ofrevenue $ % ofrevenue $ %Operating expenses: Research and development$148,909 25.5% $98,587 27.3% $50,322 51.0%Sales and marketing85,338 14.6 55,115 15.3 30,223 54.8General and administrative32,331 5.5 18,688 5.2 13,643 73.0Total operating expenses$266,578 45.6% $172,390 47.8% $94,188 54.6%Research and development. Research and development expenses increased $50.3 million, or 51.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $39.0 million, resulting from an increase of 156 employees (a 34.1% increase) from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014, and additional bonus expenses under our corporate bonus plan. The increase was also due to an increase of $6.6 million in research and development related facilities and IT infrastructure costs, and increases in third-party engineering costs of $5.9 million and depreciation expense of $2.0 million, as we continued to expand and support our research and development activities. These expenses were partially offset by a $4.3 million reduction in prototype spending related to project timing.49Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $30.2 million, or 54.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $23.4 million, resulting from an increase of 45 employees (a 23.0% increase) from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014, as well as an increase in sales commissions resulting from higher sales volume. The increase was also due to an increase of $3.7 million in product demonstrations, expenses incurred to expand our sales engineering labs to support our growing customer base, consulting expenses, and other marketing activities, and an increase in IT and infrastructure of $1.6 million.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $13.6 million, or 73.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $5.7 million, resulting from an increase of 17 employees (a 29.8% increase) from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014, and additional expenses under our corporate bonus plan. We also incurred higher professional service fees of $3.7 million related to outside legal, accounting and consulting services to support increased business activity, litigation and public-company activities. The increase was also attributable to higher insurance expense and property taxes of $1.5 million associated with being a public company, and a $1.0 million charitable donation through a fund established by the Company in 2014.Other Income (Expense), Net (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Change in 2014 2013 $ %Other income (expense), net: Interest expense$(6,280) $(7,119) $839 (11.8)%Other income (expense), net2,275 (754) 3,029 NMTotal other income (expense), net$(4,005) $(7,873) $3,868 (49.1)%Interest expense. Interest expense decreased during the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to the same period in 2013 as a result of repayment and conversion of our notes payable upon our IPO during the second quarter of 2014. Other income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net increased for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013 due to the gain on our notes receivable of $4.0 million offset by a $0.7 million write-off related to the debt discount on notes payable upon our IPO, further offset by net transactional exchange rate losses.Provision for Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Change in 2014 2013 $ %Provision for income taxes$34,658 $15,815 $18,843 119.1%Effective tax rate28.5% 27.1% Provision for income taxes. Provision for income taxes was approximately $34.7 million and $15.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Provision for income taxes increased $18.8 million, or 119.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The change in our provision for income taxes was primarily due to an increase in profit before income tax. The change in the effective tax rate was a result of the geographical distribution of the earnings, the federal research and development (""R&D"") tax credit for 2014 including only a current year benefit, as compared to a two-year federal R&D tax credit benefit for 2013, and an increase in state taxes.The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 included the impact of the reinstatement of the 2014 R&D credit. The impact of the 2014 federal R&D tax credit benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2014. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 included the impact of the reinstatement of the 2013 and 2012 federal R&D tax credits.

Revenue increased $167.8 million, or 86.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012. The increase in revenue predominantly included an increase in sales of switch products and related accessories of $153.2 million, or 85.3%, primarily to existing customers as these customers purchased our newer products to further evolve their data centers. Our revenue also increased to a lesser extent due to sales to new customers. The increase in product revenue was largely driven by number of switch ports shipped which increased by 109.2%, during 2013 compared to the prior year. This increase was partially offset by a reduction of 10% in the average selling price per port shipped. The decrease in the average selling price per port was primarily attributable to lower pricing terms for sales to our large end customers. Our cumulative number of customers grew approximately 43.2% from December 31, 2012 to December 31, 2013 as we continued to broaden our market penetration.Cost of revenue. Cost of revenue increased $61.4 million, or 100.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to the corresponding increase in revenue as our shipment volume significantly increased during the year ended December 31, 2013 resulting in an increase in product costs of $46.5 million in 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was also due to an increase of $1.8 million in excess and obsolete material charges for non-cancelable and non-returnable purchase commitments by our third-party contract manufacturers, as well as an increase in write-downs of excess and obsolete inventory of $2.1 million from the introduction of new products and product enhancements We also experienced an increase in manufacturing overhead costs of $4.3 million to support the growth in production during the year ended 2013.Gross margin. Gross margin decreased approximately two percentage points from 68.3% for the year ended December 31, 2012 to 66.0% for 2013. The decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase in excess and obsolete inventory and material charges noted above totaling $3.9 million, and an increase in manufacturing overhead costs of $4.3 million. The decrease was also due, to a lesser extent, to an increase in the size of contracts with large end customers with lower margins, which was partially offset by cost reductions primarily due to more favorable component pricing from our contract manufacturers as we increased volume.Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2013 2012 Change in $ % ofrevenue $ % ofrevenue $ %Operating expenses: Research and development$98,587 27.3% $55,155 28.5% $43,432 78.7%Sales and marketing55,115 15.3 28,603 14.8 26,512 92.7General and administrative18,688 5.2 8,501 4.4 10,187 119.8Total operating expenses$172,390 47.8% $92,259 47.7% $80,131 86.9%Research and development. Research and development expenses increased $43.4 million, or 78.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $21.8 million, which was a result of an increase of 153 employees (a 50.0% increase) in research and development headcount. The increase was also due to a $10.1 million increase in prototype expenses as a result of new product introductions and an increase in facilities expenses of $4.5 million.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $26.5 million, or 92.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $19.8 million, which was a result of an increase of 57 employees (a 41.3% increase) in sales and marketing headcount. The increase was also due to an increase of $3.0 million in marketing, consulting and promotional expense related to trade shows, product demonstrations and other marketing activities and an increase in sales and marketing-related IT and system engineering expenses of $2.6 million.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $10.2 million, or 119.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012. The increase was primarily due to a $5.5 million increase in professional service fees related to outside legal, accounting, consulting and IT services to support increased business activity and preparations for becoming a public company. The increase was also due to a $3.4 million increase in personnel costs, which was a result of an increase of 23 employees (a 67.6% increase) in general and administrative headcount.Other Income (Expense), Net (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Change in 2013 2012 $ %Other income (expense), net: Interest expense$(7,119) $(7,057) $(62) 0.9%Other income (expense), net(754) 135 (889) NMTotal other income (expense), net$(7,873) $(6,922) $(951) 13.7% 51Interest expense.

Provision for income taxes increased $4.2 million, or 36.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2013 compared to 2012. Our effective tax rate decreased 8.2 percentage points from 35.3% for the year ended December 31, 2012 to 27.1% for 2013. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the beneficial impact of the passage of the American Tax Relief Act of 2012 signed into law on January 2, 2013, which reinstated the federal research and development credit. The prior year impact of the 2012 federal research and development tax credit benefit was recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2013.Quarterly Results of OperationsThe following tables set forth selected unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for each of the quarters in the years ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, as well as the percentage that each line item represents of total revenue. The information for each of these quarters has been prepared on the same basis as the audited annual financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, in the opinion of management, includes all adjustments, which includes only normal recurring adjustments, necessary for the fair presentation of the results of operations for these periods in accordance with GAAP. This data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

As of December 31, 2014, cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities were $449.5 million of which approximately $56.6 million was held outside the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries. We have not repatriated nor do we currently have plans to repatriate these funds, but if we were to repatriate cash held outside of the U.S. for domestic cash operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes to repatriate these funds less any previously paid foreign income taxes. We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2014 to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.On June 6, 2014, we completed our IPO in which we sold 6,037,500 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $43.00 per share, which included 787,500 shares of common stock issued pursuant to the exercise in full of the over-allotment option by the underwriters. The IPO resulted in proceeds of $239.1 million, net of underwriting discounts and commissions of $15.6 million and other issuance costs of $5.0 million. In connection with the closing of the IPO, all of our outstanding convertible preferred stock automatically converted into 24,000,000 shares of common stock on a one-to-one basis.Upon the closing of our IPO, all noteholders with the exception of one noteholder converted the principal and accrued interest amount outstanding under their subordinated convertible promissory notes into shares of our common stock at the IPO price of $43.00 per share. The noteholder, who did not elect to so convert, was paid a total of $23.6 million which included principal and accrued interest less applicable withholding taxes of $1.1 million. The remainder of the noteholders converted the remaining debt balance of approximately $96.5 million including principal and accrued interest into 2.2 million shares of our common stock. Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. One of the principal purposes of our IPO was to obtain additional capital to fund the growth of our business. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, our costs and access to outsourcing our manufacturing, our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies as well as the continued market acceptance of our products. If we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us. If we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results, and financial condition may be adversely affected.53 Cash Flows December 31, 2014 2013 (in thousands)Cash and cash equivalents$240,031 $113,664 Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012 (in thousands)Cash provided by operating activities $114,516 $34,648 $26,306Cash used in investing activities (249,362) (19,491) (12,352)Cash provided by financing activities 261,337 9,886 3,977Effect of exchange rate changes (124) (34) (1)Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $126,367 $25,009 $17,930Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesOur primary source of cash from operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increases in sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs and investment in sales and marketing and research and development. We expect cash outflows from operating activities to increase as a result of further investment in sales and marketing and increases in personnel costs as we grow our business. During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $114.5 million primarily from net income of $86.9 million, net non-cash charges of $11.8 million, and an increase of $15.8 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due an increase in deferred revenue of $47.6 million resulting from the increase in sales, an increase in accrued liabilities of $18.9 million largely related to our payroll and corporate bonus plan and an increase in accounts payable of $14.0 million due to the timing of our payments, partially offset by a reduction in cash from an increase in accounts receivable of $19.8 million from higher products shipments, an increase in inventories of $13.4 million to meet our customer demand and an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $32.6 million primarily due to higher prepaid taxes, and supplier rebates resulting from our increased inventory purchases.During the year ended December 31, 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $34.6 million, primarily from net income of $42.5 million and non-cash charges of $6.8 million, partially offset by a decrease of $14.6 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $49.2 million increase in inventory for anticipated growth in our business, a $28.3 million increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales partially offset by an increase in cash from a $3.0 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by an increase in cash from a $3.9 million increase in accounts payable primarily attributable to the timing of payments, a $12.0 million increase in accrued liabilities attributable to higher warranty liabilities and higher accrued personnel costs due to growth in headcount, a $34.1 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased sales and a $6.0 million increase in interest payable attributable to our outstanding convertible promissory notes, including our related party convertible promissory notes.During the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by operating activities was $26.3 million, consisting of net income of $21.3 million adjusted by non-cash charges of $4.0 million and a $0.9 million increase due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $22.0 million increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales, a $7.2 million increase in inventory and a $5.0 million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by a $13.5 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased sales, a $6.5 million increase in accrued liabilities attributable to higher warranty liabilities and higher accrued personnel costs due to growth in headcount and a $6.0 million increase in interest payable attributable to our outstanding convertible promissory notes, including our related party convertible promissory notes.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of property and equipment. We expect to continue to make purchases of property and equipment to support continued growth of our business. During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash used in investing activities was $249.4 million, consisting primarily of purchases of marketable securities of $210.0 million, purchases of property and equipment of $13.1 million and other investing activities of $38.2 million largely due to a $33.6 million equity investments in privately held companies, partially offset by the proceeds of the repayments of our notes receivable of $8.0 million and the release of our restricted cash into cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 million. 54During the year ended December 31, 2013, cash used in investing activities was $19.5 million, of which $20.3 million relates to the purchase of property and equipment offset by notes receivable repayments of $1.0 million.During the year ended December 31, 2012, cash used in investing activities was $12.4 million, of which $3.3 million relates to purchases of property and equipment, $5.0 million relates to an investment in a private company and $4.0 million relates to an increase in restricted cash representing a security deposit required for a facility lease.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesOur cash flows provided by financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds from the IPO and exercises of stock options partially offset by repayment of our subordinated convertible promissory notes. During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by financing activities was $261.3 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds raised from our IPO of $239.3 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of repurchases of $25.4 million and excess tax benefits from our incentive plans amounting to $17.4 million. These proceeds were partially offset by the repayment of our notes payable of $20.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2013, cash provided by financing activities was $9.9 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of repurchases, amounting to $9.0 million and excess tax benefits realized from our equity incentive plans amounting to $0.9 million.During the year ended December 31, 2012, cash provided by financing activities was $4.0 million, consisting primarily of $3.9 million in proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, net of repurchases.Debt ObligationsIn January 2011, we sold $55.0 million aggregate principal amount of subordinated convertible promissory notes, or Convertible Notes, to outside investors and $25.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes to two trusts that are related to two of our co-founders. In June 2011, we sold an additional $20.0 million aggregate principal amount of Convertible Notes to outside investors. The interest rate on the Convertible Notes was 6.0% per annum, computed on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed and a year of 365 days. Upon the closing of our IPO, all noteholders with the exception of one noteholder converted the principal and accrued interest amount outstanding under their subordinated convertible promissory notes into shares of our common stock at the IPO price of $43.00 per share. The noteholder, who did not elect to so convert, was paid a total of $23.6 million which included principal and accrued interest less applicable withholding taxes of $1.1 million. The remainder of the noteholders converted the remaining debt balance of approximately $96.5 million including principal and accrued interest into 2.2 million shares of our common stock. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2014, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. Our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations with terms in excess of one year. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash balances.The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2014 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than5 YearsFinancing lease obligation1 $54,968 $5,588 $17,800 $12,769 $18,811Operating lease obligations 45,189 2,583 14,830 10,901 16,875Total $100,157 $8,171 $32,630 $23,670 $35,686_________________1Includes interest and land lease The contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of $18.6 million related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments.55Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are described below.Revenue RecognitionWe generate revenue from the sale of network switches which incorporate our EOS software and accessories such as cables and optics to direct customers and channel partners together with PCS. We typically sell products and PCS in a single transaction. We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery or performance has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured.We define each of the four criteria above as follows:•Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Evidence of an arrangement consists of stand-alone purchase orders or purchase orders issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a master sales agreement. It is our practice to identify an end customer prior to shipment to a reseller or distributor.•Delivery or performance has occurred. We use shipping documents or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. We recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which primarily is upon shipment to customers. We generally do not have significant obligations for future performance, rights of return, pricing credits or customer acceptance provisions associated with our product sales. In instances where substantive acceptance provisions are specified in the customer arrangement, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met.•The sales price is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment.•Collectability is reasonably assured. We assess probability of collectability on a customer-by-customer basis. Our customers and channel partners are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates their financial condition and ability to pay for products and services. PCS is offered under renewable, fee-based contracts, which include technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty, bug fixes, patches and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. We initially defer PCS revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the PCS contract, with the related expenses recognized as incurred. PCS contracts usually have a term of one to three years. We include billed but unearned PCS revenue in deferred revenue.We report revenue net of sales taxes. We include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold.Multiple-Element ArrangementsMost of our arrangements, other than renewals of PCS, are multiple-element arrangements with a combination of products and PCS. Products and PCS generally qualify as separate units of accounting. Our hardware deliverables and included EOS software together deliver the essential functionality of our products. For multiple-element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. The relative selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: vendor-specific objective evidence, or VSOE, if available; third-party evidence, or TPE, if VSOE is not available; and best estimate of selling price, or BESP, if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. As we have not been able to establish VSOE or TPE for our products and most of our services, we generally utilize BESP for the purposes of allocating revenue to each unit of accounting.•VSOE—We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific products and services when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the stand-alone selling prices fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. • TPE—When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple-element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for interchangeable products or services when sold separately to similarly situated customers. However, as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and offer substantially different features and functionality, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. Additionally, as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products’ selling prices are on a stand-alone basis, we are not able to obtain reliable evidence of TPE of selling price. 56•BESP—When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. BESP is based on considering multiple factors including, but not limited to the sales channel (reseller, distributor or end customer), the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international) and size of the end customer. We limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations, or subject to customer-specific return, acceptance or refund privileges. We account for multiple agreements with a single partner as one arrangement if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single arrangement. We may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is no contractual provision for such returns. We estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against current-period gross revenues. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate. InventoriesInventories primarily consist of finished goods purchased from third party contract manufacturers and are stated at the lower of cost (computed using the first-in, first-out method) or market value. Manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory. In addition, we also purchase certain strategic component inventory, including integrated circuits which are consigned to our contract manufacturers. We record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand or obsolete to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value.We use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures. These estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers, product development plans and current sales levels. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and provisions for non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability.WarrantyWe offer a one-year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90-day warranty against defects in any software embedded in the products. We use judgment and estimates when determining warranty costs based on historical costs primarily to replace or repair product returns within the warranty period at the time we recognize revenue. We accrue specifically identified reserves if and when we determine we have a systemic product failure. Historically, we have identified specific products that failed in the field prematurely at higher than expected rates due to various component issues. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs, if actual product failure rates or use of materials differ from estimates, additional warranty costs may be incurred, which could reduce our gross margin.Stock-Based CompensationCompensation expense related to stock-based transactions, including stock options, restricted stock awards, or RSAs, and stock purchase rights, is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of each stock-based award is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. The stock-based compensation expense, net of forfeitures, is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally four years.Our use of the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including the fair value of the underlying common stock, the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future.These assumptions and estimates are as follows:•Fair Value of Common Stock. Prior to our IPO, we estimated the fair value of common stock, based on numerous subjective and objective factors at each grant date.•Expected Term. The expected term represents the period that our option awards are expected to be outstanding. We consider several factors in estimating the expected term of options granted, including the expected lives used by a peer group of companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business, and the historical option exercise behavior of our employees, which we believe is representative of future behavior.•Expected Volatility. The volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatilities of a peer group of public companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based grants. We did not rely on implied volatilities of traded options in our industry peers’ common stock because the volume of activity was low. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies 57until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.•Risk-Free Interest Rate. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal to the option’s expected term.•Dividend Yield. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.In addition to the assumptions used in the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover and other factors. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may have refinements to our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.Income TaxesIncome tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes.We account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements but have not been reflected in our taxable income. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. We measure deferred income tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize.We believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.Loss ContingenciesWe use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability in determining loss contingencies. We accrue an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the amount of loss. We record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRefer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.58Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and investments in privately held companies. Foreign Currency RiskOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe and Asia. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The effect of a 100 basis point hypothetical change in foreign currency exchanges rates applicable to our business would not have a material impact on our historical consolidated financial statements.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale marketable securities, notes receivable and our indebtedness. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in cash deposits, money market funds with maturities of less than 90 days from the date of purchase. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the U.S. However, because of the short-term nature of the instruments in our portfolio, a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $209.4 million invested in available-for-sale marketable securities. An immediate hypothetical change of 100 basis points to the interest rate would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows. As of December 31, 2013, we did not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.Investments in Privately Held CompaniesWe have invested in privately held companies in 2014. These investments are recorded in investments, non-current in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using the cost method. As of December 31, 2014, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was $33.6 million. Some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.59Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:22:13.836571

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewWe are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of large-scale Internet companies, cloud service providers and next-generation data centers for enterprise support. Our cloud networking solutions consist of our Extensible Operating System, or EOS, a set of network applications and our Ethernet switches. Our cloud networking solutions deliver industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility. At the core of our cloud networking platform is EOS, which was purpose-built to be fully programmable and highly modular. The programmability of EOS has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking, including workflow automation, network visibility and analytics, and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services.We were founded in 2004 to address the limitations of legacy networking products and to create a cloud networking platform that is open and programmable. From 2004 to 2008, our activities were focused on the development of our software, which resulted in the commercial release of our first product, the 7100 Series switches based on our EOS software, in 2008. Since then, we have continued to introduce new products utilizing EOS, including our 7500 Series switch and our 7050 Series switch in 2010, the second generation of our 7500 Series switch, called the 7500E modular switch, in May 2013, our 7300 Series switch in November 2013, our 7280E in July 2014. In December 2014, we introduced our EOS+ software platform for networking programmability and automation, and in June 2015 we introduced CloudVision, a network-wide approach for workload orchestration and workflow automation. In September 2015, we introduced our Macro Segmentation Services (“MSS”) to provide automated insertion of security and other in-line layer 4-7 services within any software driven cloud networking infrastructure. MSS has been endorsed by many of our technology alliance ecosystem partners with whom we are currently partnering with to deliver MSS platform support. We also introduced our first 10/25/40/50/100G switches with our 7060, 7260 and 7320 series switches. As of December 31, 2015, we have shipped more than five million switch ports. We have experienced rapid revenue growth over the last several years, increasing our revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 56.4% from 2011 to 2015. As we have grown the functionality of our EOS software, expanded the range of our switching portfolio and increased the size of our sales force, our revenue has continued to grow rapidly. To support our customers and revenue growth, we have expanded our international presence to include 20 foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 including for example Australia, Canada, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $837.6 million an increase of 43.4%, compared to the same period in 2014. We have been profitable and cash flow positive for each year since 2010.We believe that our cloud networking platform addresses the large and growing cloud networking segment of data center switching, which remains in the early stage of adoption. We expect to continue rapidly growing our organization to meet the needs of new and existing customers as they increasingly realize the performance and cost benefits of our cloud networking solutions and as they expand their cloud networks. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications. We intend to continue expanding our sales and marketing teams and programs and carrying out associated marketing activities in key geographies. In order to support our strong growth, we have and may continue to accelerate our investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations. As a result, our levels of operating profit as a percentage of revenue could decline in the short to medium term. For a description of factors that may impact our future performance, see the disclosure in the section titled ""Factors Affecting Our Performance"" below.45Our Business ModelWe derive revenue from sales of products and services. We generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our EOS software. We generate the majority of our services revenue from post contract support, or PCS, which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products. Since shipping our first products in 2008, our cumulative end-customer base has grown rapidly. Between December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2015, our cumulative end-customer base grew from approximately 1,100 to over 3,700. Our end customers span a range of industries and include large Internet companies, service providers, financial services organizations, government agencies, media and entertainment companies and others.To continue to grow our revenue, it is important that we both obtain new customers and sell additional products to existing customers. Our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our EOS software and enhancements to EOS. We engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture. Today, we combine our EOS software with merchant silicon into a family of switching products. This enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions. We currently procure certain merchant silicon components from multiple vendors, and we continue to expand our relationships with these and other vendors. We work closely with third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. Our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third party direct fulfillment facilities where our EOS software is installed on our products. We and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers.We market and sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners, including distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, original equipment manufacturer, or “OEM”, partners and in conjunction with various technology partners. To facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity, we have created a partner program, the Arista Partner Program, to engage partners who provide value-added services and extend our reach into the marketplace. Authorized training partners provide technical training to our channel partners. Our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us, and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders. Our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us. Our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for pre-sales technical support and engineering for our end customers. Each sales team is responsible for a geographic territory, has responsibility for a number of major direct end-customer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, 77.3%, 79.7%, and 82.9% of our revenue was generated from the Americas, substantially all from the U.S., 15.3%, 12.8%, and 11.2% from Europe, the Middle East and Africa and 7.4%, 7.5%, and 5.9% from the Asia-Pacific region, respectively.Factors Affecting Our PerformanceWe believe that our future success will depend on many factors, including our ability to expand sales to our existing customers as well as to add new end customers. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results. See the section titled “Risk Factors.” Additionally, we face intense competition especially from larger, well-established companies, and we must continue to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform to succeed in our market. We are also currently engaged in lawsuits with Cisco, our largest competitor whereby they claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We intend to vigorously defend against these Cisco lawsuits as summarized in the Legal Proceedings section below. However, we cannot be certain that any claims by Cisco would be resolved in our favor. If we are unable to address these challenges, our business could be adversely affected.Increasing Adoption of Cloud Networks. Networks are subject to increasing performance requirements due to growing numbers of connected devices as well as new enterprise and consumer applications. Computing architectures are evolving to meet the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications. We believe that cloud networks will continue to replace legacy network technologies. Our business and results of operations will be significantly affected by the speed with which organizations implement cloud networks.Expanding Sales to Existing Customer Base. We expect that a substantial portion of our future sales will be follow-on sales to existing end customers. As noted above, one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our cloud networking solutions, thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers. We believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing and expected infrastructure spend. We expect our business and results of operations will depend on our ability to sell additional products to our growing base of customers.Adding New End Customers. We believe that the cloud networking market is still in the early stages of adoption. We intend to target new end customers by continuing to invest in our field sales force and extending our relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners. To date, we have primarily targeted end customers with the largest cloud data centers. A typical initial order involves the education of prospective customers about the technical merits and capabilities and potential cost savings of our products as compared to our competitors’ products. Our results of operations will depend on our ability to continue to add new customers. We believe that 46customer references have been, and will continue to be, an important factor in winning new business with special emphasis on four key verticals: the cloud titans, financial services, service and internet hosting providers and high tech enterprises.Selling More Complex and Higher-Performance Configurations. Our results of operations have been, and we believe will continue to be, affected by our ability to sell more complex and higher-performance configurations of our products. Our ability to sustain our revenue growth will depend, in part, upon our continued sales of these more robust configurations, and quarterly results of operations can be significantly impacted by the mix of products and product configurations sold during the period.Leveraging Channel Partners. We expect to continue to derive a growing portion of our sales through our channel partners as they develop new end customers and expand sales to our existing end customers. We plan to continue to invest in our network of channel partners to enable them to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support effectively. We believe that increasing channel leverage will extend and improve our engagement with a broad set of customers. Investing in Research and Development for Growth. We believe that the market for cloud networking is still in the early stages of adoption and we intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products including new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and new applications building upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts. By investing in research and development, we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity. We expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these product development investments.Customer Concentration and Timing of Large Orders. Historically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for significant portion of our revenue. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013, our largest end customer accounted for 12.0%, 14.9%, and 21.9% of our revenue, respectively. We have also experienced and continue to experience customer concentration on a quarterly basis. In addition, we have experienced increases in the size of our orders, including orders from existing customers, which could result in future increased customer concentration, depending on the timing of the fulfillment of those orders. We have also experienced unpredictability in the timing of large orders, especially with respect to our large end customers, due to the complexity of orders, the time it takes end customers to evaluate, test, qualify and accept our products and factors specific to our end customers. Due to these factors, we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, we have provided, and may in the future provide, pricing discounts to large end customers, which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur. Our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers.47Basis of PresentationRevenue We generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our EOS software. We also derive a portion of our revenue from sales of post contract support, or PCS, and to a lesser extent professional services. We generate PCS revenue from sales of technical support services contracts that are typically purchased in conjunction with our products and subsequent renewals of those contracts. We offer PCS services under renewable, fee-based contracts, which include 24-hour technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts, bug fixes, patches and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if available basis. We expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing and size of orders, the delivery and acceptance of products, the impact of significant transactions with unique terms and conditions that may require deferral of revenue and cyclicality of orders being placed by our customers. Additionally, we expect PCS revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our installed base. Our ability to expand our installed base and increase our revenue is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. See the section titled “Risk Factors.” We report revenue net of sales taxes.Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our third-party contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors, overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department, and other manufacturing-related costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases. Cost of providing PCS and other services consists primarily of personnel costs for our global customer support organization. We expect our cost of service revenue to increase as our PCS revenue increases.Gross MarginGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing, the average sales price of our offerings, manufacturing costs, merchant silicon costs and the mix of products sold. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time, depending on the factors described above and others. See the section titled “Risk Factors.”Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation and travel expenses. We expect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business.Research and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, with the remainder being prototype expenses, third-party engineering and contractor support costs, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs and depreciation. Our research and development efforts are focused on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development, including new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and applications. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership.Sales and Marketing ExpensesSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and also include costs related to marketing and promotional activities, with the remainder being an allocated portion of facility and IT costs and depreciation. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide and expand our relationships with current and future channel partners and end customers.48General and Administrative ExpensesGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, legal and professional fees, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs and depreciation. General and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive, finance, IT, human resources and legal functions. Our professional fees consist primarily of accounting, external legal and IT and other consulting costs. Refer to the discussion under “Legal Proceedings” subheading in Note 5. Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for information related to pending litigation.Other Income (Expense), NetInterest Expense Interest expense consists of interest expense on our subordinated convertible promissory notes, including our related party subordinated convertible promissory notes which were converted during fiscal 2014 and interest expense from our lease financing obligation.Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) consists of gains on investments, write-offs of debt discount on notes payable which were repaid and converted during fiscal 2014, and foreign currency exchange gains and losses. Our foreign currency exchange gains and losses relate to transactions and asset and liability balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Provision for Income TaxesWe operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to U.S. income tax. Generally, our U.S. tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these earnings which avoids double taxation. Our tax expense to date consists of federal, state and foreign current and deferred income taxes. As we expand internationally, our marginal tax rate may decrease; however, there can be no certainty that our marginal tax rate will decrease, and we may experience changes in tax rates that are not reflective of actual changes in our business or operations.We account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements but have not been reflected in our taxable income. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. We measure deferred income tax assets and liabilities using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize.We believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.49Results of OperationsThe following table summarizes historical results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of revenue for those periods. We have derived the data for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 from our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in thus Form 10-K (in thousands, except for percentage of revenue).

Product revenue increased 40.1% in the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to 2014. We increased shipments to our existing customers during the year as they continued to grow their businesses and increase their demand for our switch products and related accessories. In addition, we continued to add new customers as we expanded our market presence and geographic footprint. Service revenue increased 76.4% in the year ended December 31, 2015 with growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand. We also continued to experience fluctuations in product and service pricing due to competitive market pressures. However, these were more than offset by the increased demand drivers outlined above.Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin. Gross margin decreased from 67.1% to 64.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. This decrease in 2015 was primarily due to increased inventory-related obsolescence charges associated with upcoming product transitions and higher warranty costs, in addition to a greater mix of revenue from larger customers who typically receive higher discounts.

Research and development expenses increased $60.5 million, or 40.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $33.3 million, resulting from increases in headcount, stock based compensation as well as additional bonus expense under our corporate bonus plan. Prototype spend and third-party engineering and consulting costs increased by $14.2 million, and facilities and IT infrastructure costs increased $8.6 million due to new product introductions and the continued expansion and support of our research and development activities.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $23.7 million, or 27.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $17.0 million, resulting from increased headcount and additional sales commissions. The increase also related to additional product field demonstration costs of $6.0 million.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $43.4 million, or 134.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was due to an increase in legal fees of $39.8 million primarily related to the Cisco and OptumSoft legal matters outlined in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, personnel costs increased by $4.1 million reflecting additional bonus cost under our corporate bonus program and increased stock-based compensation charges during 2015.52Other Income (Expense), Net (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Change in 2015 2014 $ %Other income (expense), net: Interest expense$(3,152) $(6,280) $3,128 (49.8)%Other income (expense), net(147) 2,275 (2,422) (106.5)Total other income (expense), net$(3,299) $(4,005) $706 (17.6)%Interest expense. The reduction in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 is primarily related to repayment and conversion of our notes payable upon closing of our initial public offering during the second quarter of 2014. Other income (expense), net. The unfavorable change in other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to a one-time gain on our notes receivable of $4.0 million in 2014, partially offset by a $0.7 million write-off related to the debt discount on notes payable during the second quarter of 2014, and a reduction in transactional exchange rate losses during 2015.Provision for Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Change in 2015 2014 $ %Provision for income taxes$24,907 $34,658 $(9,751) (28.1)%Effective tax rate17.1% 28.5% Provision for income taxes was approximately $24.9 million and $34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The change in our provision was the result of an increase in profit before income taxes, offset by a decrease due to foreign mix earnings taxed at a lower rate than the US tax rate, release of reserves due to expiration of the statute of limitations in certain domestic jurisdictions, and reinstatement of the federal research and development (""R&D"") credit.The R&D credit, which was made permanent under Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act, signed into law on December 18, 2015. The impact of the 2015 federal R&D tax credit benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2015.Year Ended December 31, 2014 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2013Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change in $ % ofrevenue $ % ofrevenue $ %Revenue$584,106 100.0% $361,224 100.0% $222,882 61.7%Cost of revenue192,015 32.9 122,686 34.0 69,329 56.5Gross profit$392,091 67.1% $238,538 66.0% $153,553 64.4%Gross margin67.1% 66.0% Revenue. Revenue increased $222.9 million, or 61.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase in revenue was predominately driven by increased product shipments to existing customers due to increased demand for our switch products and related accessories. In addition, our cumulative number of customers grew approximately 33% from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014 as we continued to broaden our market penetration.Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin. Gross margin increased from 66.0% for the year ended December 31, 2013 to 67.1% for 2014. The increase in gross margin was primarily the result of specific warranty and excess and obsolete inventory-related charges of $10.3 million recorded in 2013 that did not recur in 2014. To a lesser extent, gross margin in 2014 was negatively impacted by a decrease in product margins due to a higher revenue mix from larger customers who typically receive higher volume discounts.53Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2014 2013 Change in $ % ofrevenue $ % ofrevenue $ %Operating expenses: Research and development$148,909 25.5% $98,587 27.3% $50,322 51.0%Sales and marketing85,338 14.6 55,115 15.3 30,223 54.8General and administrative32,331 5.5 18,688 5.2 13,643 73.0Total operating expenses$266,578 45.6% $172,390 47.8% $94,188 54.6%Research and development. Research and development expenses increased $50.3 million, or 51.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $39.0 million, resulting from an increase of 156 employees (a 34.1% increase) from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014, and additional bonus expenses under our corporate bonus plan. The increase was also due to an increase of $6.6 million in research and development related facilities and IT infrastructure costs, and increases in third-party engineering costs of $5.9 million and depreciation expense of $2.0 million, as we continued to expand and support our research and development activities. These expenses were partially offset by a $4.3 million reduction in prototype spending related to project timing.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $30.2 million, or 54.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $23.4 million, resulting from an increase of 45 employees (a 23.0% increase) from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014, as well as an increase in sales commissions resulting from higher sales volume. The increase was also due to an increase of $3.7 million in product demonstrations, expenses incurred to expand our sales engineering labs to support our growing customer base, consulting expenses.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses increased $13.6 million, or 73.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $5.7 million, resulting from an increase of 17 employees (a 29.8% increase) from December 31, 2013 to December 31, 2014, and additional expenses under our corporate bonus plan. We also incurred higher professional service fees of $3.7 million related to outside legal, accounting and consulting services to support increased business activity, litigation and public-company activities. The increase was also attributable to higher insurance expense and franchise taxes of $1.5 million associated with being a public company, and a $1.0 million charitable donation through a fund established by the Company in 2014.Other Income (Expense), Net (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Change in 2014 2013 $ %Other income (expense), net: Interest expense$(6,280) $(7,119) $839 (11.8)%Other income (expense), net2,275 (754) 3,029 NMTotal other income (expense), net$(4,005) $(7,873) $3,868 (49.1)%Interest expense.

Other income (expense), net increased for the year ended December 31, 2014, compared to 2013 due to the gain on our notes receivable of $4.0 million offset by a $0.7 million write-off related to the debt discount on notes payable upon our IPO, further offset by net transactional exchange rate losses.Provision for Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Change in 2014 2013 $ %Provision for income taxes$34,658 $15,815 $18,843 119.1%Effective tax rate28.5% 27.1% Provision for income taxes was approximately $34.7 million and $15.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Provision for income taxes increased $18.8 million, or 119.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2014 compared to 2013. The change in our provision for income taxes was primarily due to an increase in profit before income tax. The change in the effective tax rate was a result of the geographical distribution of the earnings, the federal R&D tax credit for 2014 including only a current year benefit, as compared to a two-year federal R&D tax credit benefit for 2013, and an increase in state taxes.54The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2014 included the impact of the reinstatement of the 2014 R&D credit. The impact of the 2014 Federal R&D tax credit benefit was recorded in the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2014. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2013 included the impact of the reinstatement of the 2013 and 2012 Federal R&D tax credits. Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2015, cash and cash equivalents were $687.3 million, of which approximately $41.6 million was held outside the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries. We have not repatriated nor do we currently have plans to repatriate these funds, but if we were to repatriate cash held outside of the U.S. for domestic cash operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes to repatriate these funds less any previously paid foreign income taxes. We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2015 to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, our costs and access to outsourcing our manufacturing, our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies, the continued market acceptance of our products, and costs incurred related to outstanding litigation claims. If we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.

We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increased sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs, inventory purchases from our contract manufacturer, investment in research and development, and litigation expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $200.5 million, primarily from net income of $121.1 million, net non-cash charges of ($1.2) million, and a net increase in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $80.6 million. The net increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of $90.3 million, largely related to short and long-term services contracts and product revenue deferrals related to contracts with acceptance terms. In addition, we experienced an increase in cash of $32.0 million from income taxes payable and an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $29.4 million due to the timing of payments. These operating liability increases were offset by an increase in our accounts receivable of $47.3 million resulting from an increase in sales during the period. In addition, inventory increased $14.1 million during the period due to higher shipment volume, and prepaid expenses and current assets increased $7.8 million in the period.During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $131.9 million primarily from net income of $86.9 million, net non-cash charges of $11.0 million, and an increase of $33.2 million due to changes in our operating assets and 55liabilities. The increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due an increase in deferred revenue of $47.6 million resulting from the increase in sales, an increase in accrued liabilities of $18.9 million largely related to our payroll and corporate bonus plan and an increase in accounts payable of $14.0 million due to the timing of our payments, partially offset by a reduction in cash from an increase in accounts receivable of $19.0 million from higher products shipments, an increase in inventories of $13.4 million to meet our customer demand, an increase of $15.3 million in cash paid for income taxes, and supplier rebates receivable resulting from our increased inventory purchases.During the year ended December 31, 2013, cash provided by operating activities was $34.6 million, primarily from net income of $42.5 million and non-cash charges of $6.6 million, partially offset by a decrease of $14.6 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The decrease in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a $49.2 million increase in inventory for anticipated growth in our business, a $28.1 million increase in accounts receivable due to an increase in sales partially offset by an increase in cash from a $3.0 million decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets, partially offset by an increase in cash from a $3.9 million increase in accounts payable primarily attributable to the timing of payments, a $12.0 million increase in accrued liabilities attributable to higher warranty liabilities and higher accrued personnel costs due to growth in headcount, a $34.1 million increase in deferred revenue due to increased sales and a $6.0 million increase in interest payable attributable to our outstanding convertible promissory notes, including our related party convertible promissory notes.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities have consisted primarily of capital expenditures and net investment purchases of available for sale marketable securities. We expect to continue investing in these activities to support the continued growth of our business.During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by investing activities was $184.2 million, consisting of proceeds from the maturity of available-for-sale securities of $208.2 million, offset by purchases of property, equipment and other assets of $19.2 million and increase in restricted cash of $4.0 million related to a security deposit required for a facility lease.During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash used in investing activities was $249.4 million, consisting primarily of purchases of marketable securities of $210.0 million, purchases of property and equipment of $13.1 million and other investing activities of $38.2 million largely due to a $33.6 million equity investments in privately held companies, partially offset by the proceeds of the repayments of our notes receivable of $8.0 million and the release of our restricted cash into cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2013, cash used in investing activities was $19.5 million, of which $20.3 million relates to the purchase of property and equipment offset by notes receivable repayments of $1.0 million.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesDuring the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $63.1 million, consisting primarily of the excess tax benefit associated with equity incentive plans of $37.3 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of repurchases of $17.8 million and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our ESPP of $9.4 million.During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by financing activities was $244.0 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds raised from our initial public offering of $239.3 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of repurchases of $8.0 million and excess tax benefits from our equity incentive plans amounting to $17.4 million. These proceeds were partially offset by the repayment of our notes payable of $20.0 million. During the year ended December 31, 2013, cash provided by financing activities was $9.9 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of repurchases, amounting to $9.0 million and excess tax benefits associated with our equity incentive plans amounting to $0.9 million.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2015, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. Our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations with terms in excess of one year. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash balances. 56The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2015 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than5 YearsFinancing lease obligation(1) $49,380 $5,754 $12,047 $12,769 $18,810Operating lease obligations 52,083 6,307 12,937 11,389 21,450Non-cancelable purchase obligations 43,902 43,902 — — Total $145,365 $55,963 $24,984 $24,158 $40,260_________________(1) Includes interest and land lease The contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of $14.3 million related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are the following:Revenue RecognitionWe generate revenue from sales of switching products which incorporate our EOS software and accessories such as cables and optics to direct customers and channel partners together with post contract customer support (“PCS”). We typically sell products and PCS in a single transaction. We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery or performance has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. We define each of the four criteria above as follows: •Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Evidence of an arrangement consists of stand-alone purchase orders or purchase orders issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a master sales agreement. It is our practice to identify an end customer prior to shipment to a reseller or distributor. • Delivery or performance has occurred. We use shipping documents or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. We recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which primarily is upon shipment to customers. We generally do not have significant obligations for future performance, rights of return, or pricing credits associated with our product sales. In instances where substantive acceptance provisions are specified in the customer arrangement, revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met.•The sales price is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. •Collectability is reasonably assured. We assess probability of collectability on a customer-by-customer basis. Our customers and channel partners are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates their financial condition and ability to pay for products and services. PCS is offered under renewable, fee-based contracts, which includes technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty, bug fixes, patches and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. We initially defer PCS revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the PCS contract, with the related expenses recognized as incurred. PCS contracts usually have a term of one to three years. We include billed but unearned PCS revenue in deferred revenue. We report revenue net of sales taxes. We include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold. Multiple-Element Arrangements Most of our arrangements, other than renewals of PCS, are multiple element arrangements with a combination of products and PCS. Products and PCS generally qualify as separate units of accounting. Our hardware deliverables include EOS software, which together deliver the essential functionality of our products. For multiple element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. The relative selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: vendor-specific 57objective evidence (“VSOE”), if available; third-party evidence (“TPE”), if VSOE is not available; and best estimate of selling price (“BESP”), if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. As we have not been able to establish VSOE or TPE for our products and most of our services, we generally utilize BESP for the purposes of allocating revenue to each unit of accounting. •VSOE—We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific products and services when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the stand-alone selling prices fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. • TPE—When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple-element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for interchangeable products or services when sold separately to similarly situated customers. However, as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and offer substantially different features and functionality, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. Additionally, as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products’ selling prices are on a stand-alone basis, we are not able to obtain reliable evidence of TPE of selling price. •BESP—When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. BESP is based on considering multiple factors including, but not limited to the sales channel (reseller, distributor or end customer), the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international) and size of the end customer. We limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations, or subject to customer-specific return, acceptance or refund privileges. We account for multiple agreements with a single partner as 1 arrangement if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single arrangement. We may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is no contractual provision for such returns. We estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against current-period gross revenues. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate. Inventory Valuation and Contract Manufacturer/Supplier LiabilitiesInventories primarily consist of finished goods purchased from third party contract manufacturers and are stated at the lower of cost (computed using the first-in, first-out method) or market value. Manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory. In addition, we purchase strategic component inventory from certain suppliers under purchase commitments that in some cases are non-cancelable, including integrated circuits, which are held by our contract manufacturers. We record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand, or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. We also record a liability for non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete.Our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts. We generally incur a liability when the contract manufacturer has converted the component inventory to a finished product. Historically, we have reimbursed our contract manufacturer for component inventory that has been rendered excess or obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes, or in cases where inventory levels greatly exceed our forecasts. We use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures. These estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers, product development plans and current sales levels. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities.WarrantyWe offer a one-year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90-day warranty against defects in the software embedded in the products. We use judgment and estimates when determining warranty costs based on historical costs to replace product returns within the warranty period at the time we recognize revenue. We accrue for potential warranty claims at the time of shipment as a component of cost of revenues based on historical experience and other relevant information. We reserve for specifically identified products if and when we determine we have a systemic product failure. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs, if actual product failure rates or use of materials differ from estimates, additional warranty costs may be incurred, which could reduce our gross margin. The accrued warranty liability is recorded in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Stock-Based CompensationCompensation expense related to stock-based transactions, including stock options, restricted stock units (""RSUs""), restricted 58stock awards (“RSAs”), and stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase program is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity granted. Stock-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service periods of the awards, which typically ranges from two to five years. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based compensation expense could be materially different in the future. These assumptions and estimates are as follows:Fair Value of Common Stock The fair value of each stock-based award and option is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. This model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option, the expected volatility of the price of our common stock, risk-free interest rates and the expected dividend yield of our common stock. RSUs are measured based on the fair market values of the underlying stock on the dates of grant. Prior to our initial public offering, we estimated the fair value of common stock, based on numerous subjective and objective factors at each grant date.Expected Term The expected term represents the period that our equity grants are expected to be outstanding. For option grants that are considered to be “simple,” we used the simplified method to determine the expected term which calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. For option grants that are not considered “simple,” the expected term is based on historical option exercise behavior and post-vesting cancellations of options by employees. For ESPP grants, the expected term is based on the length of the offering period, which is typically 24 months.Expected VolatilityThe volatility is derived from the average historical stock volatilities of a peer group of public companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based grants. We intend to continue to consistently apply this process using the same or similar public companies until a sufficient amount of historical information regarding the volatility of our own common stock share price becomes available, or unless circumstances change such that the identified companies are no longer similar to us, in which case, more suitable companies whose share prices are publicly available would be utilized in the calculation.Risk-Free Interest Rate The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for zero-coupon U.S. Treasury notes with maturities approximately equal or equivalent to the option’s remaining expected term.Dividend Yield The expected dividend assumption is based on our current expectations about our anticipated dividend policy. We have never declared or paid any cash dividends and do not presently plan to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Consequently, we used an expected dividend yield of zero.In addition to the assumptions used above, we must also estimate a forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for our awards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the forfeiture rate based on actual forfeiture experience, analysis of employee turnover and other factors. Changes in the estimated forfeiture rate can have a significant impact on our stock-based compensation expense as the cumulative effect of adjusting the rate is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed. We will continue to use judgment in evaluating the assumptions related to our stock-based compensation on a prospective basis. As we continue to accumulate additional data related to our common stock, we may refine our estimates, which could materially impact our future stock-based compensation expense.Income TaxesIncome tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes.We account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements, but have not been reflected in our taxable income. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. 59We believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.We regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized. We recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and to the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense.Loss ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are a party to claims and legal proceedings including matters relating to commercial, employee relations, business practices and intellectual property. In assessing loss contingencies, we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss, impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We will record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRefer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.60Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and investments in privately held companies. Foreign Currency Exchange RiskOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe and Asia. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at December 31, 2015 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in cash deposits, money market funds with maturities of less than 90 days from the date of purchase. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the U.S. However, because of the conservative and short-term nature of the instruments in our portfolio, a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.As of December 31, 2015, we had no investments in available-for-sale marketable securities. The effect of an immediate 10% change in interest rates at December 31, 2015 would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows. Investments in Privately Held CompaniesWe have invested in privately held companies in 2014. These investments are recorded in investments, non-current in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using the cost method. As of December 31, 2015, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was $33.6 million. Some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including, among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.61Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:22:12.902751
1596532,ANET,"Arista Networks, Inc.",2017,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.OverviewWe are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of large-scale Internet companies, cloud service providers and next-generation data centers for enterprise support. Our cloud networking solutions consist of our Extensible Operating System, or EOS, a set of network applications and our Ethernet switching and routing platforms. Our cloud networking solutions deliver industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility. At the core of our cloud networking platform is EOS, which was purpose-built to be fully programmable and highly modular. The programmability of EOS has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking, including workflow automation, network visibility and analytics, and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services.As of December 31, 2016, we have shipped more than 10 million cloud networking ports worldwide. We have experienced rapid revenue growth over the last several years, increasing our revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 51.9% from 2011 to 2016. As we have grown the functionality of our EOS software, expanded the range of our product portfolio and increased the size of our sales force, our revenue has continued to grow rapidly. Our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $1.1 billion an increase of 34.8% compared to 2015. We have been profitable and cash flow positive for each year since 2010.We believe that our cloud networking platform addresses the large and growing cloud networking segment of data center switching, which remains in the early stage of adoption. We expect to continue growing our organization to meet the needs of new and existing customers as they increasingly realize the performance and cost benefits of our cloud networking solutions and as they expand their cloud networks. We intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications. We intend to continue expanding our sales and marketing teams and programs and carrying out associated marketing activities in key geographies. In order to support our strong growth, we have and may continue to accelerate our investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations. For a description of factors that may impact our future performance, see the disclosure in the section titled ""Factors Affecting Our Performance"" below.Our Business ModelWe derive revenue from sales of products and services. We generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our EOS software. We generate the majority of our services revenue from post contract support, or PCS, which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products. Since shipping our first products in 2008, our cumulative end-customer base has grown rapidly. Between December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2016, our cumulative end-customer base grew from approximately 1,100 to over 4,200. Our end customers span a range of industries and include large Internet companies, service providers, financial services organizations, government agencies, media and entertainment companies and others.To continue to grow our revenue, it is important that we both obtain new customers and sell additional products to existing customers. Our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our EOS software and enhancements to EOS. We engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture. Today, we combine our EOS software with merchant silicon into a family of switching and routing products. This enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions. We currently procure certain merchant silicon components from multiple vendors, and we continue to expand our relationships with these and other vendors. We work closely with third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. Our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third party direct fulfillment facilities. We and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers. We have expanded our contract manufacturing capabilities to include Sanmina as an additional contract manufacturer. We market and sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners, including distributors, value-added resellers, system integrators, original equipment manufacturer, or ""OEM"" partners and in conjunction with various technology partners. To facilitate channel coordination and increase productivity, we have created a partner program, the Arista Partner Program, to engage partners who provide value-added services and extend our reach into the marketplace. Authorized training partners provide technical training to our channel partners. Our partners commonly receive an order from an end customer prior to placing an order with us, and we confirm the identification of the end customer prior to accepting such orders. Our partners generally do not stock inventory received from us. Our sales organization is supported by systems engineers with deep technical expertise and responsibility for pre-sales technical 47support and engineering for our end customers. Each sales team is responsible for a geographic territory, has responsibility for a number of major direct end-customer accounts or has assigned accounts in a specific vertical market. Factors Affecting Our PerformanceWe believe that our future success will depend on many factors, including our ability to expand sales to our existing customers as well as to add new end customers. While these areas present significant opportunity, they also present risks that we must manage to ensure successful results. See the section titled “Risk Factors.” Additionally, we face intense competition especially from larger, well-established companies, and we must continue to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform to succeed in our market. We are also currently engaged in several lawsuits with Cisco, our largest competitor, whereby they claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We intend to vigorously defend against these Cisco lawsuits as summarized in the Legal Proceedings section below. However, we cannot be certain that any claims by Cisco would be resolved in our favor. If we are unable to address these challenges, our business could be adversely affected.Increasing Adoption of Cloud Networks. Networks are subject to increasing performance requirements due to the growing number of connected devices as well as new enterprise and consumer applications. Computing architectures are evolving to meet the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications. We believe that cloud networks will continue to replace legacy network technologies. Our business and results of operations will be significantly affected by the speed with which organizations implement cloud networks.Expanding Sales to Existing Customer Base. We expect that a substantial portion of our future sales will be follow-on sales to existing end customers. As noted above, one of our sales strategies is to target specific projects at our current end customers because they are familiar with the operational and economic benefits of our cloud networking solutions, thereby reducing the sales cycle into these customers. We believe this opportunity with current end customers to be significant given their existing and expected infrastructure spend. We expect our business and results of operations will depend on our ability to sell additional products to our growing base of customers.Adding New End Customers. We believe that the cloud networking market is still in the early stages of adoption. We intend to target new end customers by continuing to invest in our field sales force and extending our relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners. To date, we have primarily targeted end customers with the largest cloud data centers. A typical initial order involves the education of prospective customers about the technical merits and capabilities and potential cost savings of our products as compared to our competitors’ products. Our results of operations will depend on our ability to continue to add new customers. We believe that customer references have been, and will continue to be, an important factor in winning new business with special emphasis on four key verticals: the cloud titans, financial services, service and internet hosting providers and high tech enterprises.Selling More Complex and Higher-Performance Configurations. Our results of operations have been, and we believe will continue to be, affected by our ability to sell more complex and higher-performance configurations of our products. Our ability to sustain our revenue growth will depend, in part, upon our continued sales of these more robust configurations, and quarterly results of operations can be significantly impacted by the mix of products and product configurations sold during the period.Leveraging Channel Partners. We expect to continue to derive a growing portion of our sales through our channel partners as they develop new end customers and expand sales to our existing end customers. We plan to continue to invest in our network of channel partners to enable them to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers and provide services and support effectively. We believe that increasing channel leverage will extend and improve our engagement with a broad set of customers. Investing in Research and Development for Growth. We believe that the market for cloud networking is still in the early stages of adoption and we intend to continue investing for long-term growth. We expect to continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products such as our 7280R platform, 7500R series and 7160 series, new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and new applications building upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in the speed of our product development efforts. By investing in research and development, we believe we will be well positioned to continue our rapid growth and take advantage of our large market opportunity. We expect that our results of operations will be impacted by the timing and size of these product development investments.Customer Concentration and Timing of Large Orders. Historically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for significant portion of our revenue. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, our largest end customer accounted for 16.4%, 12.0%, and 14.9% of our revenue, respectively. We have also experienced and continue to experience customer concentration on a quarterly basis. In addition, we have experienced increases in the size of our orders, including orders from existing customers, which could result in future increased customer concentration, depending on the timing of the fulfillment of those orders. We have also experienced unpredictability in the timing of large orders, especially with respect to our large end customers, due to the complexity of orders, the time it takes end customers to evaluate, test, qualify and accept our products and factors specific to our end customers. Due to these factors, we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, we have provided, and may in the future provide, pricing discounts to large end customers, which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur. Our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers.48Components of Operating ResultsRevenue We generate revenue primarily from sales of our products, which incorporate our EOS software. We also derive a portion of our revenue from sales of post contract support, or PCS, and to a lesser extent professional services. We generate PCS revenue from sales of technical support services contracts that are typically purchased in conjunction with our products and subsequent renewals of those contracts. We expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing and size of orders, the delivery and acceptance of products, and the impact of significant transactions with unique terms and conditions that may require deferral of revenue. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our third-party contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors, overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department, and other manufacturing-related costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases. Cost of providing PCS and other services consists primarily of personnel costs for our global customer support organization. Gross MarginGross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing, the average sales price of our offerings, manufacturing-related costs, including costs associated with the introduction of additional contract manufacturing capacity, merchant silicon costs, supply chain sourcing and the mix of products sold. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time, depending on the factors described above and others. Operating ExpensesOur operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation and travel expenses. We expect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business.Research and Development ExpensesResearch and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, with the remainder being prototype expenses, third-party engineering and contractor support costs, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs and depreciation. Our research and development efforts are focused on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development, including new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and applications. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership.Sales and Marketing ExpensesSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and also include costs related to marketing and promotional activities, with the remainder being an allocated portion of facility and IT costs and depreciation. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide and expand our relationships with current and future channel partners and end customers.General and Administrative ExpensesGeneral and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, legal and professional fees, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs and depreciation. General and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive, finance, human resources and legal functions. Our professional services costs are primarily due to external legal, accounting, and tax services. Other Income (Expense), NetInterest Expense Interest expense consists primarily of interest expense from our lease financing obligation. In fiscal 2014, interest expense also included interest expense on our subordinated convertible promissory notes, including our related party subordinated convertible promissory notes which were converted during fiscal 2014. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income on marketable securities and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. In addition, during fiscal 2014, other income (expense) consisted of gains on investments, and write-offs of debt discount on 49notes payable which were repaid and converted during fiscal 2014. We expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Provision for Income TaxesWe operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to U.S. income tax. Generally, our U.S. tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these earnings which avoids double taxation. Our tax expense to date consists of federal, state and foreign current and deferred income taxes.50Results of OperationsThe following table summarizes historical results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of revenue for those periods.

The increase during the period was primarily driven by increased shipments to our existing customers as they continue to grow and expand their businesses, increasing their demand for our products and related accessories. The introduction of new products contributed to our revenue growth, both with existing and new customers. As of December 31, 2016, we have shipped more than 10 million cumulative cloud networking ports worldwide and our overall end-customer base has exceeded 4,200. Service revenue increased 48.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand. We also continued to experience pressure in product and service pricing due to competitive market conditions. However, this pricing pressure was more than offset by the increased demand drivers outlined above.Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of revenue increased $112.0 million or 38.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in product shipment volumes. In addition, we incurred increased costs as we added capacity to our manufacturing and operations infrastructure. Gross margin decreased from 64.9% to 64.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease during the period was primarily the result of changes in customer mix as we expanded our business including increased contributions from larger customers who typically receive higher discount levels, and increased costs associated with the expansion of manufacturing and operations capacity. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by improved service margins as we scale our services business. We expect our gross margins in the first quarter of 2017 will reflect some further increases in product costs as we continue to invest in expanded contract manufacturing and supply chain operations.53Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Change in $ % ofrevenue $ % ofrevenue $ %Operating expenses: Research and development$273,581 24.2% $209,448 25.0% $64,133 30.6 %Sales and marketing130,887 11.6 109,084 13.0 21,803 20.0General and administrative75,239 6.7 75,720 9.0 (481) (0.6)Total operating expenses$479,707 42.5% $394,252 47.0% $85,455 21.7 %Research and development. Research and development expenses increased $64.1 million, or 30.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $31.2 million resulting from an increase in compensation costs, including stock-based compensation and corporate bonus expense, primarily driven by headcount growth. Prototype spend and third-party engineering and consulting costs increased by $27.3 million, related to additional outsourced development projects, increased internal development activity related to new products and increased costs associated with litigation-related changes in product design. Facilities and IT infrastructure costs increased $3.1 million primarily due to continued expansion and support of our research and development activities.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses increased $21.8 million, or 20.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $21.0 million, reflecting increased compensation costs, including sales incentive compensation and corporate bonus expense, primarily driven by headcount growth and higher sales volumes. In addition, sales and customer engineering consulting expenses mostly related to international expansion increased by $1.3 million, and marketing promotion, trade shows and events increased by $1.1 million, as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in product field demonstration costs of $1.7 million primarily related to significant costs incurred in the previous year due to several next generation product transitions.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses decreased $(0.5) million, or (0.6)%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in litigation expenses of $5.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This decrease was primarily related to the timing of litigation activities associated with the Cisco and OptumSoft legal matters outlined in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This decrease was largely offset by an increase in personnel costs of $4.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This reflects increased compensation costs, including increased stock-based compensation and corporate bonus expense, primarily driven by headcount growth.Other Income (Expense), Net (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Change in 2016 2015 $ %Other income (expense), net: Interest expense$(3,136) $(3,152) $16 (0.5)%Other income (expense), net1,952 (147) 2,099 (1,427.9)Total other income (expense), net$(1,184) $(3,299) $2,115 (64.1)%Other income (expense), net improved during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a net increase in interest income as we expanded our marketable securities portfolio.

The change in our provision was primarily due to an increase in profit before income taxes. The increase in the provision was also a result of additional state and foreign taxes, non-deductible permanent differences, offset by a shift in the geographic foreign 54earnings mix taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. tax rate.

We increased shipments to our existing customers during the year as they continued to grow their businesses and increase their demand for our products and related accessories. In addition, we continued to add new customers as we expanded our market presence and geographic footprint. Service revenue increased 76.4% in the year ended December 31, 2015 with growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand. We also continued to experience fluctuations in product and service pricing due to competitive market pressures. However, these were more than offset by the increased demand drivers outlined above.Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Gross margin decreased from 67.1% to 64.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. This decrease in 2015 was primarily due to increased inventory-related obsolescence charges associated with upcoming product transitions and higher warranty costs, in addition to a greater mix of revenue from larger customers who typically receive higher discounts.

The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $33.3 million, resulting from headcount growth, which drove an increase in compensation, including stock based compensation, as well as additional bonus expense under our corporate bonus plan. Prototype spend and third-party engineering and consulting costs increased by $14.2 million, and facilities and IT infrastructure costs increased $8.6 million due to new product introductions and the continued expansion and support of our research and development activities.Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased $23.7 million, or 27.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $17.0 million, resulting from increased compensation, including sales commissions, which was driven by headcount growth and higher sales volumes. The increase also related to additional product field demonstration costs of $6.0 million.General and administrativeGeneral and administrative expenses increased $43.4 million, or 134.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014. The increase was due to an increase in legal fees of $39.8 million primarily related to the Cisco and OptumSoft legal matters outlined in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition, personnel costs increased by $4.1 million primarily reflecting additional corporate bonus expense and increased stock-based compensation charges during 2015.Other Income (Expense), Net (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Change in 2015 2014 $ %Other income (expense), net: Interest expense$(3,152) $(6,280) $3,128 (49.8)%Other income (expense), net(147) 2,275 (2,422) (106.5)Total other income (expense), net$(3,299) $(4,005) $706 (17.6)%Interest expense. The reduction in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to the same period in 2014 is primarily related to repayment and conversion of our notes payable upon closing of our initial public offering during the second quarter of 2014. Other income (expense), net. The unfavorable change in other income (expense), net during the year ended December 31, 2015, compared to the same period in 2014 was primarily due to a one-time gain on our notes receivable of $4.0 million in 2014, partially offset by a $0.7 million write-off related to the debt discount on notes payable during the second quarter of 2014, and a reduction in transactional exchange rate losses during 2015.Provision for Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, Change in 2015 2014 $ %Provision for income taxes$24,907 $34,658 $(9,751) (28.1)%Effective tax rate17.1% 28.5% Provision for income taxes was approximately $24.9 million and $34.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The decrease in our provision was the result of foreign mix earnings taxed at a lower rate than the US tax rate, release of reserves due to expiration of the statute of limitations in certain domestic jurisdictions, and reinstatement of the federal R&D credit during 2015. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the provision due to increased profit before income taxes.Liquidity and Capital ResourcesOur principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2016, cash and cash equivalents were $567.9 million, of which approximately $111.7 million was held outside the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries. We have not repatriated nor do we currently have plans to repatriate these funds, but if we were to repatriate cash held outside of the U.S. for domestic cash operations, we would be required to accrue and pay U.S. income taxes to repatriate these funds less any previously paid foreign income taxes. We consider the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no U.S. income taxes have been provided thereon.Our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for the foreseeable future. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the 56timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, our costs associated with supply chain activities and manufacturing operations, our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies, the continued market acceptance of our products, and costs incurred related to outstanding litigation claims. If we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 (in thousands)Cash provided by operating activities $131,440 $200,533 $131,875Cash provided by (used in) investing activities (325,979) 184,170 (249,362)Cash provided by financing activities 75,600 63,105 243,978Effect of exchange rate changes (464) (513) (124)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $(119,403) $447,295 $126,367Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesOur primary source of cash from operating activities has been from cash collections from our customers. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increased sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs, inventory purchases from our contract manufacturer, investment in research and development, and litigation expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $131.4 million, primarily from net income of $184.2 million with non-cash adjustments to net income of $15.7 million, partially offset by a net decrease in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $68.4 million. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements with accounts receivable up $108.9 million, inventories up $144.4 million and inventory deposits (included in prepaid expenses and other assets) up $63.1 million. These increases reflect substantial growth in the business and the expansion of our manufacturing and supply chain activities at our new contract manufacturer. These working capital increases were partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $176.1 million reflecting ongoing growth in service and support contracts and a significant increase in product deferred revenue related to contract acceptance terms. Other significant changes in operating assets and liabilities largely related to the overall growth of the business including an increase in accounts payable of $38.7 million, an increase in income taxes payable of $42.7 million, an increase in accrued liabilities of $30.6 million offset by further increases in prepaid expenses and current assets of $54.8 million which was primarily driven by an increase in deferred cost of inventory associated with the increased product revenue deferrals referenced above. During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $200.5 million, primarily from net income of $121.1 million, net non-cash charges of ($1.2) million, and a net increase in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $80.6 million. The net increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of $90.3 million, largely related to short and long-term services contracts and product revenue deferrals related to contracts with acceptance terms. In addition, we experienced an increase in cash of $32.0 million from income taxes payable and an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $29.4 million due to the timing of payments. These operating liability increases were offset by an increase in our accounts receivable of $47.3 million resulting from an increase in sales during the period. In addition, inventory increased $14.1 million during the period due to higher shipment volume, and prepaid expenses and current assets increased $7.8 million in the period.During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by operating activities was $131.9 million primarily from net income of $86.9 million, net non-cash charges of $11.0 million, and an increase of $33.2 million due to changes in our operating assets and liabilities. The increase in cash from operating assets and liabilities was primarily due an increase in deferred revenue of $47.6 million resulting from the increase in sales, an increase in accrued liabilities of $18.9 million largely related to our payroll and corporate bonus plan and an increase in accounts payable of $14.0 million due to the timing of our payments, partially offset by a reduction in cash from an increase in accounts receivable of $19.0 million from higher products shipments, an increase in inventories of $13.4 million to meet our customer demand, an increase of $15.3 million in cash paid for income taxes, and supplier rebates receivable resulting from our increased inventory purchases.57Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities have consisted primarily of capital expenditures and net investment purchases of available for sale marketable securities. We expect to continue investing in these activities to support the continued growth of our business.During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in investing activities was $326.0 million, consisting of purchases of available-for-sale securities of $439.7 million, purchases of property, equipment and other assets of $21.4 million, and an additional investment in a privately held company of $2.5 million. Cash used was offset by cash provided by proceeds from the maturity of available-for-sale securities of $137.9 million.During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by investing activities was $184.2 million, consisting of proceeds from the maturity of available-for-sale securities of $208.2 million, offset by purchases of property, equipment and other assets of $19.2 million and increase in restricted cash of $4.0 million related to a security deposit required for a facility lease.During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash used in investing activities was $249.4 million, consisting primarily of purchases of marketable securities of $210.0 million, purchases of property and equipment of $13.1 million and other investing activities of $38.2 million largely due to a $33.6 million equity investments in privately held companies, partially offset by the proceeds of the repayments of our notes receivable of $8.0 million and the release of our restricted cash into cash and cash equivalents of $4.0 million. Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by financing activities was $75.6 million, consisting primarily of the excess tax benefit associated with equity incentive plans of $42.9 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of repurchases, of $24.9 million, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our ESPP of $10.3 million.During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $63.1 million, consisting primarily of the excess tax benefit associated with equity incentive plans of $37.3 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of repurchases of $17.8 million and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our ESPP of $9.4 million.During the year ended December 31, 2014, cash provided by financing activities was $244.0 million, consisting primarily of net proceeds raised from our initial public offering of $239.3 million, proceeds from the exercise of stock options, net of repurchases of $8.0 million and excess tax benefits from our equity incentive plans amounting to $17.4 million. These proceeds were partially offset by the repayment of our notes payable of $20.0 million. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2016, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Contractual Obligations and Commitments Our contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. Our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future obligations with terms in excess of one year. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing cash balances. The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than5 YearsFinancing lease obligation(1) $43,626 $5,933 $12,406 $13,151 $12,136Operating lease obligations 50,131 7,867 14,262 12,256 15,746Non-cancelable purchase obligations 261,868 261,868 — — Total $355,625 $275,668 $26,668 $25,407 $27,882_________________(1) Includes interest and land lease The contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of $16.1 million related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments.58Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are the following:Revenue RecognitionWe generate revenue from sales of our products which incorporate our EOS software and accessories such as cables and optics to direct customers and channel partners together with post contract customer support (“PCS”). We typically sell products and PCS in a single transaction. We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery or performance has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. We define each of the four criteria above as follows: •Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Evidence of an arrangement consists of stand-alone purchase orders or purchase orders issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a master sales agreement. It is our practice to identify an end customer prior to shipment to a reseller or distributor. • Delivery or performance has occurred. We use shipping documents or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. We recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which primarily is upon shipment to customers. We generally do not have significant obligations for future performance, rights of return, or pricing credits associated with our product sales. In instances where substantive acceptance provisions are specified in the customer arrangement, revenue and deferred cost of revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met.•The sales price is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. •Collectability is reasonably assured. We assess probability of collectability on a customer-by-customer basis. Our customers and channel partners are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates their financial condition and ability to pay for products and services. PCS is offered under renewable, fee-based contracts, which includes technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty, bug fixes, patches and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis. We initially defer PCS revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the PCS contract, with the related expenses recognized as incurred. PCS contracts usually have a term of one to three years. We include billed but unearned PCS revenue in deferred revenue. We report revenue net of sales taxes. We include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold. Multiple-Element Arrangements Most of our arrangements, other than renewals of PCS, are multiple element arrangements with a combination of products and PCS. Products and PCS generally qualify as separate units of accounting. Our hardware deliverables include EOS software, which together deliver the essential functionality of our products. For multiple element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. The relative selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), if available; third-party evidence (“TPE”), if VSOE is not available; and best estimate of selling price (“BESP”), if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. As we have not been able to establish VSOE or TPE for our products and most of our services, we generally utilize BESP for the purposes of allocating revenue to each unit of accounting. •VSOE—We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific products and services when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the stand-alone selling prices fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. • TPE—When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple-element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for interchangeable products or services when sold separately to similarly situated customers. However, as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and offer substantially different features and functionality, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. Additionally, as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products’ selling prices are on a stand-alone basis, we are not able to obtain reliable evidence of TPE of selling price. 59•BESP—When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. BESP is based on considering multiple factors including, but not limited to the sales channel (reseller, distributor or end customer), the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international) and size of the end customer. We limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations, or subject to customer-specific return, acceptance or refund privileges. We account for multiple agreements with a single partner as 1 arrangement if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single arrangement. We may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is no contractual provision for such returns. We estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against current-period gross revenues. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the ""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which replaces current revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2014-09 requires revenue to be recognized when a customer obtains control of the promised goods or services. The amount of revenue recognized is limited to the final consideration received in exchange for the goods and services. Management’s assessments of the potential impacts of the standard is underway. The standard is expected to impact the amount and timing of revenue recognized and the related disclosures on our consolidated financial statements. We will adopt ASU 2014-09 during the first quarter of 2018 and we expect to adopt this new standard using the modified retrospective method that will result in a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date of adoption.Inventory Valuation and Contract Manufacturer/Supplier LiabilitiesInventories primarily consist of finished goods purchased from third party contract manufacturers and are stated at the lower of cost (computed using the first-in, first-out method) or market value. Manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory. In addition, we purchase strategic component inventory from certain suppliers under purchase commitments that in some cases are non-cancelable, including integrated circuits, which are held by our contract manufacturers. We record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand, or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value. We also record a liability for non-cancelable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our component inventory suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete.Our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts. We generally incur a liability when the contract manufacturer has converted the component inventory to a finished product. Historically, we have reimbursed our contract manufacturer for component inventory that has been rendered excess or obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes, or in cases where inventory levels greatly exceed our forecasts. We use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures. These estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers, product development plans and current sales levels. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities.WarrantyWe offer a one-year warranty on all of our hardware products and a 90-day warranty against defects in the software embedded in the products. We use judgment and estimates when determining warranty costs based on historical costs to replace product returns within the warranty period at the time we recognize revenue. We accrue for potential warranty claims at the time of shipment as a component of cost of revenues based on historical experience and other relevant information. We reserve for specifically identified products if and when we determine we have a systemic product failure. Although we engage in extensive product quality programs, if actual product failure rates or use of materials differ from estimates, additional warranty costs may be incurred, which could reduce our gross margin. The accrued warranty liability is recorded in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Stock-Based CompensationCompensation expense related to stock-based transactions, including stock options, restricted stock units (""RSUs""), restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), and stock purchase rights under our employee stock purchase program is measured and recognized in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity granted. Stock-based compensation expense is generally recognized on a straight-line basis, net of estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service periods of the awards, which typically ranges from two to five years. The assumptions used in our option-pricing model represent management’s best estimates. These estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management’s judgment. If factors change and different assumptions are used, our stock-based 60compensation expense could be materially different in the future. These assumptions and estimates are as follows:Fair ValueThe fair value of stock options are estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option-pricing model. This model requires the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term of the option and the expected volatility of the price of our common stock. Expected Term The expected term represents the period that our equity grants are expected to be outstanding. For option grants that are considered to be “simple,” we used the simplified method to determine the expected term which calculates the expected term as the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options. For option grants that are not considered “simple,” the expected term is based on historical option exercise behavior and post-vesting cancellations of options by employees. For ESPP grants, the expected term is based on the length of the each purchase period with an offering period.Expected VolatilityOur volatility has historically been derived from the average historical stock volatilities of a peer group of public companies within our industry that we consider to be comparable to our business over a period equivalent to the expected term of the stock-based grants. In late 2016, as sufficient but limited historical information became available, we transitioned our expected volatility model to include a combination of our peer group, and the limited historical and implied volatility of our common stock. In addition to the assumptions used above, we have through fiscal 2016 applied an estimated forfeiture rate to calculate the stock-based compensation expense for our equity awards. Our forfeiture rate is based on an analysis of our actual forfeitures. We account for forfeitures as they occur and calculate a cumulative adjustment as it relates to equity transactions where prior forfeitures rates have previously and cumulatively been applied. Income TaxesIncome tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes.We account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements, but have not been reflected in our taxable income. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. We believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.We regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized. We recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and to the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense.Loss ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are a party to claims and legal proceedings including matters relating to commercial, employee relations, business practices and intellectual property. In assessing loss contingencies, we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss, impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We will record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.61Recent Accounting PronouncementsRefer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.62Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and investments in privately held companies. Foreign Currency Exchange RiskOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars. Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe and Asia. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. The effect of an immediate 10% adverse change in foreign exchange rates on monetary assets and liabilities at December 31, 2016 would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Interest Rate SensitivityOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash and cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities. Our cash and cash equivalents are held in cash deposits, money market funds with maturities of less than 90 days from the date of purchase. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the U.S. However, because of the conservative and short-term nature of the instruments in our portfolio, a sudden change in market interest rates would not be expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $299.9 million invested in available-for-sale marketable securities. The effect of an immediate 10% change in interest rates at December 31, 2016 would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows. As of December 31, 2016, we did not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes.Investments in Privately Held CompaniesOur non-marketable equity investments in privately held companies are recorded in investments, non-current in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using the cost method. As of December 31, 2016, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was $36.1 million.Some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.63Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:22:12.345178

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Overview We are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of large-scale Internet companies, cloud service providers and next-generation data centers for enterprise support. Our cloud networking solutions consist of our Extensible Operating System, or EOS, a set of network applications and our Ethernet switching and routing platforms. Our cloud networking solutions deliver industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility. At the core of our cloud networking platform is EOS, which was purpose-built to be fully programmable and highly modular. The programmability of EOS has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking, including workflow automation, network visibility and analytics, and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services.We believe that cloud networks will continue to replace legacy network technologies, and that our cloud networking platform addresses the large and growing cloud networking segment of data center switching, which remains in the early stage of adoption. Cloud networks are subject to increasing performance requirements due to the growing number of connected devices, as well as new enterprise and consumer applications. Computing architectures are evolving to meet the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications. We expect to continue growing our organization to meet the needs of new and existing customers as they increasingly realize the performance and cost benefits of our cloud networking solutions and as they expand their cloud networks. Accordingly, we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications.We generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our EOS software. We generate the majority of our services revenue from post contract support, or PCS, which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products. Our end customers span a range of industries and include large Internet companies, service providers, financial services organizations, government agencies, media and entertainment companies and others. As we have grown the functionality of our EOS software, expanded the range of our product portfolio and increased the size of our sales force, our revenue has continued to grow rapidly. We have also been profitable and operating cash flow positive for each year since 2010.To continue to grow our revenue, it is important that we both obtain new customers and sell additional products to existing customers. We expect that a substantial portion of our future sales will be follow-on sales to existing customers. We intend to continue expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies, as well as our relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners in order to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers, and provide services and support effectively. In order to support our strong growth, we have and may continue to accelerate our investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations.Our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our EOS software and enhancements to EOS. We engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture. Today, we combine our EOS software with merchant silicon into a family of switching and routing products. This enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions. 43Table of ContentsWe currently procure certain merchant silicon components from multiple vendors, and we continue to expand our relationships with these and other vendors. We work closely with third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. Our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third party direct fulfillment facilities. We and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers.Historically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for significant portion of our revenue. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing of large orders, especially with respect to our large end customers, due to the complexity of orders, the time it takes end customers to evaluate, test, qualify and accept our products and factors specific to our end customers. Due to these factors, we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. In addition, we have provided, and may in the future provide, pricing discounts to large end customers, which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur. Our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers.Furthermore, to comply with the limited exclusion order and cease and desist order in the 945 Investigation as described in Note 5 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K, entitled Commitments and Contingencies, we have made design changes to our products for sale in the United States to address the features that were found to infringe the patent claims underlying the remedial orders in the 945 Investigation. We have also worked closely with our customers on the qualification and testing of our redesigned products. The timing of the completion of these qualification activities for a few of our larger customers has extended beyond year end and this has impacted our business. We continue to work with these customers to complete these procedures and improve the redesigns in order to meet customer requirements. We will need to complete any outstanding product modifications and qualification and acceptance processes for these customers and any inability to do so in a timely manner may result in an impact to our business, our revenue and our deferred revenue balances. We also filed a motion with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the ""CAFC"") requesting that they stay the orders of the United States International Trade Commission (“USITC”), pending completion of the appeals of the decisions of the United States Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”), and sought an expedited schedule for those appeals. On September 22, 2017, the CAFC denied the motion to stay, but has allowed us to import its redesigned products into the United States without being blocked by the USITC’s orders, subject to any determinations by the USITC in subsequent proceedings regarding the redesigned products. On October 27, 2017, the USITC instituted a modification proceeding to determine whether our redesigned products infringe the patent claims underlying the remedial orders in the 945 Investigation. The USITC has set a deadline of five months for the ALJ to issue a recommended determination, which may be extended by one month upon a showing of good cause. The recommended determination will be subject to review by the Commission after which the Commission will issue a final determination. The Commission has not set a target date for the final determination. The hearing was held on January 26, 2018.44Table of ContentsResults of OperationsThe following table summarizes historical results of operations for the periods presented and as a percentage of revenue for those periods.

We also derive a portion of our revenue from sales of PCS, which is typically purchased in conjunction with our products, and subsequent renewals of those contracts. We expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing and size of orders, the delivery and acceptance of products, and the impact of significant transactions with unique terms and conditions that may require deferral of revenue. Product revenue increased $441.5 million, or 44.5%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by increased product shipments to our existing customers as they continued to expand their businesses. In addition, our newer switch products have continued to gain market acceptance, which has contributed to our revenue growth. Service revenue increased $75.5 million, or 54.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand. We continue to experience pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition, but demand for our products and growth in our installed base has more than offset this pricing pressure. Deferred product revenue at December 31, 2017 remained consistent with the balance at December 31, 2016. The deferred product revenue balance at December 31, 2016 primarily included customer arrangements with new product and new customer acceptance clauses, which expired during the current year, while the balance at December 31, 2017 primarily represents arrangements with a few of our larger customers related to the ongoing qualification activities of our 945 investigation-related product redesigns. As we enter 2018, we expect to continue to work with these customers to complete their qualification activities, which may impact our business.Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our third-party contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors, overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department, and other manufacturing-related costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory. We expect our cost of product revenue to increase as our product revenue increases. Cost of providing PCS and other services consists primarily of personnel costs for our global customer support organization. Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing, manufacturing-related costs including costs associated with supply chain sourcing activities, merchant silicon costs, the mix of products sold, and excess/obsolete inventory write-downs, including charges for excess/obsolete component inventory held by our contract manufacturers. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time, depending on the factors described above and others.Cost of revenue increased $178.4 million or 43.9% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in product shipment volumes and the corresponding increase in product revenue. Gross margin increased from 64.0% to 64.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by improved service margins as we scaled our services business on a relatively fixed cost base and slightly better product margins due to end customer mix. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in excess and obsolete inventory-related charges as we transition to new products.Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages)Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation and travel expenses. We expect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business.

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, prototype expenses, third-party engineering and contractor support costs, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs including depreciation. Our research and development efforts are focused on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development, including new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and applications. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute 47Table of Contentsdollars as we continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership.Research and development expenses increased $76.0 million, or 27.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $36.9 million increase in personnel costs driven by headcount growth, resulting in additional compensation costs including stock-based compensation, and a $31.6 million increase in prototype and third-party engineering costs driven by additional outsourced development projects and costs associated with litigation-related changes in product design. In addition, facility and IT costs increase by $5.3 million due to the headcount growth.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, marketing and promotional activities, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs including depreciation. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide.Sales and marketing expenses increased $24.2 million, or 18.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The increase included a $15.4 million increase in personnel costs, which was primarily due to increased headcount as well as higher sales volumes, driving increased compensation costs, including commissions and stock-based compensation. In addition, sales support costs increased by $8.1 million compared to 2016, reflecting increased professional services and field demonstration costs to support our sales infrastructure and expand our customer base.General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of Cisco and Optumsoft litigation related expenses, personnel costs, professional services fees, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs including depreciation. General and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive, finance, human resources and legal functions. Our professional services fees are primarily due to external legal, accounting, and tax services. We expect our general and administrative expenses to fluctuate in absolute dollars from period to period depending on the timing and progress of our litigation activities.General and administrative expenses increased $11.6 million, or 15.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in the Cisco litigation related expenses, which included bond costs associated with the importation and sale of affected products and components during the presidential review period of the 945 Investigation. In addition, personnel costs increased by $3.9 million primarily due to increased stock-based compensation and higher salary related costs driven by increased headcount.Other Income (Expense), Net (in thousands, except percentages)Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income from our cash equivalents and marketable securities, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, and interest expense on our lease financing obligation. We expect our interest income to grow in 2018 as we continue to grow our cash balance and invest our excess cash in marketable securities. We expect our foreign currency gains and losses to continue to fluctuate in the future due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates.

Provision for Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may be subject to U.S. income tax. Generally, our U.S. tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these earnings which avoids double taxation. Our tax expense to date consists of federal, state and foreign current and deferred income taxes.48Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change in $ % ofRevenue $ % ofRevenue $ %Provision for income taxes $51,559 3.1% $58,036 5.1% $(6,477) (11.2)Effective tax rate 10.9% 24.0% Our provision for income taxes was approximately $51.6 million and $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate from 24.0% in 2016 to 10.9% in 2017. The reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of $110.0 million of excess tax benefits on share-based awards in the provision for income taxes as a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2017, combined with a favorable geographical mix of our earnings towards jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the U.S. These positive drivers were partially offset by the inclusion of provisional tax amount totaling $51.8 million resulting from the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Tax Act makes significant changes to the U.S. tax code, which include, but are not limited to, a U.S. federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and a shift to a modified territorial tax regime, which requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of the cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had not yet completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. As a result, we recorded a provisional tax amount of $18.8 million for the transition tax and a provisional tax amount of $33.0 million related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future.We will continue to refine our estimates related to the impact of the Tax Act during the one year measurement period allowed under Staff Accounting Bulletin 118 (“SAB 118”). In addition, our future effective tax rate is anticipated to fluctuate as a result of excess tax benefits to be included in the income tax provision.

The increase during the period was primarily driven by increased shipments to our existing customers as they continue to grow and expand their businesses, increasing their demand for our products and related accessories. The introduction of new products contributed to our revenue growth, both with existing and new customers. Service revenue increased 48.7% in the year ended December 31, 2016 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand. We also continued to experience 49Table of Contentspressure in product and service pricing due to competitive market conditions. However, this pricing pressure was more than offset by the increased demand drivers outlined above.Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of revenue increased $112.0 million or 38.1% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in product shipment volumes. In addition, we incurred increased costs as we added capacity to our manufacturing and operations infrastructure. Gross margin decreased from 64.9% to 64.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease during the period was primarily the result of changes in customer mix as we expanded our business including increased contributions from larger customers who typically receive higher discount levels, and increased costs associated with the expansion of manufacturing and operations capacity. These unfavorable changes were partially offset by improved service margins as we scale our services business.

Prototype spend and third-party engineering and consulting costs increased by $27.3 million, related to additional outsourced development projects, increased internal development activity related to new products and increased costs associated with litigation-related changes in product design. Facilities and IT infrastructure costs increased $3.1 million primarily due to continued expansion and support of our research and development activities.Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased $21.8 million, or 20.0% for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs of $21.0 million, reflecting increased compensation costs, including sales incentive compensation and corporate bonus expense, primarily driven by headcount growth and higher sales volumes. In addition, sales and customer engineering consulting expenses mostly related to international expansion increased by $1.3 million, and marketing promotion, trade shows and events increased by $1.1 million, as compared to the same period in 2015. The increase was partially offset by a decrease in product field demonstration costs of $1.7 million primarily related to significant costs incurred in the previous year due to several next generation product transitions.General and administrativeGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $(0.5) million, or (0.6)%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to the same period in 2015. The decrease was primarily due to a reduction in litigation expenses of $5.6 million during the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This decrease was primarily related to the timing of litigation activities associated with the Cisco and OptumSoft legal matters outlined in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. This decrease was largely offset by an increase in personnel costs of $4.9 million in the year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to the same period in 2015. This reflects increased compensation costs, including increased stock-based compensation and corporate bonus expense, primarily driven by headcount growth.50Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense), Net (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Change in $ % ofRevenue $ % ofRevenue $ %Other income (expense), net: Interest expense $(3,136) (0.3)% $(3,152) (0.4)% $16 (0.5)%Other income (expense), net 1,952 0.2 (147) — 2,099 (1,427.9)Total other income (expense), net $(1,184) (0.1)% $(3,299) (0.4)% $2,115 (64.1)%Other income (expense), net improved during the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to 2015 primarily due to a net increase in interest income as we expanded our marketable securities portfolio.Provision for Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Change in $ % ofRevenue $ % ofRevenue $ %Provision for income taxes $58,036 5.1% $24,907 3.0% $33,129 133.0%Effective tax rate 24.0% 17.1% Provision for income taxes was approximately $58.0 million and $24.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change in our provision was primarily due to an increase in profit before income taxes. The increase in the provision was also a result of additional state and foreign taxes, non-deductible permanent differences, offset by a shift in the geographic foreign earnings mix taxed at a lower rate than the U.S. tax rate. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2017, our total balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $1.5 billion, of which approximately $118.0 million was held outside the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries. The Tax Act included a one-time transition tax on unremitted foreign earnings, and accordingly, we recorded tax expense of $18.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to the transition tax on the one-time mandatory deemed repatriation of all our foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information on income taxes.Our cash, cash equivalents and securities are held for working capital purposes. Our marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly-rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We believe that our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, our costs associated with supply chain activities, including access to outsourced manufacturing, our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies, the continued market acceptance of our products, and costs incurred related to outstanding litigation claims. If we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in thousands)Cash provided by operating activities $631,627 $174,295 $237,784Cash provided by (used in) investing activities (392,580) (325,979) 184,170Cash provided by financing activities 51,469 32,745 25,854Effect of exchange rate changes 753 (464) (513)Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $291,269 $(119,403) $447,29551Table of ContentsCash Flows from Operating ActivitiesOur primary source of cash provided by operating activities has been cash collections from our customers. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increased sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs, inventory purchases from our contract manufacturers, investment in research and development, and litigation expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $631.6 million, primarily from net income of $423.2 million with non-cash adjustments to net income of $105.9 million, and a net increase of $102.5 million in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Our operating cash benefited $142.3 million from increased deferred revenue reflecting ongoing growth in service and support contracts, $43.5 million from increased accrued liabilities driven by increased inventory purchases and product development activities, and $19.9 million from increased income taxes payable. These favorable changes were partially offset by a growth in inventory of $69.7 million, supporting overall growth in the business and the expansion of our manufacturing and supply chain activities, by a decline in accounts payable of $30.1 million due to timing of vendor payments primarily related to inventory purchases, and by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $11.6 million primarily due to increased prepaid taxes.During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $174.3 million, primarily from net income of $184.2 million with non-cash adjustments to net income of $58.6 million, partially offset by a net decrease in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $68.4 million. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements with accounts receivable up $108.9 million, inventories and inventory deposits up $207.5 million, and increased prepaid expenses and current assets (excluding inventory deposits) of $54.8 million which was primarily driven by an increase in deferred cost of inventory associated with increased product revenue deferrals referenced below. These increases reflect substantial growth in the business and the expansion of our manufacturing and supply chain activities at our new contract manufacturer. These working capital increases were partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $176.1 million reflecting ongoing growth in service and support contracts and a significant increase in product deferred revenue related to contract acceptance terms, as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $69.3 million primarily due to timing of inventory purchases, and an increase in income taxes payable of $42.7 million. During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by operating activities was $237.8 million, primarily from net income of $121.1 million with non-cash adjustments to net income of $36.0 million, and a net increase in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $80.6 million. The net increase in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in deferred revenue of $90.3 million, largely related to short and long-term services contracts and product revenue deferrals related to contracts with acceptance terms. In addition, we experienced an increase in cash of $32.0 million from income taxes payable and an increase in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $29.4 million due to the timing of payments. These operating liability increases were offset by an increase in our accounts receivable of $47.3 million and an increase in inventory of $14.1 million due to increased business volume and timing, and prepaid expenses and current assets increased $7.8 million in the period.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of available for sale marketable securities, net of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, and capital expenditures. We expect to continue investing in these activities to support the continued growth of our business.During the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used in investing activities was $392.6 million, consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $585.4 million, purchases of property, equipment and other assets of $15.3 million, partially offset by proceeds of $206.3 million from maturities of marketable securities and proceeds of $3.0 million from repayment of notes receivable.During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in investing activities was $326.0 million, consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $439.7 million, purchases of property, equipment and other assets of $21.4 million, and an additional investment in a privately held company of $2.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by proceeds from the maturity of available-for-sale securities of $137.9 million.During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by investing activities was $184.2 million, consisting of proceeds from the maturity of available-for-sale securities of $208.2 million, partially offset by purchases of property, equipment and other assets of $19.2 million and an increase in restricted cash of $4.0 million related to a security deposit required for a facility lease.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesOur financing activities have consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under employee equity incentive plans, offset by principal payments for lease financing obligations related to our headquarters facility.During the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by financing activities was $51.5 million, consisting primarily of proceeds of $44.6 million from employee stock option exercises, partially offset by $4.0 million of minimum tax withheld for employees, and proceeds of $12.5 million from employee stock purchases under our ESPP, partially offset by payments of $1.6 million for lease financing obligations.52Table of ContentsDuring the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by financing activities was $32.7 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $24.9 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our ESPP of $10.3 million, partially offset by payments of $1.3 million for lease financing obligations.During the year ended December 31, 2015, cash provided by financing activities was $25.9 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $17.8 million and the proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our ESPP of $9.4 million, partially offset by payments of $1.1 million for lease financing obligations.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2017, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsOur contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. Our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future payment obligations. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing balances of cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities. The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than5 YearsFinancing lease obligation (1) $37,692 $6,113 $12,770 $13,545 $5,264Operating lease obligations 51,004 9,127 16,686 15,318 9,873Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 147,854 147,854 — — —Other non-cancellable purchase obligations 47,250 47,250 — — Total $283,800 $210,344 $29,456 $28,863 $15,137_________________(1) Includes interest and land lease.The contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of $37.9 million related to uncertain tax positions and the transition tax due under the Tax Act because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are the following:Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from sales of our products which incorporate our EOS software and accessories such as cables and optics to direct customers and channel partners together with post contract customer support (“PCS”). We typically sell products and PCS in a single transaction. We recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery or performance has occurred; the sales price is fixed or determinable; and collectability is reasonably assured. We define each of the four criteria above as follows: •Persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists. Evidence of an arrangement consists of stand-alone purchase orders or purchase orders issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a master sales agreement. It is our practice to identify an end customer prior to shipment to a reseller or distributor. • Delivery or performance has occurred. We use shipping documents or written evidence of customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery or performance. We recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss, which primarily is upon shipment to customers. We generally do not have significant obligations for future performance, rights of 53Table of Contentsreturn, or pricing credits associated with our product sales. In instances where substantive acceptance provisions are specified in the customer arrangement, revenue and deferred cost of revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met.•The sales price is fixed or determinable. We assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. •Collectability is reasonably assured. We assess probability of collectability on a customer-by-customer basis. Our customers and channel partners are subjected to a credit review process that evaluates their financial condition and ability to pay for products and services. PCS, which includes technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty, bug fixes, patches and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis, is offered under renewable, fee-based contracts. We initially defer PCS revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the PCS contract, with the related expenses recognized as incurred. PCS contracts usually have a term of one to three years. We include billed but unearned PCS revenue in deferred revenue. We report revenue net of sales taxes. We include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of goods sold. Multiple-Element Arrangements Most of our arrangements, other than renewals of PCS, are multiple element arrangements with a combination of products and PCS. Products and PCS generally qualify as separate units of accounting. Our hardware deliverables include EOS software, which together deliver the essential functionality of our products. For multiple element arrangements, we allocate revenue to each unit of accounting based on the relative selling price. The relative selling price for each element is based upon the following hierarchy: vendor-specific objective evidence (“VSOE”), if available; third-party evidence (“TPE”), if VSOE is not available; and best estimate of selling price (“BESP”), if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. As we have not been able to establish VSOE or TPE for our products and most of our services, we generally utilize BESP for the purposes of allocating revenue to each unit of accounting. •VSOE—We determine VSOE based on our historical pricing and discounting practices for the specific products and services when sold separately. In determining VSOE, we require that a substantial majority of the stand-alone selling prices fall within a reasonably narrow pricing range. • TPE—When VSOE cannot be established for deliverables in multiple-element arrangements, we apply judgment with respect to whether we can establish a selling price based on TPE. TPE is determined based on competitor prices for interchangeable products or services when sold separately to similarly situated customers. However, as our products contain a significant element of proprietary technology and offer substantially different features and functionality, the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality typically cannot be obtained. Additionally, as we are unable to reliably determine what competitors products’ selling prices are on a stand-alone basis, we are not able to obtain reliable evidence of TPE of selling price. •BESP—When we are unable to establish selling price using VSOE or TPE, we use BESP in our allocation of arrangement consideration. The objective of BESP is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service was sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. BESP is based on considering multiple factors including, but not limited to the sales channel (reseller, distributor or end customer), the geographies in which our products and services were sold (domestic or international) and size of the end customer. We limit the amount of revenue recognition for delivered elements to the amount that is not contingent on the future delivery of products or services, future performance obligations, or subject to customer-specific return, acceptance or refund privileges. We account for multiple agreements with a single partner as one arrangement if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single arrangement. We may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is no contractual provision for such returns. We estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against current-period gross revenues. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the ""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers,” which replaces primarily all existing revenue recognition guidance under GAAP and establishes common principles for recognizing revenue for all industries. Based on our assessment, we will adopt the new standard in our first quarter of 2018 using the modified retrospective method. We do not expect the impact from adopting the new revenue guidance to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition in the year of adoption. See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Form 10-K for details.Inventory Valuation and Contract Manufacturer/Supplier LiabilitiesInventories primarily consist of finished goods and strategic components, primarily integrated circuits. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed using the first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory. We record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand, or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value.54Table of ContentsOur contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts. We record a liability and a corresponding charge for non-cancellable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers or suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes. We use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures. These estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers, product development plans and current sales levels. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities.Income Taxes Income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes.We account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements, but have not been reflected in our taxable income. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. We believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.We regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized. We recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and to the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense.Loss ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are a party to claims and legal proceedings including matters relating to commercial, employee relations, business practices and intellectual property. In assessing loss contingencies, we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss, impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We will record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRefer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and investments in privately held companies. Foreign Currency Exchange RiskOur results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, our revenue is not directly subject to foreign currency risk. However, we are indirectly exposed to foreign currency risk. A stronger U.S. dollar could make our products and services more expensive in foreign countries and therefore reduce demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. Such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are also influenced by many other factors.Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe and Asia. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the effect of a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would not have had a material impact on our operating results. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date, we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Interest Rate SensitivityAs of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $1.5 billion and $867.8 million, respectively. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in money market funds, corporate bonds, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. treasury securities and commercial papers. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the U.S. A decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income. For the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in overall interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest income. On the other hand, when interest rates rise, our marketable securities purchased at a lower yield would incur a mark-to-market unrealized loss. Under certain circumstances, if we are forced to sell our marketable securities prior to maturity, we may incur realized losses in such investments. However, because of the conservative and short-term nature of the investments in our portfolio, a change in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Investments in Privately Held CompaniesOur non-marketable equity investments in privately held companies are recorded in investments, non-current in our consolidated balance sheets and are accounted for using the cost method. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately held companies was $36.1 million.Some of the privately held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.55Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:22:12.305294

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Overview We are a leading supplier of cloud networking solutions that use software innovations to address the needs of large-scale internet companies, cloud service providers and next-generation data centers and campuses for enterprise support. Our cloud networking solutions consist of our Extensible Operating System, or EOS, a set of network applications and our Ethernet switching and routing platforms. Our cloud networking solutions deliver industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility. At the core of our cloud networking platform is EOS, which was purpose-built to be fully programmable and highly modular. The programmability of EOS has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking, including workflow automation, network visibility and analytics, and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services.We believe that cloud networks will continue to replace legacy network technologies, and that our cloud networking platform addresses the large and growing cloud networking segment of data center switching, which 54Table of Contentsremains in the early stage of adoption. Cloud networks are subject to increasing performance requirements due to the growing number of connected devices, as well as new enterprise and consumer applications. Computing architectures are evolving to meet the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications. We expect to continue growing our organization to meet the needs of new and existing customers as they increasingly realize the performance and cost benefits of our cloud networking solutions and as they expand their cloud networks. Accordingly, we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications.We generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching products which incorporate our EOS software. We generate the majority of our services revenue from post contract support, or PCS, which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products. Our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies, service providers, financial services organizations, government agencies, media and entertainment companies and others. As we have grown the functionality of our EOS software, expanded the range of our product portfolio and increased the size of our sales force, our revenue has continued to grow rapidly. We have also been profitable and operating cash flow positive for each year since 2010.To continue to grow our revenue, it is important that we both obtain new customers and sell additional products to existing customers. We expect that a substantial portion of our future sales will be follow-on sales to existing customers. We intend to continue expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies, as well as our relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners in order to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers, and provide services and support effectively. In order to support our strong growth, we have and may continue to accelerate our investment in infrastructure, such as enterprise resource planning software and other technologies to improve the efficiency of our operations.Our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our EOS software and enhancements to EOS. We engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture. Today, we combine our EOS software with merchant silicon into a family of switching and routing products. This enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions. We currently procure certain merchant silicon components from multiple vendors, and we continue to expand our relationships with these and other vendors. We work closely with third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. Our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third party direct fulfillment facilities. We and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers.Historically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for significant portion of our revenue. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing of large orders, especially with respect to our large end customers, due to the complexity of orders, the time it takes end customers to evaluate, test, qualify and accept our products and factors specific to our end customers. Due to these factors, we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. For example, our sales to Microsoft as an end-user in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, representing 27% of our revenue during fiscal 2018, benefited from certain factors that may not repeat in fiscal 2019 or future fiscal years and the percentage of our revenue from Microsoft in fiscal 2019 may decline. In addition, we have provided, and may in the future provide, pricing discounts to large end customers, which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur. Our gross margins may also fluctuate as a result of the timing of such sales to large end customers.On August 6, 2018, we entered into a binding term sheet with Cisco (the “Term Sheet”). Pursuant to the Term Sheet, we paid Cisco $400.0 million on August 20, 2018, and the Company and Cisco obtained dismissals of all ongoing district court and USITC litigation between us. Cisco granted us a release for all past claims relating to the patents Cisco asserted against us in the district court and USITC, and we granted Cisco a release from all past antitrust and unfair competition claims. These mutual releases extended to the Company's and Cisco’s customers, contract manufacturers, and partners. The parties further agreed to a five-year stand-down period for any utility patent infringement claims either may have against features currently implemented in the other party’s products and services, with some carve-outs for products stemming from acquired companies. The parties further 55Table of Contentsagreed to a three-year dispute resolution process for allegations by either party against new and/or modified features in the other party’s products. We also agreed to make certain modifications to our Command Line Interface (“CLI”). On December 3, 2018, the parties entered into a Mutual Release and Settlement Agreement (the “Definitive Agreement”), which superseded the Term Sheet but did not substantially alter the terms. See Note 14. Legal Settlement of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Furthermore, in order to comply with USITC exclusion and cease and desist orders previously issued in relation to the Cisco legal matter, we made certain design changes to our products for sale in the United States. Following the expiration and invalidation of related patent claims, effective July 1, 2018, certain features previously covered by the orders could be re-incorporated into our products. We are working with customers to complete any remaining re-qualification procedures related to the reintroduction of these features, the timing of which could result in an impact to our revenue and our deferred revenue balances.AcquisitionsOn August 2, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Mojo Networks, Inc., a provider of Cognitive WiFi and cloud-managed wireless networking solutions headquartered in Mountain View, California. We expect to extend our cognitive cloud networking architecture with the addition of Mojo by providing secure, high performance cognitive WiFi at cloud scale. On September 12, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Metamako Holding PTY LTD. Headquartered in Sydney, Australia, Metamako was a leader in solutions for latency sensitive business applications. We expect this acquisition to play a key role in the delivery of our next generation platforms for low-latency applications.Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Change in $ % ofRevenue $ % ofRevenue $ %Revenue Product $1,841,100 85.6% $1,432,810 87.0% $408,290 28.5%Service 310,269 14.4 213,376 13.0 96,893 45.4Total revenue 2,151,369 100.0 1,646,186 100.0 505,183 30.7Cost of revenue Product 720,584 33.5 538,035 32.7 182,549 33.9Service 57,408 2.7 46,382 2.8 11,026 23.8Total cost of revenue 777,992 36.2 584,417 35.5 193,575 33.1Gross profit $1,373,377 63.8% $1,061,769 64.5% $311,608 29.3%Gross margin 63.8% 64.5% 56Table of ContentsRevenue by Geography (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2018 % of Total 2017 % of TotalAmericas $1,550,453 72.1 % $1,192,289 72.4 %Europe, Middle East and Africa 414,069 19.2 299,547 18.2Asia-Pacific 186,847 8.7 154,350 9.4Total revenue $2,151,369 100.0% $1,646,186 100.0%Revenue We generate revenue primarily from sales of our products. We also derive a portion of our revenue from sales of PCS, which is typically purchased in conjunction with our products, and subsequent renewals of those contracts. We expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing and size of orders, the delivery and acceptance of products, and the impact of significant transactions. In addition, while we expect our revenue to continue to grow in absolute dollars on a year-over-year basis, our revenue growth rates are expected to decline as our business scales.Product revenue increased $408.3 million, or 28.5%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily driven by sales to our existing customers as they continued to expand and upgrade their cloud networks. In addition, our newer switch products have continued to gain market acceptance, which has contributed to our revenue growth. Service revenue increased $96.9 million, or 45.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base has continued to expand. We continue to experience pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition, but demand for our products and growth in our installed base has more than offset this pricing pressure during the period. Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our third-party contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors, overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department, and other manufacturing-related costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory.Cost of revenue increased $193.6 million or 33.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to the corresponding increases in product revenues. We expect our cost of product revenue to continue to increase as our product revenue increases. Cost of providing PCS and other services consists primarily of personnel costs for our global customer support organization.Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing, manufacturing-related costs including costs associated with supply chain sourcing activities, merchant silicon costs, the mix of products sold, and excess/obsolete inventory write-downs, including charges for excess/obsolete component inventory held by our contract manufacturers. Gross margin decreased from 64.5% to 63.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by a decrease in product margins due to customer mix, partially offset by reduced inventory-related charges and an improved service margins due to a relatively fixed services cost base and growing service revenues. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time, depending on the factors described above. Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages) Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and legal settlement expense. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation and travel expenses. We 57Table of Contentsexpect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business.

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, prototype expenses, third-party engineering and contractor support costs, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs including depreciation. Our research and development efforts are focused on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development, including new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and applications. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest heavily in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features and build upon our technology leadership.Research and development expenses increased $92.9 million, or 26.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $48.9 million increase in personnel costs, including corporate bonuses and stock-based compensation, driven primarily by headcount growth from our normal hiring process and from the two acquisitions we completed in the third quarter of 2018, and a $24.7 million increase in new product introduction costs, driven by additional development projects. In addition, facility and IT costs increased by $9.5 million due to increased IT services, headcount growth and additional costs associated with our acquired businesses.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, marketing and promotional activities, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs including depreciation. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide.Sales and marketing expenses increased $32.0 million, or 20.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase primarily included a $28.0 million increase in personnel costs, which was driven by increased headcount as well as higher sales volumes, resulting in increased compensation costs, including commissions and stock-based compensation. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of Cisco and OptumSoft litigation related expenses, personnel costs, professional services fees, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs including depreciation. General and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive, finance, human resources and legal functions. Our professional services fees are primarily due to external legal, accounting, and tax services. General and administrative expenses decreased $21.4 million, or 24.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease included a $33.8 million decrease that was primarily related to a reduced level of litigation activities and a decrease in bond costs as a result of the settlement of the Cisco litigation in August 2018. The decrease was partially offset by $3.5 million of acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2018, 58Table of Contentsa $3.3 million increase in personnel costs, including increased stock-based compensation, driven by increased headcount, and a $3.1 million increase in other legal and professional fees.Legal settlement. During the three months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded $405.0 million in legal settlement expenses in connection with the Term Sheet that was entered into on August 6, 2018 between the Company and Cisco, which included a $400.0 million payment to Cisco pursuant to the Term Sheet and $5.0 million of legal fees associated with the settlement. See Note 14. Legal Settlement of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.Other Income (Expense), Net (in thousands, except percentages)Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, foreign currency transaction gains and losses, gains and losses on our investments in privately-held companies, and interest expense on our lease financing obligation. In connection with our adoption of ASU 2016-01 in 2018, other income (expense) may fluctuate in the future as a result of the re-measurement of our private company equity investments upon the occurrence of observable price changes and/or impairments. See Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details of this new guidance. In addition, Other income (expense), net will also fluctuate due to changes in interest rates, returns on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our foreign currency transactions.

See Note 5. Investments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to U.S. income tax. Generally, our U.S. tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these foreign earnings which avoids double taxation. Our tax expense to date consists of federal, state and foreign current and deferred income taxes. Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Change in $ % ofRevenue $ % ofRevenue $ %Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $(39,314) (1.9)% $51,559 3.1% $(90,873) (176.3)Effective tax rate (13.6)% 10.9% 59Table of ContentsFor the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we recorded a benefit of $39.3 million and an expense of $51.6 million for income taxes, respectively. The change in our income taxes was largely attributable to a $96.9 million tax benefit on the Cisco settlement in 2018 whereas we recorded a $51.8 million tax expense in 2017 related to the enactment of the Tax Act. The Tax Act provided for a decrease in the 2018 U.S. federal statutory tax rate, but this was partially offset by a new requirement to provide U.S. tax on foreign earnings. For further information regarding income taxes and the impact on our results of operations and financial position, see Note 10. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our future effective tax rate is expected to be impacted by fluctuations in excess tax benefits on share-based compensation.Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change in $ % ofRevenue $ % ofRevenue $ %Revenue Product $1,432,810 87.0% $991,337 87.8% $441,473 44.5%Service 213,376 13.0 137,830 12.2 75,546 54.8Total revenue 1,646,186 100.0 1,129,167 100.0 517,019 45.8Cost of revenue Product 538,035 32.7 369,768 32.8 168,267 45.5Service 46,382 2.8 36,283 3.2 10,099 27.8Total cost of revenue 584,417 35.5 406,051 36.0 178,366 43.9Gross profit $1,061,769 64.5% $723,116 64.0% $338,653 46.8%Gross margin 64.5% 64.0% Revenue by Geography (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2017 % of Total 2016 % of TotalAmericas $1,192,289 72.4 % $874,740 77.5 %Europe, Middle East and Africa 299,547 18.2 168,789 14.9Asia-Pacific 154,350 9.4 85,638 7.6Total revenue $1,646,186 100.0% $1,129,167 100.0%Revenue Product revenue increased $441.5 million, or 44.5%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily driven by increased product shipments to our existing customers as they continued to expand their cloud networks. In addition, our newer switch products had continued to gain market acceptance, which had contributed to our revenue growth. Service revenue increased $75.5 million, or 54.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand.We continued to experience pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition, but demand for our products and growth in our installed base had more than offset this pricing pressure. Deferred product revenue at December 31, 2017 remained consistent with the balance at December 31, 2016. The deferred product revenue balance at December 31, 2016 primarily included customer arrangements with new product and new customer acceptance clauses, which expired during 2017, while the balance at December 31, 2017 primarily 60Table of Contentsrepresented arrangements with a few of our larger customers related to the then ongoing qualification activities of our 945 Investigation-related product redesigns. See Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of revenue increased $178.4 million, or 43.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to an increase in product shipment volumes and the corresponding increase in product revenue. Gross margin increased from 64.0% to 64.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by improved service margins as we scaled our services business on a relatively fixed cost base and slightly better product margins due to end customer mix. This improvement was partially offset by an increase in excess and obsolete inventory-related charges as we transitioned to new products.Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change in $ % ofRevenue $ % ofRevenue $ %Operating expenses: Research and development $349,594 21.2% $273,581 24.2% $76,013 27.8%Sales and marketing 155,105 9.4 130,887 11.6 24,218 18.5General and administrative 86,798 5.3 75,239 6.7 11,559 15.4Total operating expenses $591,497 35.9% $479,707 42.5% $111,790 23.3%Research and development Research and development expenses increased $76.0 million, or 27.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $36.9 million increase in personnel costs driven by headcount growth, resulting in additional compensation costs, including stock-based compensation, and a $31.6 million increase in new product introduction costs, driven by additional development projects, and costs associated with litigation-related changes in product design. In addition, facility and IT costs increased by $5.3 million due to the headcount growth.Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased $24.2 million, or 18.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The increase included a $15.4 million increase in personnel costs, which was primarily due to increased headcount as well as higher sales volumes, driving increased compensation costs, including commissions and stock-based compensation. In addition, sales support costs increased by $8.1 million compared to 2016, reflecting increased professional services and field demonstration costs to support our sales infrastructure and expand our customer base.General and administrativeGeneral and administrative expenses increased $11.6 million, or 15.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $4.5 million increase in the Cisco litigation related expenses, which included bond costs associated with the importation and sale of affected products and components during the presidential review period of the 945 Investigation. In addition, personnel costs increased by $3.9 million primarily due to increased stock-based compensation and higher salary related costs driven by the increased headcount.61Table of ContentsOther Income (Expense), Net (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change in $ % ofRevenue $ % ofRevenue $ %Other income (expense), net: Interest expense $(2,780) (0.2)% $(3,136) (0.3)% $356 (11.4)%Other income (expense), net 7,268 0.4 1,952 0.2 5,316 272.3Total other income (expense), net $4,488 0.2 % $(1,184) (0.1)% $5,672 (479.1)%Other income (expense), net improved during the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 primarily due to an increase in interest income as we continued to generate cash and expand our marketable securities portfolio.Provision for Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Change in $ % ofRevenue $ % ofRevenue $ %Provision for income taxes $51,559 3.1% $58,036 5.1% $(6,477) (11.2)%Effective tax rate 10.9% 24.0% Our provision for income taxes was approximately $51.6 million and $58.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate from 24.0% in 2016 to 10.9% in 2017. The reduction in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of $110.0 million of excess tax benefits on share-based awards in the provision for income taxes as a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-09 in 2017, combined with a favorable geographical mix of our earnings towards jurisdictions with lower tax rates than the U.S. These positive drivers were partially offset by the inclusion of provisional tax amount totaling $51.8 million resulting from the recently enacted the Tax Act.The Tax Act makes significant changes to the U.S. tax code, which include, but are not limited to, a U.S. federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and a shift to a modified territorial tax regime, which requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of the cumulative earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had not yet completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. As a result, we recorded a provisional tax amount of $18.8 million for the transition tax and a provisional tax amount of $33.0 million related to the re-measurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities, based on the tax rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future.Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2018, our total balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $2.0 billion, of which approximately $294.1 million was held outside the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly-rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We believe that our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, 62Table of Contentsour costs associated with supply chain activities, including access to outsourced manufacturing, our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies, the continued market acceptance of our products, and costs incurred related to outstanding litigation claims. If we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017As Adjusted (1) 2016As Adjusted (1) (in thousands)Cash provided by operating activities $503,119 $631,627 $174,295Cash used in investing activities (1) (755,113) (391,320) (325,775)Cash provided by financing activities 42,851 51,469 32,745Effect of exchange rate changes (1,390) 753 (464)Net increase/(decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $(210,533) $292,529 $(119,199)__________________________ (1) Cash used in investing activities for year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were adjusted as a result of our adoption of ASU 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash, in the first quarter of 2018. See Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesOur primary source of cash provided by operating activities has been cash collections from our customers. We expect cash inflows from operating activities to be affected by increased sales and timing of collections. Our primary uses of cash from operating activities have been for personnel costs, inventory purchases from our contract manufacturers and suppliers, investment in research and development, and litigation expenses. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $503.1 million, net of $405.0 million payments for the legal settlement with Cisco including the associated legal fees. Our cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net income of $328.1 million, non-cash adjustments to net income of $71.4 million, and a net increase of $103.6 million in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Our operating cash benefited $70.5 million from increased deferred revenue reflecting ongoing growth in service and support contracts, $51.1 million from decreased inventories driven by improved inventory management and timing of receipts, $39.3 million from increased accounts payable due to timing of vendor payments primarily related to inventory-related purchases, $21.4 million from a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily due to decreased deposits at our contract manufacturers, and $17.5 million from an increase in other long term liabilities primarily driven by increased customer prepayments under cancellable contracts. These favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable changes of $77.9 million from increased accounts receivable due to increased billing and timing of customer shipments, and $14.8 million from decreased accrued liabilities due primarily to a decline in supplier liabilities and the timing of vendor accruals. During the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $631.6 million, primarily from net income of $423.2 million with non-cash adjustments to net income of $105.9 million, and a net increase of $102.5 million in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Our operating cash benefited $142.3 million from increased deferred revenue reflecting ongoing growth in service and support contracts, $43.5 million from increased accrued liabilities driven by increased inventory purchases and product development activities, and $19.9 million from increased income taxes payable. These favorable changes were partially offset by a growth in inventory of $69.7 million, supporting overall growth in the business and the expansion of our manufacturing and supply chain activities, by a decline in accounts payable of $30.1 million due 63Table of Contentsto timing of vendor payments primarily related to inventory purchases, and by an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of $11.6 million primarily due to increased prepaid taxes. During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by operating activities was $174.3 million, primarily from net income of $184.2 million with non-cash adjustments to net income of $58.6 million, partially offset by a net decrease in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities of $68.4 million. The decrease in cash from changes in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to an increase in working capital requirements with accounts receivable up $108.9 million, inventories and inventory deposits up $207.5 million, and increased prepaid expenses and current assets (excluding inventory deposits) of $54.8 million which was primarily driven by an increase in deferred cost of inventory associated with increased product revenue deferrals referenced below. These increases reflect substantial growth in the business and the expansion of our manufacturing and supply chain activities at our new contract manufacturer. These working capital increases were partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $176.1 million reflecting ongoing growth in service and support contracts and a significant increase in product deferred revenue related to contract acceptance terms, as well as an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $69.3 million primarily due to timing of inventory purchases, and an increase in income taxes payable of $42.7 million.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of available for sale marketable securities, net of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, business acquisitions, investments in privately-held companies, and capital expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in investing activities was $755.1 million, consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $1.2 billion, offset by proceeds of $547.8 million from maturities of marketable securities, $96.8 million for business acquisitions, additional investments in privately-held companies of $8.0 million, and purchases of property, equipment and other assets of $23.8 million.During the year ended December 31, 2017, cash used in investing activities was $391.3 million, consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $585.4 million, purchases of property, equipment and other assets of $15.3 million, partially offset by proceeds of $206.3 million from maturities of marketable securities and proceeds of $3.0 million from repayment of notes receivable.During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash used in investing activities was $325.8 million, consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $439.7 million, purchases of property, equipment and other assets of $21.4 million, and an additional investment in a privately-held company of $2.5 million. These decreases were partially offset by proceeds from the maturity of available-for-sale securities of $137.9 million.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesOur financing activities have consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under employee equity incentive plans, offset by principal payments for lease financing obligations related to our headquarters facility.During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by financing activities was $42.9 million, consisting primarily of proceeds of $53.7 million from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by $8.9 million of minimum tax withheld for employees and payments of $1.9 million for lease financing obligations.During the year ended December 31, 2017, cash provided by financing activities was $51.5 million, consisting primarily of proceeds of $44.6 million from employee stock option exercises, partially offset by $4.0 million of minimum tax withheld for employees, and proceeds of $12.5 million from employee stock purchases under our ESPP, partially offset by payments of $1.6 million for lease financing obligations.During the year ended December 31, 2016, cash provided by financing activities was $32.7 million, consisting primarily of proceeds from the exercise of stock options of $24.9 million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock from our ESPP of $10.3 million, partially offset by payments of $1.3 million for lease financing obligations.64Table of ContentsOff-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2018, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsOur contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. Our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future payment obligations. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing balances of cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities. The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2018 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than5 YearsFinancing lease obligation (1) $31,649 $6,321 $13,192 $12,136 $—Operating lease obligations 103,351 12,789 28,077 26,616 35,869Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 345,968 345,968 — — —Other non-cancellable purchase obligations 43,254 43,254 — — Total $524,222 $408,332 $41,269 $38,752 $35,869___________________ (1) Includes interest and land lease.The contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of $40.3 million related to uncertain tax positions and transition tax due under the Tax Act because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are the following:Revenue Recognition Prior to 2018, our revenue recognition policy was based on ASC 605 - Revenue Recognition (“ASC 605”), and is described in the section entitled Critical Accounting Policies under Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017, filed with the SEC on February 20, 2018. 65Table of ContentsEffective January 1, 2018, we adopted the new revenue recognition guidance under ASC 606 as discussed in the section titled Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements in Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following is our new revenue recognition policy effective January 1, 2018.We generate revenue from sales of our products, which incorporate our EOS software and accessories such as cables and optics, to direct customers and channel partners together with PCS. We typically sell products and PCS in a single contract. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services. We apply the following five-step revenue recognition model:•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract•Determination of the transaction price•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract•Recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligationPost-Contract Customer Support PCS, which includes technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty, bug fixes, patches and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis, is offered under renewable, fee-based contracts. We initially defer PCS revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the PCS contract as there is no discernable pattern of delivery related to these promises. We do not provide unspecified upgrades on a set schedule and addresses customer requests for technical support if and when they arise, with the related expenses recognized as incurred. PCS contracts generally have a term of one to three years. We include billed but unearned PCS revenue in deferred revenue. Contracts with Multiple Performance ObligationsMost of our contracts with customers, other than renewals of PCS, contain multiple performance obligations with a combination of products and PCS. Products and PCS generally qualify as distinct performance obligations. Our hardware includes EOS software, which together deliver the essential functionality of our products. For contracts which contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price (“SSP”). Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for products and PCS sold together in a contract to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and PCS.If we do not have an observable SSP, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, then SSP is estimated using judgment and considering all reasonably available information such as market conditions and information about the size and/or purchase volume of the customer. We generally use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for individual products and services based on multiple factors including, but not limited to the sales channel (reseller, distributor or end customer), the geographies in which our products and services are sold, and the size of the end customer.We limit the amount of revenue recognition for contracts containing forms of variable consideration, such as future performance obligations, customer-specific returns, and acceptance or refund obligations. We include some or all of an estimate of the related at risk consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recorded under each contract will not occur when the uncertainties surrounding the variable consideration are resolved. Most of our contracts with customers have payment terms of 30 days with some large high volume customers having terms of up to 60 days. We have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component because the Company and the customer have specific business reasons other than financing for entering into such contracts. Specifically, both we and our customers seek to ensure the customer has a simplified way of purchasing Arista products and services.66Table of ContentsWe account for multiple contracts with a single partner as one arrangement if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.We may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is generally no contractual provision for such returns. We estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against current-period shipments. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate.Our policy applies to the accounting for individual contracts. However, we have elected a practical expedient to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar characteristics so long as such application would not differ materially from applying the guidance to the individual contracts (or performance obligations) within that portfolio. Consequently, we have chosen to apply the portfolio approach when possible, which we do not believe will happen frequently. Additionally, we will evaluate a portfolio of data, when possible, in various situations, including accounting for commissions, rights of return and transactions with variable consideration.We report revenue net of sales taxes. We include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue.Inventory Valuation and Contract Manufacturer/Supplier LiabilitiesInventories primarily consist of finished goods and strategic components, primarily integrated circuits. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed using the first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory. We record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand, or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value.Our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts. We record a liability and a corresponding charge for non-cancellable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers or suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes. We use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures. These estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers, product development plans and current sales levels. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities.Income Taxes Income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes.We account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements, but have not been reflected in our taxable income. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. 67Table of ContentsWe believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.We regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized. We recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and to the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense.Loss ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are a party to claims and legal proceedings including matters relating to commercial, employee relations, business practices and intellectual property. In assessing loss contingencies, we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss, impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We will record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRefer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and investments in privately held companies. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, our revenue is not directly subject to foreign currency risk. However, we are indirectly exposed to foreign currency risk. A stronger U.S. dollar could make our products and services more expensive in foreign countries and therefore reduce demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. Such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are also influenced by many other factors.Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe and Asia. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to our business would have had a maximum impact of approximately $8.2 million, $6.1 million and $3.8 million on our operating results. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date and do not 68Table of Contentsenter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes, we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Interest Rate SensitivityAs of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities totaling $2.0 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in money market funds, corporate bonds, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. treasury securities and commercial paper. Our primary investment objectives are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements. In addition, our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the U.S. A decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in overall interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest income. On the other hand, the fair market value of our investments in fixed income securities may be adversely impacted. We would incur unrealized losses on fixed income securities primarily due to higher interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. Under certain circumstances, if we are forced to sell our marketable securities prior to maturity, we may incur realized losses in such investments. However, because of the conservative and short-term nature of the investments in our portfolio, a change in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Investments in Privately-Held CompaniesOur non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded in “Investments” in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately-held companies was $30.3 million and $36.1 million. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded a net loss of $13.8 million on certain investments. Prior to 2018, we did not record any impairment losses for these investments. See Note 5. Investments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details. The privately-held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately-held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.69Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:22:13.925460
1596532,ANET,"Arista Networks, Inc.",2020,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Overview Arista Networks pioneered software-driven, cognitive cloud networking for large-scale data center and campus environments. Our cloud networking solutions consist of our EOS, a set of network applications and our Ethernet switching and routing platforms. Our cloud networking solutions deliver industry-leading performance, scalability, availability, programmability, automation and visibility. At the core of our cloud networking platform is EOS, which was purpose-built to be fully programmable, highly modular and reliable. The programmability of EOS has allowed us to create a set of software applications that address the requirements of cloud networking, including workflow automation, network visibility and analytics, and has also allowed us to rapidly integrate with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services. We believe that cloud networking will continue to replace legacy network technologies across data center and campus environments. Our cloud networking platforms are well positioned to address the growing cloud networking market, and to address increasing performance requirements driven by the growing number of connected devices, as well as the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications.We generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching and routing products which incorporate our EOS software. We generate the majority of our services revenue from post contract support, or PCS, which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products. Our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies, service providers, financial services organizations, government agencies, media and entertainment companies and others. As we have grown the functionality of our EOS software, expanded the range of our product portfolio and increased the size of our sales force, our revenue has grown rapidly. We have also been profitable and operating cash flow positive for each year since 2010.We believe our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to develop market leading products and features that address the needs of our end customers and our ability to sell these products to new and existing customers, including an increase in sales in the enterprise data center switching, campus and WiFi networking markets. We intend to continue expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies, as well as our relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners in order to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers, and provide services and support. In addition, we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking 54Table of Contentsplatform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our rapid development of new features and applications.Our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our EOS software and enhancements to EOS. We engineer our products to be agnostic to the underlying merchant silicon architecture. Today, we combine our EOS software with merchant silicon into a family of switching and routing products. This enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions. We work closely with third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. Our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third party direct fulfillment facilities. We and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers.Historically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from these large end customers primarily due to changes in demand patterns specific to these customers, the time it takes these end customers to evaluate, test, qualify and accept our products, and the overall complexity of these large orders. We expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. For example, our sales to Microsoft and Facebook as end users in fiscal 2019 represented 23% and 17% of our revenue, respectively, and benefited from certain factors that are not expected to repeat in fiscal 2020. Consequently, the percentage of our revenue from Microsoft and Facebook in fiscal 2020 is expected to decline, which will likely negatively impact our revenue growth. In addition, we have provided, and may in the future provide, pricing discounts to large end customers, which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur.Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2019 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2018 Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change in $ % ofRevenue $ % ofRevenue $ %Revenue Product $2,021,150 83.8% $1,841,100 85.6% $180,050 9.8%Service 389,556 16.2 310,269 14.4 79,287 25.6Total revenue 2,410,706 100.0 2,151,369 100.0 259,337 12.1Cost of revenue Product 792,382 32.9 720,584 33.5 71,798 10.0Service 73,986 3.0 57,408 2.7 16,578 28.9Total cost of revenue 866,368 35.9 777,992 36.2 88,376 11.4Gross profit $1,544,338 64.1% $1,373,377 63.8% $170,961 12.4%Gross margin 64.1% 63.8% 55Table of ContentsRevenue by Geography (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2019 % of Total 2018 % of TotalAmericas $1,833,163 76.1 % $1,550,453 72.1 %Europe, Middle East and Africa 381,651 15.8 414,069 19.2Asia-Pacific 195,892 8.1 186,847 8.7Total revenue $2,410,706 100.0% $2,151,369 100.0%Revenue We generate revenue primarily from sales of our products. We also derive a portion of our revenue from sales of PCS, which is typically purchased in conjunction with our products, and subsequent renewals of those contracts. We expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing, size, and complexity of orders, especially with respect to our large end customers. Product revenue increased $180.1 million, or 9.8%, in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily driven by increased demand from both new and existing customers, and the recognition of product deferred revenue related to sales in the prior year for which revenue was recognized in 2019. Service revenue increased $79.3 million, or 25.6% in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base has continued to expand. International revenues represented 23.9% of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 27.9% in 2018, which was primarily due to a move toward U.S. deployments by certain of our large end customers during 2019. We continue to experience pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition, but demand for our products and growth in our installed base has more than offset this pricing pressure during the year. However, we have experienced reduced and volatile demand from certain of our large end customers during 2019, and expect this could continue in future periods, which could impact our future revenue growth. Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our third-party contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors, overhead costs in our manufacturing operations department, and other manufacturing-related costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory. Cost of providing PCS and other services primarily consists of personnel costs for our global customer support organization.Cost of revenue increased $88.4 million or 11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to the corresponding increases in product and service revenues. Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing, manufacturing-related costs including costs associated with supply chain sourcing activities, merchant silicon costs, the mix of products sold, and excess/obsolete inventory write-downs, including charges for excess/obsolete component inventory held by our contract manufacturers. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time, depending on the factors described above. Gross margin increased to 64.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 63.8% in 2018. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by an increase in product margins due to favorable customer mix, with lower discounts on smaller volume transactions, partially offset by increased product transition costs, including excess and obsolete inventory-related charges.Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages) Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, general and administrative expenses, and legal settlement expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation and travel expenses. We 56Table of Contentsexpect operating expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars in the near term as we continue to invest in the growth of our business.

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, prototype expenses, third-party engineering and contractor support costs, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs, including depreciation. Our research and development efforts are focused on maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products and on new product development, including new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and applications. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership.Research and development expenses increased $20.3 million, or 4.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $17.2 million increase in personnel costs driven primarily by headcount growth, and a $7.8 million increase in in development-related facilities costs due to facilities expansion and headcount growth, partially offset by a $5.9 million decrease in new product introduction costs, including third-party engineering and other product development costs.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, marketing, trade shows, and other promotional activities, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs, including depreciation. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide.Sales and marketing expenses increased $26.8 million, or 14.3% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The increase primarily included a $23.4 million increase in personnel costs, which was driven by increased headcount as well as higher sales volumes, resulting in increased compensation costs, including commissions and stock-based compensation. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and professional services fees, including Cisco and OptumSoft litigation-related expenses. General and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive, finance, human resources and legal functions. Our professional services fees are primarily related to external legal, accounting, and tax services. General and administrative expenses decreased $3.5 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily related to a reduced level of litigation activities as a result of the settlement of our litigation with Cisco in August 2018. 57Table of ContentsLegal settlement. During the three months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded $405.0 million in legal settlement expenses in connection with the Term Sheet that was entered into on August 6, 2018 between the Company and Cisco, which included a $400.0 million payment and $5.0 million of legal fees associated with the settlement. Pursuant to the Term Sheet, the Company and Cisco obtained dismissals of all then ongoing district court and USITC litigation between us. On December 3, 2018, the parties entered into a mutual release and settlement agreement, which superseded the Term Sheet but did not substantially alter the terms. Other Income (Expense), Net (in thousands, except percentages)Other income (expense) consists primarily of interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, gains and losses on our investments in privately-held companies, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. Upon adoption of Accounting Standard Codification Topic 842 - Leases (“ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019, we derecognized the finance lease obligation associated with our build-to-suit lease, and therefore will not incur further interest expense as it relates to this obligation. See Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. We expect other income (expense), net may fluctuate in the future as a result of the re-measurement of our private company equity investments upon the occurrence of observable price change and/or impairments, changes in interest rates or returns on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

See Note 5. Investments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to U.S. income tax. Generally, our U.S. tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these foreign earnings which avoids double taxation. Our tax expense to date consists of federal, state and foreign current and deferred income taxes.58Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Change in $ % ofRevenue $ % ofRevenue $ %Provision for (benefit from) income taxes $2,403 0.1% $(39,314) (1.9)% $41,717 (106.1)Effective tax rate 0.3% (13.6)% For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded an expense of $2.4 million and a benefit of $39.3 million for income taxes, respectively. The change in our income taxes was largely attributable to a $96.9 million tax benefit on the Cisco settlement in 2018 and an overall increase in worldwide earnings in 2019, partially offset by a net tax benefit of $86 million resulting from an intra-entity transaction to sell our non-Americas economic and beneficial intellectual property rights.

The increase was primarily driven by sales to our existing customers as they continued to expand and upgrade their cloud networks. In addition, our newer switch products have continued to gain market acceptance, which has contributed to our revenue growth. Service revenue increased $96.9 million, or 45.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base has continued to expand. We continue to experience pricing pressure on our products 59Table of Contentsand services due to competition, but demand for our products and growth in our installed base has more than offset this pricing pressure during the period. Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of revenue increased $193.6 million or 33.1% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to the corresponding increases in product revenues. Gross margin decreased from 64.5% to 63.8% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease in gross margin was primarily driven by a decrease in product margins due to customer mix, partially offset by reduced inventory-related charges and an improved service margins due to a relatively fixed services cost base and growing service revenues. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time, depending on the factors described above.Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Change in $ % ofRevenue $ % ofRevenue $ %Operating expenses: Research and development $442,468 20.6% $349,594 21.2% $92,874 26.6 %Sales and marketing 187,142 8.7 155,105 9.4 32,037 20.7General and administrative 65,420 3.0 86,798 5.3 (21,378) (24.6)Legal settlement 405,000 18.8 — — 405,000 *Total operating expenses $1,100,030 51.1% $591,497 35.9% $508,533 86.0 %Research and development Research and development expenses increased $92.9 million, or 26.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase was primarily due to a $48.9 million increase in personnel costs, including corporate bonuses and stock-based compensation, driven primarily by headcount growth from our normal hiring process and from the two acquisitions we completed in the third quarter of 2018, and a $24.7 million increase in new product introduction costs, driven by additional development projects. In addition, facility and IT costs increased by $9.5 million due to increased IT services, headcount growth and additional costs associated with our acquired businesses.Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased $32.0 million, or 20.7% for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The increase primarily included a $28.0 million increase in personnel costs, which was driven by increased headcount as well as higher sales volumes, resulting in increased compensation costs, including commissions and stock-based compensation.General and administrativeGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $21.4 million, or 24.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease included a $33.8 million decrease that was primarily related to a reduced level of litigation activities and a decrease in bond costs as a result of the settlement of the Cisco litigation in August 2018. The decrease was partially offset by $3.5 million of acquisition-related expenses incurred in 2018, a $3.3 million increase in personnel costs, including increased stock-based compensation, driven by increased headcount, and a $3.1 million increase in other legal and professional fees.Legal settlement During the three months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded $405.0 million in legal settlement expenses in connection with the Term Sheet that was entered into on August 6, 2018 between the Company and Cisco, which included a $400.0 million payment and $5.0 million of legal fees associated with the settlement. Pursuant to the 60Table of ContentsTerm Sheet, the Company and Cisco obtained dismissals of all then ongoing district court and USITC litigation between us. On December 3, 2018, the parties entered into a mutual release and settlement agreement, which superseded the Term Sheet but did not substantially alter the terms.

The change in our income taxes was largely attributable to a $96.9 million tax benefit on the Cisco settlement in 2018 whereas we recorded a $51.8 million tax expense in 2017 related to the enactment of the Tax Act. The Tax Act provided for a decrease in the 2018 U.S. federal statutory tax rate, but this was partially offset by a new requirement to provide U.S. tax on foreign earnings. For further information regarding income taxes and the impact on our results of operations and financial position, see Note 10. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2019, our total balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $2.7 billion, of which approximately $472.5 million was held outside the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for working capital purposes. Our marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly-rated securities with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We believe that our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing 61Table of Contentsadditional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, our costs associated with supply chain activities, including access to outsourced manufacturing, our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies, the continued market acceptance of our products, and stock repurchases. If we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.

See Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesOur operating activities have consisted of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, and changes in assets and liabilities.During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $963.0 million, primarily from net income of $859.9 million and net non-cash adjustments to net income of $62.4 million, partially offset by a net decrease of $40.8 million in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Cash outflows from operating activities consisted of an $11.9 million decrease in deferred revenue primarily due to the recognition of product deferred revenue related to contract acceptance terms, largely offset by increased service deferred revenue related to growth in customer service and support contracts, a $60.2 million increase in accounts receivable due to timing of shipments, and an $8.1 million increase in other assets resulting from increased spares inventory to support our customer base. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash inflows of $54.3 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets from a decrease in deferred cost of inventory due to the recognition of product deferred revenue, $23.5 million from an increase in income taxes payable, $20.9 million decrease in inventories due to timing of product shipments and receipts, and $16.4 million from increased accrued liabilities primarily due to an increase in supplier liability reserves for excess and obsolete component inventory.During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by operating activities was $503.1 million, net of $405.0 million payments for the legal settlement with Cisco including the associated legal fees. Our cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net income of $328.1 million, non-cash adjustments to net income of $71.4 million, and a net increase of $103.6 million in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Our operating cash benefited $70.5 million from increased deferred revenue reflecting ongoing growth in service and support contracts, $51.1 million from decreased inventories driven by improved inventory management and timing of receipts, $39.3 million from increased accounts payable due to timing of vendor payments primarily related to inventory-related purchases, $21.4 million from a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets primarily 62Table of Contentsdue to decreased deposits at our contract manufacturers, and $17.5 million from an increase in other long term liabilities primarily driven by increased customer prepayments under cancellable contracts. These favorable changes were partially offset by unfavorable changes of $77.9 million from increased accounts receivable due to increased billing and timing of customer shipments, and $14.8 million from decreased accrued liabilities due primarily to a decline in supplier liabilities and the timing of vendor accruals.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities have consisted primarily of purchases of available for sale marketable securities, net of proceeds from maturities of marketable securities, business acquisitions, investments in privately-held companies, and capital expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $284.1 million, primarily consisting of purchases of available-for-sale securities of $1.5 billion, and purchases of property and equipment of 15.8 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1.2 billion from maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from the sale of one of our investments in privately-held companies of $28.2 million.During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash used in investing activities was $755.1 million, consisting of purchases of marketable securities of $1.2 billion, offset by proceeds of $547.8 million from maturities of marketable securities, $96.8 million for business acquisitions, additional investments in privately-held companies of $8.0 million, and purchases of property, equipment and other assets of $23.8 million.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesOur financing activities have consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under employee equity incentive plans, offset by repurchases of our common stock.During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by financing activities was $218.0 million, consisting primarily of payments for repurchases of our common stock of $266.1 million and taxes paid of $9.2 million upon vesting of restricted stock units, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans of $57.4 million.During the year ended December 31, 2018, cash provided by financing activities was $42.9 million, consisting primarily of proceeds of $53.7 million from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans, partially offset by $8.9 million of taxes paid upon vesting of restricted stock units, and payments of $1.9 million for lease financing obligations.Stock Repurchase ProgramFrom time to time, we repurchase our common stock opportunistically pursuant to our Repurchase Program authorized by our board of directors in April 2019. The Repurchase Program allows for stock repurchases of up to $1.0 billion and these repurchases are funded from working capital. The Repurchase Program, which expires in April 2022, does not obligate us to acquire any of our common stock, and may be suspended or discontinued by us at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2019, we repurchased a total of $266.1 million of our common stock, and the remaining authorized amount for repurchases under the Repurchase Program was $733.9 million. Refer to Note 8. Equity Award Plan Activities of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2019, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.63Table of ContentsContractual Obligations and CommitmentsOur contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. Our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future payment obligations. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing balances of cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities. The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2019 (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Total Less than1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than5 YearsOperating lease obligations 117,065 20,563 42,794 27,488 26,220Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers 279,203 279,203 — — —Other non-cancellable purchase obligations 15,482 15,482 — — Transition tax payable 5,967 — — 2,025 3,942Total $417,717 $315,248 $42,794 $29,513 $30,162The contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of $57.5 million related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments. In connection with Tax Reform, as of December 31, 2017, we recorded a federal income tax payable for transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that will be payable over an eight-year period. The amounts included in the table above represent the remaining federal income tax payable after applying the first year’s installment payment and early payments of future installments. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are the following:Revenue Recognition We generate revenue from sales of our products, which incorporate our EOS software and accessories such as cables and optics, to direct customers and channel partners together with PCS. We typically sell products and PCS in a single contract. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services. We apply the following five-step revenue recognition model:•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract•Determination of the transaction price•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract64Table of Contents•Recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligationPost-Contract Customer Support PCS, which includes technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty, bug fixes, patches and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis, is offered under renewable, fee-based contracts. We initially defer PCS revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the PCS contract as there is no discernable pattern of delivery related to these promises. We do not provide unspecified upgrades on a set schedule and addresses customer requests for technical support if and when they arise, with the related expenses recognized as incurred. PCS contracts generally have a term of one to three years. We include billed but unearned PCS revenue in deferred revenue. Contracts with Multiple Performance ObligationsMost of our contracts with customers, other than renewals of PCS, contain multiple performance obligations with a combination of products and PCS. Products and PCS generally qualify as distinct performance obligations. Our hardware includes EOS software, which together deliver the essential functionality of our products. For contracts which contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price (“SSP”). Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for products and PCS sold together in a contract to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and PCS.If we do not have an observable SSP, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, then SSP is estimated using judgment and considering all reasonably available information such as market conditions and information about the size and/or purchase volume of the customer. We generally use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for individual products and services based on multiple factors including, but not limited to the sales channel (reseller, distributor or end customer), the geographies in which our products and services are sold, and the size of the end customer.We limit the amount of revenue recognition for contracts containing forms of variable consideration, such as future performance obligations, customer-specific returns, and acceptance or refund obligations. We include some or all of an estimate of the related at risk consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recorded under each contract will not occur when the uncertainties surrounding the variable consideration are resolved. Most of our contracts with customers have payment terms of 30 days with some large high volume customers having terms of up to 60 days. We have determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component because the Company and the customer have specific business reasons other than financing for entering into such contracts. Specifically, both we and our customers seek to ensure the customer has a simplified way of purchasing Arista products and services.We account for multiple contracts with a single partner as one arrangement if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.We may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is generally no contractual provision for such returns. We estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical returns rates applied against current-period shipments. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate.Our policy applies to the accounting for individual contracts. However, we have elected a practical expedient to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar characteristics so long as such application would not differ materially from applying the guidance to the individual contracts (or performance obligations) within that portfolio. Consequently, we have chosen to apply the portfolio approach when possible, which we do not believe will happen frequently. Additionally, we will evaluate a portfolio of data, when possible, in various situations, including accounting for commissions, rights of return and transactions with variable consideration.65Table of ContentsWe report revenue net of sales taxes. We include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue.Inventory Valuation and Contract Manufacturer/Supplier LiabilitiesInventories primarily consist of finished goods and strategic components, primarily integrated circuits. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed using the first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory. We record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand, or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value.Our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts. We record a liability and a corresponding charge for non-cancellable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers or suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes. We use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures. These estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers, product development plans and current sales levels. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, which may be caused by factors within and outside of our control, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer liabilities.Income Taxes Income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes.We account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements, but have not been reflected in our taxable income. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. We believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.We regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized. We recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and to the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense.Loss ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are a party to claims and legal proceedings including matters relating to commercial, employee relations, business practices and intellectual property. In assessing loss contingencies, we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss, impairment of an asset or the 66Table of Contentsincurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We will record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be reasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRefer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and investments in privately held companies. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, our revenue is not directly subject to foreign currency risk. However, we are indirectly exposed to foreign currency risk. A stronger U.S. dollar could make our products and services more expensive in foreign countries and therefore reduce demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. Such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are also influenced by many other factors.Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe and Asia. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates on our monetary assets and liabilities would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date and do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes, we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Interest Rate SensitivityAs of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities totaling $2.7 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in money market funds, corporate bonds, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. treasury securities and commercial paper. Our primary investment objectives are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements. In addition, our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the U.S. A decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in overall interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest income. On the other hand, the fair market value of our investments in fixed income securities may be adversely impacted. We would incur unrealized losses on fixed income securities primarily due to higher interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. Under certain circumstances, if we are forced to sell our marketable 67Table of Contentssecurities prior to maturity, we may incur realized losses in such investments. However, because of the conservative and short-term nature of the investments in our portfolio, a change in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Investments in Privately-Held CompaniesOur non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded in “Investments” in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately-held companies was $4.2 million and $30.3 million. During fiscal 2019, we recorded a net gain of $5.4 million on certain investments, compared to a net loss of $13.8M during fiscal 2018. See Note 5. Investments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details. The privately-held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately-held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.68Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:22:12.050977
1596532,ANET,"Arista Networks, Inc.",2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Overview Arista Networks pioneered software-driven, cognitive cloud networking for large-scale data center and campus workspace environments. Our industry-leading cloud networking platform is highly scalable and programmable, and purpose built to address the functional and performance requirements for cloud networks, including workflow automation, network visibility and analytics, and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services. We generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching and routing platforms, which incorporate our EOS software, and related network applications. We also generate revenue from post contract support, or PCS, which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products, and renewals of PCS. We sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners. Our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies, service providers, financial services organizations, government agencies, media and entertainment companies and others. Historically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from these large end customers primarily due to changes in demand patterns specific to these customers, the time it takes these end customers to evaluate, test, qualify and accept our products, and the overall complexity of these large orders. We expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. For example, sales to our end customers Microsoft and Facebook in fiscal 2019 collectively represented 40% of our total revenue, whereas sales to our end customer Microsoft in fiscal 2020 amounted to 21.5% of our revenues, with our end customer Facebook representing less than 10% of our revenues in the period. These changes contributed to a year-over-year decline in our revenue for fiscal 2020. However, this decline in revenue from these large end customers was in part offset by stronger sales to our enterprise and other cloud and service provider customers. In addition, we typically provide pricing discounts to large end customers, which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur. We believe that cloud networking will continue to replace legacy network technologies across data center and campus environments. Our cloud networking platforms are well positioned to address the growing cloud networking market, and to address increasing performance requirements driven by the growing number of connected devices, as well as the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications.52Table of ContentsThe markets for cloud networking solutions are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, changing end-customer needs, evolving industry standards, frequent introductions of new products and services and industry consolidation. We expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to evolve and adapt to our rapidly changing environment. We must also continue to develop market leading products and features that address the needs of our existing and new customers, and increase sales in the enterprise data center switching, and campus workspace markets. We intend to continue expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies, as well as our relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners in order to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers, and provide services and support. In addition, we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our ability to rapidly develop new features and applications.Our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our EOS software and enhancements to EOS. We engineer our products to be agnostic with respect to the underlying merchant silicon architecture. Today, we combine our EOS software with merchant silicon into a family of switching and routing products. This enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions. We work closely with third party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. Our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third party direct fulfillment facilities. We and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers.Recent Developments The global coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and related shelter in place, travel and social distancing restrictions imposed by governments around the world in an effort to contain or slow its spread have negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted business, sales activities, supply chains and workforce participation, including our own, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, and we expect that the global health crisis caused by COVID-19 will continue to negatively impact business activity for the foreseeable future.We have taken numerous steps, and will continue to take further actions, in our approach to address COVID-19. We have prioritized the protection of our employees during this pandemic and, as a result, have closed our offices across the globe (including our corporate headquarters), limiting access to only those employees providing essential activities, instructed employees to work from home, and implemented travel restrictions. We continue to work closely with our contract manufacturers and supply chain partners who have experienced delays in component sourcing, workforce disruptions and governmental restrictions on the production and export of their products. Although we have worked diligently to drive improvements in these areas, including funding additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments, these delays have negatively impacted our ability to supply products to our customers on a timely basis. We expect to continue to invest in working capital as supply availability improves in order to address the risk of future COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions, but we cannot be certain that such disruptions will not occur. When the COVID-19 pandemic began, we initially experienced some volatility in customer demand, but sales activity subsequently stabilized and we experienced incremental improvements in overall demand as the year progressed. However, the supply chain disruptions outlined above and the earlier volatility in customer demand contributed in part to a year-over-year decline in total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration and spread of the pandemic, the breadth and duration of governmental containment measures such as shelter in place, travel and social distancing restrictions as well as the reauthorization of or increase in such measures in the event of spikes in COVID-19 infection rates, the success of the COVID-19 vaccination deployment, and the impact on our customers, partners, contract manufacturers 53Table of Contentsand supply chain, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. However, any continued or renewed disruption in manufacturing and supply resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or related containment measures could negatively impact our business. We also believe that any extended or renewed COVID-19 related economic disruption could have a negative impact on demand from our customers in future periods. Accordingly, current results and financial condition discussed herein may not be indicative of future operating results and trends.In response to potential future COVID-19 related disruptions to our business, we have continued to carefully review our investment and spending plans, cautiously increasing incremental spending in the second half of fiscal 2020 as overall customer demand stabilized. Although management is actively monitoring the impact of COVID-19 on the Company’s financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce, the full impact of the pandemic continues to evolve as of the date of this report. As such, the Company is unable to estimate the effects of COVID-19 on its future results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.AcquisitionsOn February 5, 2020, we acquired Big Switch Networks, Inc. (“Big Switch”), a network monitoring and software-defined networking pioneer headquartered in Santa Clara, California. With the acquisition of Big Switch, we expanded our data center networking solutions and further strengthen our network monitoring and observability suite delivered through Arista’s software platform CloudVision and DANZ (DataANalyZer) capabilities. In addition, on October 7, 2020, we completed the acquisition of Awake Security Inc. (“Awake Security”), a network detection and response (“NDR”) platform provider headquartered in Santa Clara, California. With the acquisition of Awake Security, we added an NDR platform to our product portfolio that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with human expertise to autonomously hunt for and respond to insider and external threats.Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Profit (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31,20202019Change in$% ofRevenue$% ofRevenue$%RevenueProduct$1,830,842 79.0 %$2,021,150 83.8 %$(190,308)(9.4)%Service 486,670 21.0 389,556 16.2 97,114 24.9 Total revenue2,317,512 100.0 2,410,706 100.0 (93,194)(3.9)Cost of revenueProduct749,962 32.4 792,382 32.9 (42,420)(5.4)Service 85,664 3.7 73,986 3.0 11,678 15.8 Total cost of revenue835,626 36.1 866,368 35.9 (30,742)(3.5)Gross profit$1,481,886 63.9 %$1,544,338 64.1 %$(62,452)(4.0)%Gross margin63.9 %64.1 %54Table of ContentsRevenue by Geography (in thousands, except percentages)Year Ended December 31,2020% of Total2019% of TotalAmericas$1,771,992 76.5 %$1,833,163 76.1 %Europe, Middle East and Africa 326,729 14.1 381,651 15.8 Asia-Pacific 218,791 9.4 195,892 8.1 Total revenue $2,317,512 100.0 %$2,410,706 100.0 %Revenue Product revenue primarily consists of sales of our switching and routing products, and software licenses. Service revenue is primarily derived from sales of post-contract support, or PCS, which is typically purchased in conjunction with our products, and subsequent renewals of those contracts. We expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing, size, and complexity of orders, especially with respect to our large end customers. Product revenue decreased $190.3 million, or 9.4%, in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of $125.1 million of deferred product revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019 related to customer acceptance of products shipped in prior periods. In addition, we experienced reduced sales to our larger customers during fiscal 2020, combined with the impact of some COVID-19 related supply constraints. Service revenue increased $97.1 million, or 24.9% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand. International revenues remained relatively constant at 23.5% of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 23.9% in 2019, with a slight decrease in growth in our EMEA region, mostly offset by an increase in growth in our Asia-Pacific region. International revenue generally fluctuates based on the timing of deployments by certain of our large end customers. Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of product revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our third-party contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors, overhead costs of our manufacturing operations, and other costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory. Cost of service revenue primarily consists of personnel and other costs associated with our global customer support and services organizations.Cost of revenue decreased $30.7 million or 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to a corresponding decrease in product revenues, and was partially offset by incremental COVID-19 related supply chain costs and increased product transition costs. Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition, the mix of sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing, manufacturing-related costs, including costs associated with supply chain sourcing activities, merchant silicon costs, the mix of products sold, and excess/obsolete inventory write-downs, including charges for excess/obsolete component inventory held by our contract manufacturers. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time, depending on the factors described above. Gross margin slightly decreased from 64.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 63.9% in 2020. Gross margin was negatively impacted by incremental COVID-19 related supply chain costs and some increased product transition costs, combined with the impact of fixed overhead costs on a lower revenue base. These negative impacts were partially offset by a reduction in sales to our larger end customers who generally receive larger discounts, and improved service margins as we scale our services organization.55Table of ContentsOperating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages) Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation and travel expenses.

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, prototype expenses, third-party engineering costs, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs. Our research and development efforts are focused on new product development and maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products, including new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and applications. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership.Research and development expenses increased $23.8 million, or 5.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $26.8 million increase in stock-based compensation from new and refresh grants during the current fiscal year, and a $7.8 million increase in acquisition-related expenses and amortization of acquired intangible assets from our acquisition of Big Switch and Awake Security, partially offset by an $11.4 million decrease in new product introduction costs, including third-party engineering and other product development costs.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, marketing, trade shows, and other promotional activities, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide.Sales and marketing expenses increased $15.5 million, or 7.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was driven by increased headcount, resulting in increased compensation costs, including salaries and stock-based compensation, partially offset by a decrease in travel and other sales and marketing activities due to COVID-19. General and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and professional services costs. General and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive, finance, human resources and legal functions. Our professional services costs are primarily related to external legal, accounting, and tax services. General and administrative expenses increased $4.3 million, or 7.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily driven by acquisition-related costs from our acquisitions of Big Switch and Awake Security in the current fiscal year. 56Table of ContentsOther Income, Net (in thousands, except percentages)Other income, net consists primarily of interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, gains and losses on our investments in privately-held companies, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. We expect other income, net may fluctuate in the future as a result of the re-measurement of our private company equity investments upon the occurrence of observable price changes and/or impairments, changes in interest rates or returns on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

This was partially offset by a realized gain of $9.4 million on the sale of marketable securities in the third quarter of the year ended December 31, 2020. Provision for Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to U.S. income tax. Generally, our U.S. tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these foreign earnings, which avoids double taxation. Our tax expense to date consists of federal, state and foreign current and deferred income taxes.

The change in our income taxes was largely attributable to a net tax benefit of $86 million in 2019 resulting from an intra-entity transaction to sell our non-Americas economic and beneficial intellectual property rights. Further, while we experienced a decrease in worldwide profit before tax in 2020 compared to 2019, the tax benefits attributable to stock-based compensation also decreased, along with an increase in foreign earnings taxed in non-zero rate jurisdictions, resulting in overall higher tax expense.

The increase was primarily driven by increased demand from both new and existing customers, and the recognition of product deferred revenue related to sales in the prior year for which revenue was recognized in 2019. Service revenue increased $79.3 million, or 25.6% in the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base has continued to expand. International revenues represented 23.9% of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2019, compared to 27.9% in 2018, which was primarily due to a move toward U.S. deployments by certain of our large end customers during 2019. We continue to experience pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition, but demand for our products and growth in our installed base has more than offset this pricing pressure during the year. However, we have experienced reduced and volatile demand from certain of our large end customers during 2019.Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of revenue increased $88.4 million or 11.4% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The increase in cost of revenue was primarily due to the corresponding increases in product and service revenues. Gross margin increased to 64.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 63.8% in 2018. The increase in gross margin was primarily driven by an increase in product margins due to favorable customer mix, with lower discounts on smaller volume transactions, partially offset by increased product transition costs, including excess and obsolete inventory-related charges.Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages)58Table of Contents Year Ended December 31, 20192018Change in $% ofRevenue$% ofRevenue$%Operating expenses:Research and development $462,759 19.2 %$442,468 20.6 %$20,291 4.6 %Sales and marketing 213,907 8.9 187,142 8.7 26,765 14.3 General and administrative61,898 2.6 65,420 3.0 (3,522)(5.4)Legal settlement— — 405,000 18.8 (405,000)(100.0)Total operating expenses$738,564 30.7 %$1,100,030 51.1 %$(361,466)(32.9)%Research and development Research and development expenses increased $20.3 million, or 4.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily due to a $17.2 million increase in personnel costs driven primarily by headcount growth, and a $7.8 million increase in development-related facilities costs due to facilities expansion and headcount growth, partially offset by a $5.9 million decrease in new product introduction costs, including third-party engineering and other product development costs.Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased $26.8 million, or 14.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The increase primarily included a $23.4 million increase in personnel costs, which was driven by increased headcount as well as higher sales volumes, resulting in increased compensation costs, including commissions and stock-based compensation.General and administrativeGeneral and administrative expenses decreased $3.5 million, or 5.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to 2018. The decrease was primarily related to a reduced level of litigation activity as a result of the settlement of our litigation with Cisco in August 2018.Legal settlementDuring the three months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded $405.0 million in legal settlement expenses in connection with the Term Sheet that was entered into on August 6, 2018 between the Company and Cisco, which included a $400.0 million payment and $5.0 million of legal fees associated with the settlement. Pursuant to the Term Sheet, the Company and Cisco obtained dismissals of all then ongoing district court and USITC litigation between us. On December 3, 2018, the parties entered into a mutual release and settlement agreement, which superseded the Term Sheet but did not substantially alter the terms.

Upon adoption of Accounting Standard Codification Topic 842 - Leases (“ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019, we derecognized the finance lease obligation associated with our build-to-suit lease, and therefore ceased to incur further interest expense as it relates to this obligation. Provision for (Benefit from) Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 20192018Change in $% ofRevenue$% ofRevenue$%Provision for (benefit from) income taxes$2,403 0.1 %$(39,314)(1.9)%$41,717 (106.1)%Effective tax rate0.3 %(13.6)%For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recorded an expense of $2.4 million and a benefit of $39.3 million for income taxes, respectively. The change in our income taxes was largely attributable to a $96.9 million tax benefit from the Cisco settlement in 2018 and an overall increase in worldwide earnings in 2019, partially offset by a net tax benefit of $86 million in 2019 resulting from an intra-entity transaction to sell our non-Americas economic and beneficial intellectual property rights. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2020, our total balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $2.9 billion, of which approximately $421.0 million was held outside the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general business purposes including the funding of working capital. Our marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly-rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We believe that our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, our costs associated with supply chain activities, including access to outsourced manufacturing, our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies, the continued market acceptance of our products, and stock repurchases. If we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.60Table of ContentsCash FlowsYear Ended December 31,202020192018(in thousands)Cash provided by operating activities$735,114 $963,034 $503,119 Cash (used in) investing activities (608,802)(284,072)(755,113)Cash (used in) provided by financing activities(346,339)(217,964)42,851 Effect of exchange rate changes1,966 353 (1,390)Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$(218,061)$461,351 $(210,533)Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesOur operating activities consist of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, and changes in assets and liabilities.During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $735.1 million, primarily from net income of $634.6 million and net non-cash adjustments to net income of $186.2 million, partially offset by a net increase of $85.7 million in working capital requirements. The net non-cash adjustments primarily consist of $137.0 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $44.6 million of depreciation and amortization expenses. The increase in working capital primarily consisted of a $235.3 million increase in inventory to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions, partially offset by a $50.4 million increase in deferred revenue, a $41.1 million increase in accounts payable related to the timing of production receipts, and a $17.1 million increase in other liabilities primarily due to an increase in customer contract liabilities. During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash provided by operating activities was $963.0 million, primarily from net income of $859.9 million and net non-cash adjustments to net income of $62.4 million, partially offset by a net decrease of $40.8 million in cash from changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Cash outflows from operating activities consisted of an $11.9 million decrease in deferred revenue primarily due to the recognition of product deferred revenue related to contract acceptance terms, largely offset by increased service deferred revenue related to growth in customer service and support contracts, a $60.2 million increase in accounts receivable due to timing of shipments, and an $8.1 million increase in other assets resulting from increased spares inventory to support our customer base. These cash outflows were partially offset by cash inflows of $54.3 million in prepaid expenses and other current assets from a decrease in deferred cost of inventory due to the recognition of product deferred revenue, $23.5 million from an increase in income taxes payable, $20.9 million decrease in inventories due to timing of product shipments and receipts, and $16.4 million from increased accrued liabilities primarily due to an increase in supplier liability reserves for excess and obsolete component inventory.Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities consist of our marketable securities investments, business combinations, investments in privately-held companies, and capital expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $608.8 million, primarily consisting of purchases of available-for-sale securities of $2.7 billion, $227.4 million for the acquisition of Big Switch and Awake Security, and purchases of property, equipment and intangible assets of 15.4 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1.5 billion from maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $773.0 million and proceeds from the sale of one of our investments in privately-held companies of $3.4 million.During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in investing activities was $284.1 million, primarily consisting of purchases of available-for-sale securities of $1.5 billion, and purchases of property and 61Table of Contentsequipment of 15.8 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1.2 billion from maturities of marketable securities and proceeds from the sale of one of our investments in privately-held companies of $28.2 million.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesOur financing activities consist of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under employee equity incentive plans, offset by repurchases of our common stock.During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in financing activities was $346.3 million, consisting primarily of payments for repurchases of our common stock of $395.2 million and taxes paid of $8.7 million upon vesting of restricted stock units, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans of $57.6 million.During the year ended December 31, 2019, cash used in financing activities was $218.0 million, consisting primarily of payments for repurchases of our common stock of $266.1 million and taxes paid of $9.2 million upon vesting of restricted stock units, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans of $57.4 million.Stock Repurchase ProgramWe have periodically repurchased our common stock pursuant to our Repurchase Program authorized by our board of directors in April 2019. The Repurchase Program allows for stock repurchases of up to $1.0 billion over three years and these repurchases are to be funded from operating cash flows. The Repurchase Program, which expires in April 2022, does not obligate us to acquire any of our common stock, and may be suspended or discontinued by us at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2020, the remaining authorized amount for repurchases under the Repurchase Program was $338.7 million. Refer to Note 8. Stockholders' Equity and Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsAs of December 31, 2020, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Contractual Obligations and CommitmentsOur contractual commitments will have an impact on our future liquidity. Our contractual obligations represent material expected or contractually committed future payment obligations. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing balances of cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities. The following summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2020 (in thousands): Payments Due by PeriodTotalLess than1 Year1 to 3 Years3 to 5 YearsMore than5 YearsOperating lease obligations104,258 21,770 41,423 21,139 19,926 Purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers421,857 421,857 — — — Other non-cancellable purchase obligations32,103 32,103 — — Transition tax payable6,343 — — 6,343 — Total$564,561 $475,730 $41,423 $27,482 $19,926 62Table of ContentsThe contractual obligation table above excludes tax liabilities of $46.7 million related to uncertain tax positions because we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments. In connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we recorded a federal income tax payable for transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that will be payable over an eight-year period. The amounts included in the table above represent the remaining federal income tax payable after applying the first year's installment payment and early payments of future installments.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"" or ""U.S. GAAP"") and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. The critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgments that we believe have the most significant impact on our consolidated financial statements are the following:Revenue RecognitionWe generate revenue from sales of our products, which incorporate our EOS software and accessories such as cables and optics, to direct customers and channel partners together with PCS. We typically sell products and PCS in a single contract. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services. We apply the following five-step revenue recognition model:•Identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer•Identification of the performance obligations in the contract•Determination of the transaction price•Allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract•Recognition of revenue when (or as) we satisfy the performance obligationPost-Contract Customer SupportPCS, which includes technical support, hardware repair and replacement parts beyond standard warranty, bug fixes, patches and unspecified upgrades on a when-and-if-available basis, is offered under renewable, fee-based contracts. We initially defer PCS revenue and recognize it ratably over the life of the PCS contract as there is no discernible pattern of delivery related to these promises. We do not provide unspecified upgrades on a set schedule and address customer requests for technical support if and when they arise, with the related expenses recognized as incurred. PCS contracts generally have a term of one to three years. We include billed but unearned PCS revenue in deferred revenue. Contracts with Multiple Performance ObligationsMost of our contracts with customers, other than renewals of PCS, contain multiple performance obligations with a combination of products and PCS. Products and PCS generally qualify as distinct performance obligations. Our hardware includes EOS software, which together deliver the essential functionality of our products. For contracts which contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price (“SSP”). Judgment is 63Table of Contentsrequired to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for products and PCS sold together in a contract to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and PCS.If we do not have an observable SSP, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, then SSP is estimated using judgment and considering all reasonably available information such as market conditions and information about the size and/or purchase volume of the customer. We generally use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for individual products and services based on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the sales channel (reseller, distributor or end customer), the geographies in which our products and services are sold, and the size of the end customer.We limit the amount of revenue recognition for contracts containing forms of variable consideration, such as future performance obligations, customer-specific returns, and acceptance or refund obligations. We include some or all of an estimate of the related at risk consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recorded under each contract will not occur when the uncertainties surrounding the variable consideration are resolved. Most of our contracts with customers have payment terms of 30 days, with some large high volume customers having terms of up to 60 days. We have determined that our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component because the Company and the customer have specific business reasons other than financing for entering into such contracts. Specifically, both we and our customers seek to ensure the customer has a simplified way of purchasing our products and services.We account for multiple contracts with a single partner as one arrangement if the contractual terms and/or substance of those agreements indicate that they may be so closely related that they are, in effect, parts of a single contract.We may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is generally no contractual provision for such returns. We estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical return rates applied against current-period shipments. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate.Our policy applies to the accounting for individual contracts. However, we have elected a practical expedient to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar characteristics so long as such application would not differ materially from applying the guidance to the individual contracts (or performance obligations) within that portfolio. Consequently, we have chosen to apply the portfolio approach when possible, which we do not believe will happen frequently. Additionally, we will evaluate a portfolio of data, when possible, in various situations, including accounting for commissions, rights of return and transactions with variable consideration.We report revenue net of sales taxes. We include shipping charges billed to customers in revenue and the related shipping costs are included in cost of product revenue.Inventory Valuation and Contract Manufacturer/Supplier LiabilitiesInventories primarily consist of finished goods and strategic components, primarily integrated circuits. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed using the first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory. We record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand, or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value.Our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts. We record a liability and a corresponding charge for non-cancellable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers or suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes. 64Table of ContentsWe use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures. These estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers, product development plans and current sales levels. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, which may be caused by factors within and/or outside of our control, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer/supplier liabilities.Income Taxes Income tax expense is an estimate of current income taxes payable in the current fiscal year based on reported income before income taxes. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that we recognize for financial reporting and income tax purposes.We account for income taxes under the liability approach for deferred income taxes, which requires recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements, but have not been reflected in our taxable income. Estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred income tax assets, which arise from temporary differences and carryforwards. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled. We regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred income tax assets will be realized based on the positive and negative evidence available. We record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize. We believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, although we can provide no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be materially different. To the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made and could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. The provision for income taxes includes the effects of any reserves that we believe are appropriate, as well as the related net interest and penalties.We regularly review our tax positions and benefits to be realized. We recognize tax liabilities based upon our estimate of whether, and to the extent to which, additional taxes will be due when such estimates are more likely than not to be sustained. An uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a 50% likelihood of being sustained. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense.The U.S. tax rules require U.S. tax on foreign earnings, known as global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”). Under U.S. GAAP, we are allowed to make an accounting policy choice of either (1) treating taxes due on future U.S. inclusions in taxable income related to GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred (the “period cost method”) or (2) factoring such amounts into a company’s measurement of its deferred taxes (the “deferred method”). We selected the deferred method of accounting and recorded the associated basis differences anticipated to influence prospective GILTI calculations.Loss ContingenciesIn the ordinary course of business, we are a party to claims and legal proceedings including matters relating to commercial, employee relations, business practices and intellectual property. In assessing loss contingencies, we use significant judgment and assumptions to estimate the likelihood of loss, impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability, as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss. We record a provision for contingent losses when it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We will record a charge equal to the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met: (i) information available prior to issuance of our consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (ii) the range of loss can be 65Table of Contentsreasonably estimated. We regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRefer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and investments in privately-held companies. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has increased the volatility of global financial markets, which may increase our foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. For further discussion of the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results, and financial condition, see Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, our revenue is not directly subject to foreign currency risk. However, we are indirectly exposed to foreign currency risk. A stronger U.S. dollar could make our products and services more expensive in foreign countries and therefore reduce demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. Such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are also influenced by many other factors.Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe and Asia. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates on our monetary assets and liabilities would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date and do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes, we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Interest Rate SensitivityAs of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities totaling $2.9 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in money market funds, corporate bonds, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. treasury securities and commercial paper. Our primary investment objectives are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements. In addition, our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the U.S. A decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the effect of a hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in overall interest rates would not have had a material impact on our interest income. On the other hand, the fair market value of our investments in fixed income securities may be adversely impacted. We would incur unrealized losses on fixed income securities if there is an increase in interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. Under certain circumstances, if we are forced to sell our marketable securities prior to maturity, we may incur realized losses in such investments. However, 66Table of Contentsbecause of the conservative and short-term nature of the investments in our portfolio, a change in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Investments in Privately-Held CompaniesOur non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded in “Investments” in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately-held companies was $8.3 million and $4.2 million. During fiscal 2020, we recorded a net gain of $4.1 million on certain investments, compared to a net gain of $5.4 million during fiscal 2019. See Note 5. Investments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details. The privately-held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately-held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.67Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:22:05.425518
1596532,ANET,"Arista Networks, Inc.",2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.48Table of ContentsOverview Arista Networks pioneered data-driven, cognitive cloud networking for large-scale data center and campus workspace environments. Our cloud networking solutions consist of our Extensible Operating System (""EOS""), a set of network applications and our Ethernet switching and routing platforms. We are a leader in cloud networking solutions delivering high performance, scalability, availability, programmability, workload orchestration, automation and visibility. In recent years, we have sought to bring the operational consistency and principles of cloud networking to the broader enterprise and campus markets with our Cognitive Cloud Networking, extending EOS across the enterprise data center and campus wired and wireless workspaces. We generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching and routing platforms, which incorporate our EOS software, and related network applications. We also generate revenue from post-contract support (""PCS""), which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products, and renewals of PCS. We sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners. As of December 31, 2021, we had delivered our cloud networking solutions to over 8,000 end customers worldwide. Our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies, service providers, financial services organizations, government agencies, media and entertainment companies, and others. Historically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from these large end customers primarily due to changes in demand patterns specific to these customers, the time it takes these end customers to evaluate, test, qualify and accept our products, and the overall complexity of these large orders. We expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. For example, sales to our end customers Microsoft and Meta Platforms in fiscal 2019 collectively represented 40% of our total revenue, whereas sales to our end customer Microsoft in fiscal 2020 and 2021 amounted to 21.5% and 15.0% of our revenues, respectively, with our end customer Meta Platforms representing less than 10% of our revenues in both fiscal 2020 and 2021. While we experienced some decline in overall revenue in 2020, the decline in revenue from these large end customers in 2021 was more than offset by stronger sales to our enterprise and other cloud and service provider customers. In addition, we typically provide pricing discounts to large end customers, which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur. We expect customer concentration with these large end customers to be cyclical and linked to new product introductions and customer investment cycles.We believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy network architectures. As organizations of all sizes have moved workloads to the cloud, spending on cloud and next-generation data centers has increased rapidly, while traditional legacy IT spending has grown more slowly. Our cloud networking platforms are well positioned to address the growing cloud networking market, and to address increasing performance requirements driven by the growing number of connected devices, as well as the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications.The markets for cloud networking solutions are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, changing end-customer needs, evolving industry standards, frequent introductions of new products and services, and industry consolidation. We expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to evolve and adapt to our rapidly changing environment. We must also continue to develop market-leading products and features that address the needs of our existing and new customers, and increase sales in the enterprise data center switching, and campus workspace markets. We intend to continue expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies, as well as our relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners in order to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers, and provide services and support. In addition, we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our ability to rapidly develop new features and applications.49Table of ContentsOur development model is focused on the development of new products based on our EOS software and enhancements to EOS. We engineer our products to be agnostic with respect to the underlying merchant silicon architecture. The programmability of EOS has allowed us to expand our software applications to address the ever-increasing demands of cloud networking, including workflow automation, network visibility, analytics and network detection and response, and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services. This enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions. We work closely with third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. Our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third-party direct fulfillment facilities. We and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers.COVID-19 UpdateThe global coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic continues to disrupt and have unpredictable impacts to our global society, economies, financial markets and business activities. We are actively monitoring and evaluating developments as the situation evolves and will continue to take further actions in our approach to address COVID-19. We have prioritized the protection of our employees during this pandemic and, as a result, our offices across the globe have remained closed, limiting access to facilities-based employees and a limited number of employees on a voluntary basis, and continue to impose some travel restrictions. In addition, our manufacturing and supply chain operations have experienced significant constraints, with component shortages, increased supply chain costs and delays broadly impacting the industry as a whole. We continue to work closely with our contract manufacturers and supply chain partners who have experienced delays in component sourcing, workforce disruptions and governmental restrictions on the production and export of their products. Although we have worked diligently to drive improvements in these areas, including funding additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments, these delays have negatively impacted our ability to supply products to our customers on a timely basis. We have increased our purchase commitments and expect to continue to invest in working capital to address delays in component sourcing and the risk of future COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions, but we cannot be certain that such delays or disruptions will not occur. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic, the breadth and duration of governmental containment measures such as workplace, travel and social distancing restrictions, as well as the reauthorization of or increase in such measures in the event of spikes in COVID-19 infection rates, the success of the COVID-19 vaccination deployment, and the impact on our customers, partners, employees, contract manufacturers and supply chain, all of which are uncertain and cannot be predicted. However, any continued or renewed disruption in manufacturing and supply resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic or related containment measures could negatively impact our business. We also believe that any extended or renewed COVID-19 related economic disruption could have a negative impact on demand from our customers in future periods. Accordingly, current results and financial condition discussed herein may not be indicative of future operating results and trends.Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020 Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin (in thousands, except percentages) 50Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31,20212020Change in$% ofRevenue$% ofRevenue$%RevenueProduct$2,377,727 80.7 %$1,830,842 79.0 %$546,885 29.9 %Service 570,310 19.3 486,670 21.0 83,640 17.2 Total revenue2,948,037 100.0 2,317,512 100.0 630,525 27.2 Cost of revenueProduct958,363 32.5 749,962 32.4 208,401 27.8 Service 108,895 3.7 85,664 3.7 23,231 27.1 Total cost of revenue1,067,258 36.2 835,626 36.1 231,632 27.7 Gross profit$1,880,779 63.8 %$1,481,886 63.9 %$398,893 26.9 %Gross margin63.8 %63.9 %Revenue by Geography (in thousands, except percentages)Year Ended December 31,2021% of Total2020% of TotalAmericas$2,156,183 73.2 %$1,771,992 76.5 %Europe, Middle East and Africa 486,836 16.5 326,729 14.1 Asia-Pacific 305,018 10.3 218,791 9.4 Total revenue $2,948,037 100.0 %$2,317,512 100.0 %Revenue Product revenue primarily consists of sales of our switching and routing products, and software licenses. Service revenue is primarily derived from sales of PCS contracts, which is typically purchased in conjunction with our products, and subsequent renewals of those contracts. We expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing, size, and complexity of orders, especially with respect to our large end customers. Product revenue increased by $546.9 million, or 29.9%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020, which reflected stronger demand for our products from new and existing customers, and broader market acceptance of our enterprise and campus products. Service revenue increased by $83.6 million, or 17.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020, as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal PCS contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand. International revenues increased from 23.5% in 2020 to 26.8% in 2021, which was mostly driven by increased shipments to our large end customers in the EMEA region. Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of product revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our third-party contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors, overhead costs of our manufacturing operations, and other costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory. Cost of service revenue primarily consists of personnel and other costs associated with our global customer support and services organizations.Cost of revenue increased by $231.6 million or 27.7% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. These increases were primarily driven by a corresponding increase in product and service revenues, coupled with an increase in supply chain costs due to increased production capacity and higher volumes.Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a 51Table of Contentsvariety of factors, including pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition, the mix of sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing, manufacturing-related costs, including costs associated with supply chain sourcing activities, merchant silicon costs, the mix of products sold, and excess/obsolete inventory write-downs, including charges for excess/obsolete component inventory held by our contract manufacturers. We expect our gross margins to fluctuate over time, depending on the factors described above. Gross margin slightly decreased from 63.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 63.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in gross margin was unfavorably impacted by higher supply chain costs, as well as increased service costs to support our growing installed base. These unfavorable impacts were mostly offset by improved product margins due to a reduced proportion of our sales to larger end customers who generally receive larger discounts.Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages) Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation and travel expenses.

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, prototype expenses, third-party engineering costs, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs. Our research and development efforts are focused on new product development and maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products, including new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and applications. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and continue to invest in our technology.Research and development expenses increased by $100.2 million, or 20.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $67.0 million increase in personnel costs driven by an increase in headcount, and a $32.3 million increase in new product introduction costs, including third-party engineering and other product development costs.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, marketing, trade shows, and other promotional activities, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide.Sales and marketing expenses increased by $56.8 million, or 24.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by increased headcount and higher sales volume resulting in increased compensation costs, including salaries, sales incentive compensation and stock-based compensation. 52Table of ContentsGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and professional services costs. General and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive, finance, human resources and legal functions. Our professional services costs are primarily related to external legal, accounting, and tax services. General and administrative expenses increased by $16.9 million, or 25.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by a $17.7 million increase in personnel costs, primarily stock-based compensation, which was partially offset by a decrease in non-recurring acquisition-related expenses of $4.2 million resulting from the acquisitions of Big Switch and Awake Security in 2020. Other Income, Net (in thousands, except percentages)Other income, net consists primarily of interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, gains and losses on our investments in privately-held companies and marketable securities, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. We expect other income, net may fluctuate in the future as a result of the re-measurement of our private company equity investments upon the occurrence of either observable price changes or impairments, changes in interest rates or returns on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

In addition, we recorded a gain on sale of marketable securities and a gain on investments in privately-held companies in 2020, which did not recur in 2021.Provision for Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to U.S. income tax. Generally, our U.S. tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these foreign earnings, which avoids double taxation. Our tax expense to date consists of federal, state and foreign current and deferred income taxes.

The decrease in our income taxes and effective tax 53Table of Contentsrate was largely attributable to increased tax benefits from stock-based compensation, combined with a favorable change in jurisdictional mix of earnings. These two factors are variable in nature and past results may not be indicative of future results.

The decrease was primarily due to the recognition of $125.1 million of deferred product revenue in the year ended December 31, 2019 related to customer acceptance of products shipped in prior periods. In addition, we experienced reduced sales to our larger customers during fiscal 2020, combined with the impact of some COVID-19 related supply constraints. Service revenue increased by $97.1 million, or 24.9% in the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal support contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand. International revenues remained relatively constant at 23.5% of total revenues in the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to 23.9% in 2019, with a slight decrease in growth in the EMEA region, mostly offset by an increase in growth in our Asia-Pacific region. International revenue generally fluctuates based on the timing of deployments by certain of our large end customers. Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of revenue decreased by $30.7 million or 3.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in cost of revenue was primarily due to a corresponding decrease in product revenues, 54Table of Contentsand was partially offset by incremental COVID-19 related supply chain costs and increased product transition costs.Gross margin slightly decreased from 64.1% for the year ended December 31, 2019 to 63.9% in 2020. Gross margin was negatively impacted by incremental COVID-19 related supply chain costs and some increased product transition costs, combined with the impact of fixed overhead costs on a lower revenue base. These negative impacts were partially offset by a reduction in sales to our larger end customers who generally receive larger discounts, and improved service margins as we scale our services organization.Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 20202019Change in $% ofRevenue$% ofRevenue$%Operating expenses:Research and development $486,594 20.9 %$462,759 19.2 %$23,835 5.2 %Sales and marketing 229,366 9.9 213,907 8.9 15,459 7.2 General and administrative66,242 2.9 61,898 2.6 4,344 7.0 Total operating expenses$782,202 33.7 %$738,564 30.7 %$43,638 5.9 %Research and development Research and development expenses increased by $23.8 million, or 5.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019.

The change in our income taxes was largely attributable to a net tax benefit of $86 million in 2019 resulting from an intra-entity transaction to sell our non-Americas economic and beneficial intellectual property rights. Further, while we experienced a decrease in worldwide profit before tax in 2020 compared to 2019, the tax benefits attributable to stock-based compensation also decreased, along with an increase in foreign earnings taxed in non-zero rate jurisdictions, resulting in overall higher tax expense. For further information regarding income taxes and the impact on our results of operations and financial position, refer to Note 10. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2021, our total balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $3.4 billion, of which approximately $576.0 million was held outside the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general business purposes, including the funding of working capital. Our marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly-rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We believe that our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing 56Table of Contentscapabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, our costs associated with supply chain activities, including access to outsourced manufacturing, our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies, the continued market acceptance of our products, and stock repurchases. If we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.Cash FlowsYear Ended December 31,202120202019(in thousands)Cash provided by operating activities$1,015,856 $735,114 $963,034 Cash (used in) investing activities (925,562)(608,802)(284,072)Cash (used in) financing activities(360,882)(346,339)(217,964)Effect of exchange rate changes(1,816)1,966 353 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$(272,404)$(218,061)$461,351 Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesOur operating activities consist of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, and changes in assets and liabilities.During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 billion, primarily from net income of $840.9 million and net non-cash adjustments to net income of $181.9 million, partially offset by a net increase of $6.9 million in working capital requirements. The net non-cash adjustments primarily consist of $186.9 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $50.3 million of depreciation and amortization expenses and $26.8 million of amortization of investment premiums (discounts), all of which were offset by the deferred income tax adjustment of $99.3 million. The increase in working capital primarily consisted of a $170.5 million increase in inventory to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions, a $134.8 million increase in prepaid and other current assets primarily driven by an increase in deferred cost of sales associated with higher product revenue deferrals, increased inventory deposits to our contract manufacturers, and higher prepaid taxes and other assets. In addition, we had an increase of $127.0 million in accounts receivables due to increased product and service billings. These cash outflows were largely offset by a $278.5 million increase in deferred revenue reflecting ongoing growth in PCS contracts and increased product deferred revenue related to contracts with acceptance terms. In addition, we had a $66.7 million increase in accounts payable related to the volume and timing of production receipts, and an $83.5 million increase in accrued expenses primarily driven by increased supply chain and development costs, as well as accrued compensation-related costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash provided by operating activities was $735.1 million, primarily from net income of $634.6 million and net non-cash adjustments to net income of $186.2 million, partially offset by a net increase of $85.7 million in working capital requirements. The net non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of $137.0 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $44.6 million of depreciation and amortization expenses. The increase in working capital primarily consisted of a $235.3 million increase in inventory to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions, partially offset by a $50.4 million increase in deferred revenue, a $41.1 million increase in accounts payable related to the timing of production receipts, and a $17.1 million increase in other liabilities primarily due to an increase in customer contract liabilities.57Table of ContentsCash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities consist of our marketable securities investments, business combinations, investments in privately-held companies, and capital expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities was $925.6 million, primarily consisting of purchases of available-for-sale securities of $2.3 billion, investments and notes receivable in private companies of $19.9 million, and purchases of property, equipment and intangible assets of $64.7 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1.5 billion from maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $19.6 million, and the receipt of escrow payments of $1.3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in investing activities was $608.8 million, primarily consisting of purchases of available-for-sale securities of $2.7 billion, $227.4 million for the acquisitions of Big Switch and Awake Security, and purchases of property, equipment and intangible assets of $15.4 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1.5 billion from maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $773.0 million and proceeds from the sale of one of our investments in privately-held companies of $3.4 million.Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesOur financing activities consist of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under employee equity incentive plans, offset by repurchases of our common stock.During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in financing activities was $360.9 million, consisting primarily of payments for repurchases of our common stock of $411.6 million and taxes paid of $16.5 million upon vesting of restricted stock units, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans of $67.2 million.During the year ended December 31, 2020, cash used in financing activities was $346.3 million, consisting primarily of payments for repurchases of our common stock of $395.2 million and taxes paid of $8.7 million upon vesting of restricted stock units, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans of $57.6 million.Stock Repurchase ProgramsIn April 2019, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). This authorization allowed us to repurchase shares of our common stock over three years, and we completed our repurchases under the Repurchase Program during the fourth quarter of 2021. Also in the fourth quarter of 2021, our board of directors authorized an additional $1.0 billion stock repurchase program (the ""New Repurchase Program""). This authorization allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock and will be funded from working capital. The New Repurchase Program commenced in the fourth quarter of 2021 and expires on the three-year anniversary thereof. The New Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any of our common stock and may be suspended or discontinued by the company at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining authorized amount for repurchases under the New Repurchase Program was $927.0 million. Refer to Note 8. Stockholders' Equity and Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Material cash requirements Our material cash requirements will have an impact on our future liquidity. Our material cash requirements represent material expected or contractually committed future payment obligations. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:Leases58Table of ContentsWe have operating lease arrangements for office space, data center, equipment and other corporate assets. As of December 31, 2021, we had lease payment obligations, net of immaterial sublease income, of $87.0 million, with $23.5 million payable within 12 months.Purchase ObligationsPurchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations, made either directly by Arista or by our contract manufacturers on our behalf, in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services. As of December 31, 2021, we had $2.5 billion of such purchase obligations, with $2.3 billion payable within 12 months. These open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, and while we may have some limited ability to reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services, this can only occur with the agreement of the related supplier. In addition to the purchase obligations outlined above, we also entered into an agreement covering an additional $275 million of extended lead-time component purchase commitments in support of 2023 forecasted demand, for which purchase orders had not been issued as of December 31, 2021. Long Term Accrued Income TaxesIn connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we recorded a federal income tax payable for transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings that will be payable over an eight-year period. As of December 31, 2021, $6.3 million of long-term transition tax payable represents the remaining federal income tax payable due between one and three years. In addition to the long-term transition tax payable, as of December 31, 2021 we have recorded long-term tax liabilities of $63.6 million related to uncertain tax positions; however, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments. Off-balance sheet arrangementsAs of December 31, 2021, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Critical Accounting Estimates We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"" or ""U.S. GAAP"") and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. Note 1, “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. Revenue RecognitionWe generate revenue from sales of our products, which incorporate our EOS software and accessories such as cables and optics, to direct customers and channel partners together with PCS. We typically sell products and PCS in a single contract. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or 59Table of Contentsservices to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services. Most of our contracts with customers, other than renewals of PCS, contain multiple performance obligations with a combination of products and PCS. Products and PCS generally qualify as distinct performance obligations. Our hardware includes EOS software, which together deliver the essential functionality of our products. For contracts which contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price (“SSP”). Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for products and PCS sold together in a contract to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and PCS.If we do not have an observable SSP, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, then SSP is estimated using judgment and considering all reasonably available information, such as market conditions and information about the size and/or purchase volume of the customer. We generally use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for individual products and services based on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the sales channel (reseller, distributor or end customer), the geographies in which our products and services are sold, and the size of the end customer.We limit the amount of revenue recognition for contracts containing forms of variable consideration, such as future performance obligations, customer-specific returns, and acceptance or refund obligations. We include some or all of an estimate of the related at-risk consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recorded under each contract will not occur when the uncertainties surrounding the variable consideration are resolved. We may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is generally no contractual provision for such returns. We estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical return rates applied against current-period shipments. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate.We have elected a practical expedient to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar characteristics so long as such application would not differ materially from applying the guidance to the individual contracts (or performance obligations) within that portfolio. Consequently, we have chosen to apply the portfolio approach when possible, which we do not believe will happen frequently. Additionally, we will evaluate a portfolio of data, when possible, in various situations, including accounting for commissions, rights of return and transactions with variable consideration.Inventory Valuation and Contract Manufacturer/Supplier LiabilitiesInventories primarily consist of finished goods and strategic components, primarily integrated circuits. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed using the first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory. We record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand, or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value.Our contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts. We record a liability and a corresponding charge for non-cancellable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers or suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes. We use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures. These estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers, product development plans and current sales levels. In addition, current industry-wide supply chain shortages have resulted in extended lead times for components and have required us to extend the time horizon of our demand forecasts. There is however no guarantee that all suppliers will meet their commitments in the time frame committed or that actual customer demand will directly match our demand forecasts. If actual market demand conditions or supplier execution on commitments are less favorable than those projected by management, which may be caused by factors within and/or outside of our control, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers, which could have 60Table of Contentsan adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer and supplier liabilities.Income Taxes Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for or benefit from income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results and estimates of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain foreign and state tax jurisdictions, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, and potential tax planning strategies. An adjustment to the valuation allowance will either increase or decrease our provision for or benefit from income taxes in the period such determination is made. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, which involves significant judgment in the interpretation of complex domestic and international tax laws and may give rise to uncertain tax positions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not that additional taxes, interest, and penalties will be due. Although management believes our unrecognized tax benefits are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our unrecognized tax benefits. Our unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination or the refinement of an estimate. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRefer to “Recent Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and investments in privately-held companies. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has increased the volatility of global financial markets, which may increase our foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. For further discussion of the potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operating results, and financial condition, see Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, our revenue is not directly subject to foreign currency risk. However, we are indirectly exposed to foreign currency risk. A stronger U.S. dollar could make our products and services more expensive in foreign countries and therefore reduce demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. Such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are also influenced by many other factors.Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe and Asia. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates on our monetary assets and liabilities would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date and do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes, we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.61Table of ContentsInterest Rate SensitivityAs of December 31, 2021, and 2020, we had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities totaling $3.4 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in money market funds, corporate bonds, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. treasury securities and commercial paper. Our primary investment objectives are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements. In addition, our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the U.S. A decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the effect of an immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have been material to our operating results and the total value of the portfolio assuming consistent investment levels. On the other hand, the fair market value of our investments in fixed income securities may be adversely impacted. We would incur unrealized losses on fixed income securities if there is an increase in interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. In the unlikely event we are forced to sell our marketable securities prior to maturity, we may incur realized losses in such investments. However, because of the conservative and short-term nature of the investments in our portfolio, a change in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Investments in Privately-Held CompaniesOur non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded in “Investments” in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately-held companies was $20.2 million and $8.3 million. During fiscal 2021, we did not record any adjustments to our investments. During fiscal 2020, we recorded a net gain of $4.1 million on certain investments, compared to a net gain of $5.4 million during fiscal 2019. See Note 5. Investments of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details. The privately-held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early stages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately-held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.62Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:22:01.260434
1596532,ANET,"Arista Networks, Inc.",2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsYou should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements based upon current plans, expectations and beliefs that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of various factors, including those set forth under “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.Overview Arista Networks is an industry leader in data-driven, cognitive cloud networking for next-generation data center and campus workspace environments. At the core of Arista's platform is our EOS, combined with a set of network applications and our Ethernet switching and routing products using merchant silicon, delivering a cloud networking solution with high performance scale and availability, and enabling network automation, visibility, and security. EOS, combined with a set of network applications and ethernet switching and routing platforms using merchant silicon, provides improved price/performance and time to market, delivering a cloud networking solution with high performance scale and availability, and enabling network automation, visibility, and security. We generate revenue primarily from sales of our switching and routing platforms, which incorporate our EOS software, and related network applications. We also generate revenue from post-contract support (""PCS""), which end customers typically purchase in conjunction with our products, and renewals of PCS. We sell our products through both our direct sales force and our channel partners. As of December 31, 2022, we had delivered our cloud networking solutions to over 9,000 end customers worldwide. Our end customers span a range of industries and include large internet companies, service providers, financial services organizations, government agencies, media and entertainment companies, telecommunication service providers and other cloud service providers. Historically, large purchases by a relatively limited number of end customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenue. We have experienced unpredictability in the timing of orders from these large end customers primarily due to changes in demand patterns specific to these customers, the time it takes these end customers to evaluate, test, qualify and accept our newer products, and the overall complexity of these large orders. For example, sales to our end customers Microsoft and Meta Platforms in fiscal 2022 represented 16% and 26% of our total revenue, respectively, whereas sales to our end customer Microsoft in fiscal 2020 and 2021 amounted to 22% and 15% of our total revenue, respectively, with our end customer Meta Platforms representing less than 10% of our total revenue in both fiscal 2020 and 2021. This variability in customer concentration has been linked to the timing of new product deployments and spending cycles with these customers, and we expect continued variability in our customer concentration and timing of sales on a quarterly and annual basis. Furthermore, we typically provide pricing discounts to large end customers, which may result in lower margins for the period in which such sales occur. We believe that cloud computing represents a fundamental shift from traditional legacy network architectures. As organizations of all sizes have moved workloads to the cloud, spending on cloud and next-generation data centers has increased rapidly, while traditional legacy IT spending has grown more slowly. Our cloud networking platforms are well positioned to address the growing cloud networking market, and to address increasing performance requirements driven by the growing number of connected devices, as well as the need for constant connectivity and access to data and applications. The markets for cloud networking solutions are highly competitive and characterized by rapidly changing technology, changing end-customer needs, evolving industry standards, frequent introductions of new products and services, and industry consolidation. We expect competition to intensify in the future as the market for cloud networking expands and existing competitors and new market entrants introduce new products or enhance existing products. Our future success is dependent upon our ability to continue to evolve and adapt to our rapidly changing environment. We must also continue to develop market-leading products and features that address the needs of our existing and new customers, and increase sales in the enterprise data center switching, and campus workspace markets. We intend to continue expanding our sales force and marketing activities in key geographies, as well as our relationships with channel, technology and system-level partners in order to reach new end customers more effectively, increase sales to existing customers, and provide services and support. In addition, we intend to continue to invest in our research and development organization to enhance the functionality of our existing cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and build upon our technology leadership. We believe one of our greatest strengths lies in our ability to rapidly develop new features and applications.50Table of Contents Our development model is focused on the development of new products based on our EOS software and enhancements to EOS. We engineer our products to be agnostic with respect to the underlying merchant silicon architecture. The programmability of EOS has allowed us to expand our software applications to address the ever-increasing demands of cloud networking, including workflow automation, network visibility, analytics and network detection and response, and has further allowed us to integrate rapidly with a wide range of third-party applications for virtualization, management, automation, orchestration and network services. This enables us to focus our research and development resources on our software core competencies and to leverage the investments made by merchant silicon vendors to achieve cost-effective solutions. We work closely with third-party contract manufacturers to manufacture our products. Our contract manufacturers deliver our products to our third-party direct fulfillment facilities. We and our fulfillment partners then perform labeling, final configuration, quality assurance testing and shipment to our customers.Macroeconomic Update Global economic and business activities continue to face widespread macroeconomic uncertainties, including supply chain constraints, inflation and monetary policy shifts, recession risks, the COVID-19 pandemic, and potential disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and U.S. trade war with China. Although we saw some improvement in our manufacturing and supply chain operations in the latter part of 2022, we continue to experience constraints, with some lingering component shortages, extended lead times, and elevated component and supply chain costs. We continue to work closely with our contract manufacturers and supply chain partners to ramp production following a period of delayed component sourcing and workforce disruptions. Although we have worked diligently to drive improvements in these areas, including funding additional working capital and incremental purchase commitments, these delays have negatively impacted our ability to supply products to our customers on a timely basis. Our demand planning horizon remains extended with high levels of purchase commitments and increased investments in working capital to address delays in component sourcing and the risk of future supply chain disruptions, but we cannot be certain that such delays or disruptions will not occur, or that our extended demand planning horizon will adequately address these disruptions should they occur. In addition, inflation pressure in our supply chain, scarcity of some materials needed to build our products and disruptions to our manufacturing process have increased our cost of revenue and have impacted, and may continue to negatively impact our gross margin. Our operating cash-flows have also been and may continue to be negatively impacted by increased component inventories on hand or at our contract manufacturers, awaiting supply of a limited number of scarce components necessary to build and ship the completed product. While overall demand remains stable, supply chain and manufacturing related constraints could impact our ability to fulfill this demand and as a result could negatively impact our business in future periods. In addition, although our business has experienced limited disruption as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, continued escalation of the conflict may negatively impact the global economy and our future operating results and financial condition. Management continues to actively monitor the impact of these macroeconomic factors on the Company's financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry, and workforce. The extent of the impact of these factors on our operational and financial performance, including our ability to execute our business strategies and initiatives in the expected time frame, will depend on future developments, the impact on our customers, partners, employees, contract manufacturers and supply chain, all of which continue to evolve and are unpredictable; however, any continued or renewed disruption in manufacturing and supply resulting from these factors could negatively impact our business. We also believe that any extended or renewed economic disruptions or deterioration in the global economy could have a negative impact on demand from our customers in future periods. Accordingly, current results and financial condition discussed herein may not be indicative of future operating results and trends.Results of OperationsYear Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 Revenue, Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin (in thousands, except percentages) 51Table of ContentsYear Ended December 31,20222021Change in$% ofRevenue$% ofRevenue$%RevenueProduct$3,716,079 84.8 %$2,377,727 80.7 %$1,338,352 56.3 %Service 665,231 15.2 570,310 19.3 94,921 16.6 Total revenue4,381,310 100.0 2,948,037 100.0 1,433,273 48.6 Cost of revenueProduct1,573,629 35.9 958,363 32.5 615,266 64.2 Service 131,985 3.0 108,895 3.7 23,090 21.2 Total cost of revenue1,705,614 38.9 1,067,258 36.2 638,356 59.8 Gross profit$2,675,696 61.1 %$1,880,779 63.8 %$794,917 42.3 %Gross margin61.1 %63.8 %Revenue by Geography (in thousands, except percentages)Year Ended December 31,2022% of Total2021% of TotalAmericas$3,462,621 79.0 %$2,156,183 73.2 %Europe, Middle East and Africa 529,800 12.1 486,836 16.5 Asia-Pacific 388,889 8.9 305,018 10.3 Total revenue $4,381,310 100.0 %$2,948,037 100.0 %Revenue Product revenue primarily consists of sales of our switching and routing products, and related network applications. Service revenue is primarily derived from sales of PCS contracts, which is typically purchased in conjunction with our products, and subsequent renewals of those contracts. We expect our revenue may vary from period to period based on, among other things, the timing, size, and complexity of orders, especially with respect to our large end customers. Product revenue increased by $1.3 billion, or 56.3%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The increase reflects strong demand for our switching and routing platforms from across our customer base, including healthy contributions from our large cloud customers. Although we saw some improvement in component supply in the latter part of fiscal 2022, supply chain and manufacturing constraints limited our revenue performance throughout the year, and while changes in product deferred revenue impacted the timing of revenue recognition on a quarterly basis, the net change in product deferred revenue for the full year was an immaterial contributor to revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022. In addition, service revenue increased by $94.9 million, or 16.6%, in the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021, as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal PCS contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand. International revenues as a percentage of our total revenues decreased from 26.8% in 2021 to 21.0% in 2022, which was primarily driven by increased purchases from large cloud customers in our Americas region. As a result of cost inflation in our supply chain, we implemented targeted price increases during the year, which began to benefit our revenue in late 2022. As supply chain costs improve, we expect to return to a more competitive pricing environment for our products and services. Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of product revenue primarily consists of amounts paid for inventory to our third-party contract manufacturers and merchant silicon vendors, overhead costs of our manufacturing operations, including freight, and other costs associated with manufacturing our products and managing our inventory and supply chain. Cost of service revenue primarily consists of personnel and other costs associated with our global customer support and services organizations.Cost of revenue increased by $638.4 million, or 59.8% for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. These increases were primarily driven by a corresponding increase in product and service revenues, combined with an increase 52Table of Contentsin material and logistics costs to mitigate supply chain constraints and to meet customer demand, as well as an increase in provisions for excess/obsolete finished goods and component inventory.Gross margin, or gross profit as a percentage of revenue, has been and will continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including pricing pressure on our products and services due to competition, the mix of sales to large end customers who generally receive lower pricing, the mix of products sold, manufacturing-related costs, including costs associated with supply chain sourcing activities, merchant silicon costs, and excess/obsolete inventory charges, including charges for excess/obsolete component inventory with our contract manufacturers and suppliers. We expect our gross margin to fluctuate over time, depending on the factors described above. Gross margin decreased from 63.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 to 61.1% for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease was primarily driven by an increased proportion of our sales to larger end customers who generally receive larger discounts, increased material and logistics costs, and increased excess/obsolete finished goods and component inventory charges, partly offset by the leverage of fixed overhead costs on a higher revenue base.Operating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages) Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. The largest component of our operating expenses is personnel costs. Personnel costs consist of wages, benefits, bonuses and, with respect to sales and marketing expenses, sales commissions. Personnel costs also include stock-based compensation and travel expenses.

Research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, prototype expenses, third-party engineering costs, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs. Our research and development efforts are focused on new product development and maintaining and developing additional functionality for our existing products, including new releases and upgrades to our EOS software and applications. We expect our research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to invest in software development in order to expand the capabilities of our cloud networking platform, introduce new products and features, and continue to invest in our technology.Research and development expenses increased by $141.6 million, or 24.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily due to a $68.6 million increase in personnel costs driven by an increase in headcount, and a $57.5 million increase in new product introduction costs, including third-party engineering and other product development costs.Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs, marketing, trade shows, and other promotional activities, and an allocated portion of facility and IT costs. We expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts worldwide.Sales and marketing expenses increased by $40.8 million, or 14.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was primarily caused by increased personnel costs driven by headcount growth.53Table of ContentsGeneral and administrative. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and professional services costs. General and administrative personnel costs include those for our executive, finance, human resources and legal functions. Our professional services costs are primarily related to external legal, accounting, and tax services. General and administrative expenses increased by $10.1 million, or 12.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to 2021. The increase was driven by an increase in personnel costs driven by increased headcount, and increased legal and professional fees primarily driven by acquisitions during the first half of 2022.Other Income, Net (in thousands, except percentages)Other income (expense), net consists primarily of interest income from our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, gains and losses on our equity investments in privately-held companies and marketable securities, and foreign currency transaction gains and losses. We expect other income (expense), net may fluctuate in the future as a result of the re-measurement of our equity investments upon the occurrence of either observable price changes or impairments, changes in interest rates or returns on our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.

In addition, we had unrealized gains of $27.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2022 related to our equity investments.Provision for Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) We operate in a number of tax jurisdictions and are subject to taxes in each country or jurisdiction in which we conduct business. Earnings from our non-U.S. activities are subject to local country income tax and may also be subject to U.S. income tax. Generally, our U.S. tax obligations are reduced by a credit for foreign income taxes paid on these foreign earnings, which avoids double taxation. Our tax expense to date consists of federal, state and foreign current and deferred income taxes.

Service revenue increased by $83.6 million, or 17.2%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020, as a result of continued growth in initial and renewal PCS contracts as our customer installed base continued to expand. International revenues increased from 23.5% in 2020 to 26.8% in 2021, which was mostly driven by increased shipments to our large end customers in the EMEA region. Cost of Revenue and Gross Margin Cost of revenue increased by $231.6 million or 27.7% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. These increases were primarily driven by a corresponding increase in product and service revenues, coupled with an increase in supply chain costs due to increased production capacity and higher volumes.Gross margin slightly decreased from 63.9% for the year ended December 31, 2020 to 63.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The change in gross margin was unfavorably impacted by higher supply chain costs, as well as increased service costs to support our growing installed base. These unfavorable impacts were mostly offset by improved product margins due to a reduced proportion of our sales to larger end customers who generally receive larger discounts.55Table of ContentsOperating Expenses (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 20212020Change in $% ofRevenue$% ofRevenue$%Operating expenses:Research and development $586,752 19.9 %$486,594 20.9 %$100,158 20.6 %Sales and marketing 286,171 9.7 229,366 9.9 56,805 24.8 General and administrative83,117 2.8 66,242 2.9 16,875 25.5 Total operating expenses$956,040 32.4 %$782,202 33.7 %$173,838 22.2 %Research and development Research and development expenses increased by $100.2 million, or 20.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $67.0 million increase in personnel costs driven by an increase in headcount, and a $32.3 million increase in new product introduction costs, including third-party engineering and other product development costs.Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expenses increased by $56.8 million, or 24.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by increased headcount and higher sales volume resulting in increased personnel costs.General and administrativeGeneral and administrative expenses increased by $16.9 million, or 25.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was driven by a $17.7 million increase in personnel costs, primarily stock-based compensation, which was partially offset by a decrease in non-recurring acquisition-related expenses of $4.2 million resulting from the acquisitions of Big Switch and Awake Security in 2020.

In addition, we recorded a gain on sale of marketable securities and a gain on investments in privately-held companies in 2020, which did not recur in 2021.56Table of ContentsProvision for Income Taxes (in thousands, except percentages) Year Ended December 31, 20212020Change in $% ofRevenue$% ofRevenue$%Provision for income taxes$90,025 3.1 %$104,306 4.5 %$(14,281)(13.7)%Effective tax rate9.7 %14.1 %Despite an increase in pre-tax income in 2021 as compared to 2020, our provision for income taxes and effective tax rate decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease in our income taxes and effective tax rate was largely attributable to increased tax benefits from stock-based compensation, combined with a favorable change in jurisdictional mix of earnings. These two factors are variable in nature and past results may not be indicative of future results. For further information regarding income taxes and the impact on our results of operations and financial position, refer to Note 8. Income Taxes of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our principal sources of liquidity are cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and cash generated from operations. As of December 31, 2022, our total balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities was $3.0 billion, of which approximately $446.9 million was held outside the U.S. in our foreign subsidiaries. Our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are held for general business purposes, including the funding of working capital. Our marketable securities investment portfolio is primarily invested in highly-rated securities, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. We plan to continue to invest for long-term growth. We believe that our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, together with cash generated from operations, will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and our growth strategies for at least the next 12 months. Our future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including our growth rate, the timing and extent of our spending to support research and development activities, the timing and cost of establishing additional sales and marketing capabilities, the introduction of new and enhanced product and service offerings, our costs associated with supply chain activities, including access to outsourced manufacturing, our costs related to investing in or acquiring complementary or strategic businesses and technologies, the continued market acceptance of our products, and stock repurchases. If we require or elect to seek additional capital through debt or equity financing in the future, we may not be able to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we are required and unable to raise additional capital when desired, our business, operating results and financial condition may be adversely affected.Cash FlowsYear Ended December 31,202220212020(in thousands)Cash provided by operating activities$492,813 $1,015,856 $735,114 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 216,327 (925,562)(608,802)Cash (used in) financing activities(654,601)(360,882)(346,339)Effect of exchange rate changes(3,611)(1,816)1,966 Net increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash$50,928 $(272,404)$(218,061)Cash Flows from Operating ActivitiesOur operating activities consist of net income, adjusted for certain non-cash items, and changes in assets and liabilities.During the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by operating activities was $492.8 million, primarily from net income of $1.4 billion and net non-cash adjustments to net income of $53.2 million, partially offset by a net increase of $912.8 million in working capital requirements. Net non-cash adjustments primarily consisted of $230.9 million of stock-based compensation expenses and $62.7 million of depreciation, amortization and other expenses, which were largely offset by an increase in deferred income taxes of $244.4 million primarily resulting from increased deferred tax assets associated with the 57Table of Contentscapitalization of research and development costs under IRC Section 174. The increase in working capital requirements primarily consisted of a $638.9 million increase in inventory in response to a significant increase in business volume, increased lead times and supply chain disruptions, and a $401.5 million increase in accounts receivable due to the larger business volume and timing of shipments in the fourth quarter of 2022, as well as an $85.2 million increase in prepaid and other current assets primarily driven by increased inventory deposits to our contract manufacturers. These cash outflows were largely offset by a $99.0 million increase in deferred revenue driven by a growth in PCS contracts, a $98.0 million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities related to significant business volume, timing of payments, and increased supplier and contract manufacturer liability reserves and a $44 million increase in income taxes, net, due to an increase in our income tax provision and timing of payments. During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash provided by operating activities was $1.0 billion, primarily from net income of $840.9 million and net non-cash adjustments to net income of $181.9 million, partially offset by a net increase of $6.9 million in working capital requirements. The net non-cash adjustments primarily consist of $186.9 million of stock-based compensation expenses, $50.3 million of depreciation and amortization expenses and $26.8 million of amortization of investment premiums (discounts), all of which were offset by the deferred income tax adjustment of $99.3 million. The increase in working capital primarily consisted of a $170.5 million increase in inventory to help mitigate the impact of COVID-19 related supply chain disruptions, a $134.8 million increase in prepaid and other current assets primarily driven by an increase in deferred cost of sales associated with higher product revenue deferrals, increased inventory deposits to our contract manufacturers, and higher prepaid taxes and other assets. In addition, we had an increase of $127.0 million in accounts receivables due to increased product and service billings. These cash outflows were largely offset by a $278.5 million increase in deferred revenue reflecting ongoing growth in PCS contracts and increased product deferred revenue related to contracts with acceptance terms. In addition, we had a $66.7 million increase in accounts payable related to the volume and timing of production receipts, and an $83.5 million increase in accrued expenses primarily driven by increased supply chain and development costs, as well as accrued compensation-related costs. Cash Flows from Investing ActivitiesOur investing activities consist of our marketable securities investments, business combinations, investments in privately-held companies, and capital expenditures. During the year ended December 31, 2022, cash provided by investing activities was $216.3 million, consisting of proceeds of $1.6 billion from maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $193.8 million, partially offset by purchases of available-for-sale securities of $1.4 billion, $145.1 million for business acquisitions, purchases of property, equipment and intangible assets of $44.6 million, and investments and notes receivable in private companies of $12.7 million.During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in investing activities was $925.6 million, primarily consisting of purchases of available-for-sale securities of $2.3 billion, investments and notes receivable in private companies of $19.9 million, and purchases of property, equipment and intangible assets of $64.7 million, partially offset by proceeds of $1.5 billion from maturities of marketable securities, proceeds from the sale of marketable securities of $19.6 million, and the receipt of escrow payments of $1.3 million. Cash Flows from Financing ActivitiesOur financing activities consist of proceeds from the issuance of our common stock under employee equity incentive plans, offset by repurchases of our common stock.During the year ended December 31, 2022, cash used in financing activities was $654.6 million, consisting primarily of common stock repurchases of $670.3 million and taxes paid of $32.7 million upon vesting of restricted stock units, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans of $48.4 million.During the year ended December 31, 2021, cash used in financing activities was $360.9 million, consisting primarily of payments for repurchases of our common stock of $411.6 million and taxes paid of $16.5 million upon vesting of restricted stock units, offset partially by proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee equity incentive plans of $67.2 million.Stock Repurchase Programs58Table of ContentsIn April 2019, our board of directors authorized a $1.0 billion stock repurchase program (the “Repurchase Program”). This authorization allowed us to repurchase shares of our common stock over three years and we completed our repurchases under the Repurchase Program during the fourth quarter of 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2021, our board of directors authorized an additional $1.0 billion stock repurchase program (the ""New Repurchase Program""). This authorization allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock and will be funded from working capital. The New Repurchase Program commenced in the fourth quarter of 2021, and expires on the three-year anniversary thereof. The New Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any of our common stock and may be suspended or discontinued by the company at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2022, the remaining authorized amount for repurchases under the New Repurchase Program was $256.8 million. Refer to Note 6. Stockholders' Equity and Stock-Based Compensation of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion. Material cash requirements Our material cash requirements will have an impact on our future liquidity. Our material cash requirements represent material expected or contractually committed future payment obligations. We believe that we will be able to fund these obligations through cash generated from operations and from our existing balances of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations:LeasesWe have operating lease arrangements for office space, data center, equipment and other corporate assets. As of December 31, 2022, we had lease payment obligations, net of immaterial sublease income, of $71.4 million, with $22.5 million payable within 12 months.Purchase ObligationsPurchase obligations represent an estimate of all non-cancellable open purchase orders and contractual obligations, made either directly by Arista or by our contract manufacturers on our behalf, in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services. As of December 31, 2022, we had $3.7 billion of such purchase obligations, of which $2.9 billion are expected to be received within 12 months, and $0.8 billion are expected to be received after one year. These open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding, and while we may have some limited ability to reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services, this can only occur with the agreement of the related supplier. Accrued Income TaxesAs of December 31, 2022, we have recorded long-term tax liabilities of $83.5 million related to uncertain tax positions; however, we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the timing of settlement, if any, of these future payments.In connection with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (""TCJA""), effective from January 1st, 2022, the TCJA eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures currently and requires taxpayers to capitalize and amortize them over five or fifteen years pursuant to IRC Section 174. As of December 31, 2022, the incremental cash tax impact resulting from the new regulations was approximately $195.0 million for the year, of which substantially all of the liability for the full year has been paid. In addition, we may incur incremental cash taxes of up to $180.0 million in fiscal 2023. No material change to our effective tax rate resulted from this new regulation. Off-balance sheet arrangementsAs of December 31, 2022, we did not have any relationships with any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, that would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes.Critical Accounting Estimates We have prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"" or ""U.S. GAAP"") and include our accounts and the accounts of our wholly owned subsidiaries. 59Table of ContentsThe preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates, assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the applicable periods. Note 1, “Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different assumptions and judgments would change the estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, which, in turn, could change the results from those reported. We evaluate our estimates, assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis. Actual results may differ from these estimates. To the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and our actual results, our future financial statements will be affected. Revenue RecognitionWe generate revenue from sales of our products, which incorporate our EOS software and accessories such as cables and optics, to direct customers and channel partners together with PCS. We typically sell products and PCS in a single contract. We recognize revenue upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to receive in exchange for those products or services. Most of our contracts with customers, other than renewals of PCS, contain multiple performance obligations with a combination of products and PCS. Products and PCS generally qualify as distinct performance obligations. Our hardware includes EOS software, which together deliver the essential functionality of our products. For contracts which contain multiple performance obligations, we allocate revenue to each distinct performance obligation based on the standalone selling price (“SSP”). Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for products and PCS sold together in a contract to determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and PCS.If we do not have an observable SSP, such as when we do not sell a product or service separately, then SSP is estimated using judgment and considering all reasonably available information, such as market conditions and information about the size and/or purchase volume of the customer. We generally use a range of amounts to estimate SSP for individual products and services based on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the sales channel (reseller, distributor or end customer), the geographies in which our products and services are sold, and the size of the end customer.We limit the amount of revenue recognition for contracts containing forms of variable consideration, such as future performance obligations, customer-specific returns, and acceptance or refund obligations. We include some or all of an estimate of the related at-risk consideration in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable that a significant reversal in the amount of cumulative revenue recorded under each contract will not occur when the uncertainties surrounding the variable consideration are resolved. We may occasionally accept returns to address customer satisfaction issues even though there is generally no contractual provision for such returns. We estimate returns for sales to customers based on historical return rates applied against current-period shipments. Specific customer returns and allowances are considered when determining our sales return reserve estimate.We have elected a practical expedient to apply the guidance to a portfolio of contracts or performance obligations with similar characteristics so long as such application would not differ materially from applying the guidance to the individual contracts (or performance obligations) within that portfolio. Consequently, we have chosen to apply the portfolio approach when possible, which we do not believe will happen frequently. Additionally, we will evaluate a portfolio of data, when possible, in various situations, including accounting for commissions, rights of return and transactions with variable consideration.Inventory Valuation and Contract Manufacturer/Supplier LiabilitiesInventories primarily consist of finished goods and strategic components, primarily integrated circuits. Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (computed using the first-in, first-out method) and net realizable value. Manufacturing overhead costs and inbound shipping costs are included in the cost of inventory. We record a provision when inventory is determined to be in excess of anticipated demand, or obsolete, to adjust inventory to its estimated realizable value.60Table of ContentsOur contract manufacturers procure components and assemble products on our behalf based on our forecasts. We record a liability and a corresponding charge for non-cancellable, non-returnable purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers or suppliers for quantities in excess of our demand forecasts or that are considered obsolete due to manufacturing and engineering change orders resulting from design changes. We use significant judgment in establishing our forecasts of future demand and obsolete material exposures. These estimates depend on our assessment of current and expected orders from our customers, product development plans and current sales levels. In addition, industry-wide supply chain shortages have resulted in extended lead times for components and have required us to extend the time horizon of our demand forecasts. There is however no guarantee that all suppliers will meet their commitments in the time frame committed or that actual customer demand will directly match our demand forecasts. If actual market demand conditions or supplier execution on commitments are less favorable than those projected by management, which may be caused by factors within and/or outside of our control, we may be required to increase our inventory write-downs and liabilities to our contract manufacturers and suppliers, which could have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability. We regularly evaluate our exposure for inventory write-downs and adequacy of our contract manufacturer and supplier liabilities.Income Taxes Significant management judgment is required in developing our provision for or benefit from income taxes, including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required against the deferred tax assets. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence, including past operating results and estimates of our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain foreign and state tax jurisdictions, future reversals of taxable temporary differences, and potential tax planning strategies. An adjustment to the valuation allowance will either increase or decrease our provision for or benefit from income taxes in the period such determination is made. We are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions, which involves significant judgment in the interpretation of complex domestic and international tax laws and may give rise to uncertain tax positions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether it is more likely than not that additional taxes, interest, and penalties will be due. Although management believes our unrecognized tax benefits are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which is reflected in our unrecognized tax benefits. Our unrecognized tax benefits are adjusted considering changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax examination or the refinement of an estimate. Resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management’s expectations could have a material impact on our financial condition and operating results.Recent Accounting PronouncementsRefer to the subheading titled “Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements” in Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.61Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskWe are exposed to market risk in the ordinary course of our business. Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. Our market risk exposure is primarily a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, investments in privately-held companies, and marketable equity investments. Macroeconomic uncertainties, including supply chain and labor shortages, inflation and monetary policy shifts, recession risks, the COVID-19 pandemic, and potential disruptions from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and U.S. trade war with China have increased the volatility of global financial markets, which may increase our foreign currency exchange risk and interest rate risk. For further discussion of the potential impacts on our business, operating results, and financial condition, see Risk Factors included in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk Our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Substantially all of our revenue is denominated in U.S. dollars, and therefore, our revenue is not directly subject to foreign currency risk. However, we are indirectly exposed to foreign currency risk. A stronger U.S. dollar could make our products and services more expensive in foreign countries and therefore reduce demand. A weaker U.S. dollar could have the opposite effect. Such economic exposure to currency fluctuations is difficult to measure or predict because our sales are also influenced by many other factors.Our expenses are generally denominated in the currencies in which our operations are located, which is primarily in the U.S. and to a lesser extent in Europe and Asia. Our results of operations and cash flows are, therefore, subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and may be adversely affected in the future due to changes in foreign exchange rates. A hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates on our monetary assets and liabilities would not be material to our financial condition or results of operations. To date, foreign currency transaction gains and losses and exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to our financial statements. While we have not engaged in the hedging of our foreign currency transactions to date and do not enter into any hedging contracts for trading or speculative purposes, we may in the future hedge selected significant transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.Interest Rate SensitivityAs of December 31, 2022, and 2021, we had cash, cash equivalents and available-for-sale marketable securities totaling $3.0 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Cash equivalents and marketable securities were invested primarily in money market funds, corporate bonds, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, U.S. treasury securities and commercial paper. Our primary investment objectives are to preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements. In addition, our policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issuer. We do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes and have not used any derivative financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk exposure. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity, which is affected by changes in the general level of the interest rates in the U.S. A decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the effect of an immediate 10% change in interest rates would not have been material to our operating results and the total value of the portfolio assuming consistent investment levels. On the other hand, the fair market value of our investments in fixed income securities may be adversely impacted. We would incur unrealized losses on fixed income securities if there is an increase in interest rates compared to interest rates at the time of purchase. In the unlikely event we are forced to sell our marketable securities prior to maturity, we may incur realized losses in such investments. However, because of the conservative and short-term nature of the investments in our portfolio, a change in interest rates is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.Investments in Privately-Held Companies and Marketable Equity InvestmentOur non-marketable equity investments in privately-held companies are recorded in “Investments” in our consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total carrying amount of our investments in privately-held companies was $39.5 million and $20.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a net gain of $15.8 million, $0, and $4.1 million, respectively, on certain investments. See Note 2. Fair Value Measurements of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for details. The privately-held companies in which we invested are in the startup or development stages. These investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products these companies are developing are typically in the early 62Table of Contentsstages and may never materialize. We could lose our entire investment in these companies. Our evaluation of investments in privately-held companies is based on the fundamentals of the businesses invested in, including among other factors, the nature of their technologies and potential for financial return.One of our equity investments in a privately-held company completed an initial public offering at the beginning of 2022 and subsequently our investment converted to a marketable equity security and is subject to price risk. This investment generated an unrealized gain of $10.7 million during 2022 and the fair value of the investment was $19.1 million as of December 31, 2022.63Table of Contents",2023-12-30 21:22:03.123967
