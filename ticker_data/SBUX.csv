829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2012,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGeneralOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal year ended on October 3, 2010 included 53 weeks with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter. The fiscal years ended on October 2, 2011 and September 30, 2012 both included 52 weeks. Comparable store sales percentages for fiscal 2010 are calculated excluding the 53rd week. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.Financial Highlights•Total net revenues increased 14% to $13.3 billion in fiscal 2012 compared to $11.7 billion in fiscal 2011. The increase was due primarily to a 7% increase in global comparable store sales, 50% revenue growth in Channel Development, and 20% growth in licensed stores revenue. The comparable store sales growth in company-operated stores was comprised of a 6% increase in the number of transactions and a 1% increase in average ticket.•Consolidated operating income was $2.0 billion in fiscal 2012 compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2011 and operating margin increased to 15.0% compared to 14.8% in fiscal 2011. The operating margin expansion was driven by increased sales leverage and the absence of charges in fiscal 2012 related to the Seattle's Best Coffee store closures in Border's bookstores, partially offset by higher commodity costs. •EPS for fiscal 2012 was $1.79, compared to EPS of $1.62 reported in fiscal 2011, with the increase driven by the improved sales leverage, partially offset by the impact of higher commodity costs in fiscal 2012 and certain gains recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, including a gain from a fair market value adjustment resulting from the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in our joint venture in Switzerland and Austria as well as a gain on the sale of corporate real estate. •Cash flow from operations was $1.8 billion in fiscal 2012 compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2011. Capital expenditures were approximately $856 million in fiscal 2012 compared to $532 million in fiscal 2011. Available operating cash flow after capital expenditures during fiscal 2012 was directed at returning approximately $1.1 billion of cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.OverviewStarbucks results for fiscal 2012 reflect the strength of our global business model. We continue to execute on our new regional operating model which we implemented at the beginning of fiscal 2012. We now have four reportable operating segments: Americas; Europe, Middle East, and Africa (""EMEA""); China / Asia Pacific (""CAP"") and Channel Development. Each segment is managed by an operating segment president. Total net revenues increased 14% to $13.3 billion driven by global comparable store sales growth of 7% and a 50% increase in Channel Development revenue. This growth drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margin and net earnings compared to fiscal 2011. This helped mitigate the impact of higher commodity costs, mostly coffee, which negatively impacted operating income by approximately $214 million for the year, equivalent to approximately 160 basis points of impact on operating margin. Our Americas business continued its strong momentum and contributed 75% of total net revenues in fiscal 2012. The revenue growth for the year was driven by an 8% increase in comparable store sales, comprised of a 6% increase in traffic and a 2% increase in average ticket. This sales growth, combined with a continued focus on operational efficiencies, drove increased sales leverage that offset the impact of higher commodity costs. Looking forward, we expect to continue driving sales growth and profitability through continued store efficiency efforts, new store development, and expanding our pipeline of new product offerings to increase revenues throughout all dayparts.25Table of ContentsEMEA segment results reflect both the investments we have begun making as part of our transformation plan for the region, as well as the macro-economic headwinds we, and others, face there. This resulted in flat comparable store sales and operating income of $10 million for fiscal 2012, a decrease of $30 million compared to fiscal 2011. We started the year by putting in place a new leadership team that is focused on increasing the Starbucks brand presence, health and relevancy across the region, improving the profitability of the existing store base through a focus on revenue growth and operating costs, and identifying opportunities for new store growth through licensing arrangements. We expect the investments we are making as part of this transformation effort will result in improved operating performance as we progress on our plan towards mid-teens operating margin; however, this turnaround will take time to gain traction.CAP segment revenues increased 31%, driven by new store growth and comparable store sales of 15%. This segment continues to grow rapidly and is becoming a more meaningful contributor to overall company profitability. We expect continued growth will be from a mix of new store openings and comparable store sales growth. China continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us as we remain on track to reach our goal of 1,500 stores in 2015. In addition, other key markets such as Japan, Korea, Thailand, Singapore and Indonesia all continue to be profitable and provide a solid foundation for continued growth in the region.Our Channel Development segment represents another important, profitable growth opportunity for us. Channel Development results were a solid contributor to overall revenue growth with a 50% increase in revenues primarily due to sales of Starbucks and Tazo branded K-Cup® portion packs which launched at the start of fiscal 2012 and our transition to a direct distribution model for packaged coffee, which occurred during the second quarter of fiscal 2011. High commodity costs continued to be a significant drag on operating margin; however, despite these higher costs, operating income increased $61 million to $349 million for fiscal 2012. We expect continued innovation and new product offerings such as the Verismo™ system by Starbucks and Starbucks Refreshers™ beverages will drive further growth and profitability within this segment over time.Fiscal 2013 — The View AheadFor fiscal year 2013, we expect moderate revenue growth driven by mid single-digit increased comparable store sales, new store openings and strong growth in the Channel Development business. Licensed stores will comprise between one-half and two-thirds of new store openings.We expect continued robust consolidated operating margin and EPS improvement compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting the strength of our global business and the pipeline of profitable growth initiatives. We expect increased capital expenditures in fiscal 2013 compared to fiscal 2012, reflecting additional investments in store renovations, new store growth and manufacturing capacity.Operating Segment OverviewStarbucks has four reportable operating segments: Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Africa (""EMEA""), China and Asia Pacific (""CAP"") and Channel Development. Seattle’s Best Coffee is reported in “Other,” along with Evolution Fresh, Digital Ventures and unallocated corporate expenses that pertain to corporate administrative functions that support our operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.The Americas, EMEA and CAP segments include company-operated stores and licensed stores. Licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues, but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily incurred by the licensee. The EMEA and CAP segments have a higher relative share of licensed stores versus company-operated stores compared to the Americas segment; however, the Americas segment has been operating significantly longer than the other segments and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the more mature Americas segment has significantly more stores and higher total revenues than the other segments. Average sales per store are also higher in the Americas due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels. 26Table of ContentsStarbucks store base in EMEA and CAP continues to expand and we continue to focus on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets, such as China. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher in certain international markets than in the Americas segment due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to the Americas segment. International markets in the early stages of development require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than the Americas.The Channel Development segment includes packaged coffee and tea, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, single-serve coffee and tea products and other branded product operations worldwide, as well as the US foodservice business. In prior years through the first several months of fiscal 2011, we sold a selection of Starbucks and Seattle’s Best Coffee branded packaged coffees and Tazo® teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the US and to grocery stores in Canada, the UK and other European countries through a distribution arrangement with Kraft Foods Global, Inc. Kraft managed the distribution, marketing, advertising and promotion of these products as a part of that arrangement. During fiscal 2011, we successfully transitioned these businesses including the marketing, advertising, and promotion of these products, from our previous distribution arrangement with Kraft and began selling these products directly to the grocery and warehouse club stores. Our Channel Development segment also includes ready-to-drink beverages, which are primarily manufactured and distributed through The North American Coffee Partnership, a joint venture with the Pepsi-Cola Company. The proportionate share of the results of the joint venture is included, on a net basis, in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings. The US foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broad-line distribution networks. The Channel Development segment reflects a modest cost structure and a resulting higher operating margin, compared to the other reporting segments, which consist primarily of retail stores.AcquisitionsSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10-K.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2012 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2011 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):Revenues Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 %Change Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 % of TotalNet Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores$10,534.5 $9,632.4 9.4% 79.2% 82.3% Licensed stores1,210.3 1,007.5 20.1% 9.1% 8.6% CPG, foodservice and other1,554.7 1,060.5 46.6% 11.7% 9.1% Total net revenues$13,299.5 $11,700.4 13.7% 100.0% 100.0%Consolidated net revenues were $13.3 billion for fiscal 2012, an increase of 13.7%, or $1.6 billion over fiscal 2011, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $902 million), driven by an increase in comparable store sales (approximately 7%, or $680 million). Also contributing to the increase were 27Table of Contentsincremental revenues from net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $184 million).Licensed store revenues contributed $203 million to the increase in total net revenues in fiscal 2012, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees, resulting from improved comparable store sales and the opening of 665 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months.CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $494 million, primarily due to sales of Starbucks and Tazo branded K-Cup® portion packs launched in the CPG channel on November 1, 2011 (approximately $232 million). The benefit of recognizing full revenue from packaged coffee and tea under the direct distribution model (approximately $78 million) and an increase in foodservice revenues (approximately $50 million) also contributed.Operating Expenses Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 % of TotalNet Revenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs$5,813.3 $4,915.5 43.7% 42.0% Store operating expenses3,918.1 3,594.9 29.5% 30.7% Other operating expenses429.9 392.8 3.2% 3.4% Depreciation and amortization expenses550.3 523.3 4.1% 4.5% General and administrative expenses801.2 749.3 6.0% 6.4% Total operating expenses11,512.8 10,175.8 86.6% 87.0% Gain on sale of properties— 30.2 —% 0.3% Income from equity investees210.7 173.7 1.6% 1.5% Operating income$1,997.4 $1,728.5 15.0% 14.8% Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 37.2% 37.3%Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 170 basis points, driven by increased commodity costs (approximately 160 basis points), primarily due to higher coffee costs.Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 120 basis points, due to increased Channel Development and licensed store revenues. Store operating expenses as a percent of company-operated store revenues decreased 10 basis points due to increased sales leverage.Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 20 basis points. As a percentage of net revenues excluding company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 350 basis points. This decrease was primarily driven by increased sales leverage (approximately 150 basis points), the absence of charges in fiscal 2012 related to the Seattle’s Best Coffee store closures in Borders bookstores (approximately 80 basis points) and a shift in the timing of marketing spend (approximately 60 basis points). Income from equity investees increased $37.0 million, primarily due to an increase in income from our North American Coffee Partnership (approximately $13 million), Japan (approximately $11 million) and Shanghai (approximately $10 million) joint venture operations.The combination of these changes, along with increased sales leverage on depreciation and amortization (approximately 40 basis points) and general and administrative expenses (approximately 40 basis points), resulted in an increase in operating margin of 20 basis points over fiscal 2011.28Table of ContentsOther Income and Expenses Fiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 Sep 30, 2012 Oct 2, 2011 % of TotalNet Revenues Operating income$1,997.4 $1,728.5 15.0 % 14.8 % Interest income and other, net94.4 115.9 0.7 % 1.0 % Interest expense(32.7) (33.3) (0.2)% (0.3)% Earnings before income taxes2,059.1 1,811.1 15.5 % 15.5 % Income taxes674.4 563.1 5.1 % 4.8 % Net earnings including noncontrolling interests1,384.7 1,248.0 10.4 % 10.7 % Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests0.9 2.3 — % — % Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$1,383.8 $1,245.7 10.4 % 10.6 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 32.8 % 31.1 %Net interest income and other decreased $21 million over the prior year, primarily due to the absence of the gain recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 resulting from the acquisition of the remaining interest in our previous joint venture operations in Switzerland and Austria (approximately $55 million), partially offset by the recognition of additional income associated with unredeemed gifts cards in the second quarter of fiscal 2012 (approximately $29 million), following a court ruling related to state unclaimed property laws.Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2012 resulted in an effective tax rate of 32.8% compared to 31.1% for fiscal year 2011. The rate increased in fiscal year 2012 primarily due to tax benefits recognized in fiscal 2011 from the Switzerland and Austria transaction and the release of foreign valuation allowances.

Considering the impact from all line items, the primary drivers for the increase in operating margin for fiscal 2011 were increased sales leverage (approximately 300 basis points), the absence of restructuring charges in the current year (approximately 50 basis points) and the gain on the sale of corporate real estate in fiscal 2011 (approximately 30 basis points). These increases were partially offset by higher commodity costs (approximately 220 basis points).35Table of ContentsOther Income and Expenses Fiscal Year EndedOct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010 Oct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010 % of TotalNet Revenues Operating income$1,728.5 $1,419.4 14.8 % 13.3 % Interest income and other, net115.9 50.3 1.0 % 0.5 % Interest expense(33.3) (32.7) (0.3)% (0.3)% Earnings before income taxes1,811.1 1,437.0 15.5 % 13.4 % Income taxes563.1 488.7 4.8 % 4.6 % Net earnings including noncontrolling interests1,248.0 948.3 10.7 % 8.9 % Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests2.3 2.7 — % — % Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$1,245.7 $945.6 10.6 % 8.8 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 31.1 % 34.0 %Net interest income and other increased $66 million over the prior year. The increase primarily resulted from the gain recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 related to our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in our joint venture operations in Switzerland and Austria (approximately $55 million).Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2011 resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.1% compared to 34.0% for fiscal 2010. The lower rate in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a benefit from the Switzerland and Austria transaction and to an increase in income in foreign jurisdictions having lower tax rates.

The increase was primarily driven by an increase in comparable store sales in our company-operated stores of 8% (contributing approximately $590 million), driven by a 5% increase in number of transactions and a 2% increase in average value per transaction. Also contributing to the increase was favorable foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the US dollar (approximately $51 million), primarily in relation to the Canadian dollar, and an increase in product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees (approximately $73 million), primarily due to improved comparable store sales and net new store openings. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $162 million).Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher commodity costs (approximately 140 basis points), mainly coffee, partially offset by increased sales leverage on occupancy costs (approximately 60 basis points).Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 120 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage.Also contributing to the increase in operating margin was the absence of restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 (approximately 30 basis points) and increased sales leverage resulting in lower depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues (contributing 30 basis points). The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 140 basis points for fiscal 2011.

An increase in royalty revenues from and product sales to licensees also contributed (approximately $20 million), due to improved comparable store sales and net new store openings. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $18 million).Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased by 120 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily driven by higher higher commodity costs (approximately 160 basis points), mainly coffee, partially offset by increased sales leverage on occupancy costs (approximately 50 basis points).Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 270 basis points. Increased licensed stores revenues contributed approximately 40 basis points to the decrease. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues decreased 230 basis points primarily due to fewer impairment charges in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010 (approximately 110 basis points), lower equipment maintenance costs (approximately 60 basis points) and increased sales leverage on salaries and benefits (approximately 40 basis). Also contributing to the increase in operating margin was the absence of restructuring charges in fiscal 2011 (approximately 260 basis points). The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 440 basis points for fiscal 2011.

The increase was primarily driven by an increase in comparable store sales in our company-operated stores of 22% (contributing approximately $58 million), driven by a 20% increase in number of transactions and a 2% increase in average value per transaction. Also contributing to the increase in total net revenues was favorable foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the US dollar (approximately $40 million), the opening of 73 net new company-operated stores in the past 12 months (approximately $40 million), and an increase in royalty revenues 38Table of Contentsfrom and product sales to licensees (approximately $17 million), due to improved comparable store sales and net new store openings. These increases were partially offset by the absence of the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $9 million).Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased by 130 basis points compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased sales leverage on occupancy costs.Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 60 basis points. Excluding the impact of licensed store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 230 basis points as a percent of company-operated store revenues in fiscal 2011 compared to fiscal 2010, primarily driven by lower compensation costs (approximately 210 basis points) as a percentage of total net revenues.Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 90 basis points. Increased company-operated store revenues contributed approximately 30 basis points to the decrease. Other operating expenses as a percentage of licensed store revenues decreased 60 basis points, primarily driven by lower compensation related costs (approximately 140 basis points), partially offset by increasing costs related to our expansion efforts into key emerging markets, primarily China. Income from equity investees increased $20 million in fiscal 2011, driven by improved performance in our joint venture operations, primarily in Japan, Shanghai and Taiwan. The changes in the above line items combined with increased sales leverage on general and administrative expenses (approximately 70 basis points) and depreciation and amortization (approximately 60 basis points) contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 320 basis points in fiscal 2011.Channel DevelopmentFiscal Year EndedOct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010 Oct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010 As a % of Channel DevelopmentTotal Net RevenuesTotal net revenues$860.5 $707.4 100.0% 100.0%Cost of sales including occupancy costs487.5 383.2 56.7% 54.2%Other operating expenses151.8 115.6 17.6% 16.3%Depreciation and amortization expenses2.4 3.7 0.3% 0.5%General and administrative expenses6.6 4.5 0.8% 0.6%Total operating expenses648.3 507.0 75.3% 71.7%Income from equity investees75.6 70.6 8.8% 10.0%Operating income$287.8 $271.0 33.4% 38.3%RevenuesTotal Channel Development net revenues for fiscal 2011 increased 22%, or $153 million. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of recognizing full revenue from packaged coffee and tea sales under the direct distribution model for the majority of the year (approximately $70 million). On March 1, 2011, we successfully transitioned to a direct distribution model from our previous distribution arrangement with Kraft for the sale of packaged Starbucks® and Seattle’s Best Coffee® coffee products in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the US, and to grocery stores in Canada, the UK and other European countries. We successfully transitioned the Tazo® tea business to a direct distribution model in January 2011. Also contributing to the increase were improved revenues from US foodservice (approximately $26 million) and the expanded distribution of Starbucks VIA® 39Table of ContentsReady Brew in fiscal 2011 (approximately $24 million), partially offset by the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $16 million).Operating ExpensesOperating margin decreased 490 basis points over the prior year primarily due to increased commodity costs (approximately 830 basis points), driven by higher coffee costs. Partially offsetting the increase in commodity costs was the benefit of price increases (approximately 200 basis points) and lower marketing expenses for Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew in 2011 (approximately 120 basis points).OtherFiscal Year EndedOct 2, 2011 Oct 3, 2010 %ChangeTotal net revenues$175.8 $150.8 16.6 %Cost of sales103.0 89.6 15.0 %Other operating expenses93.0 34.9 166.5 %Depreciation and amortization expenses58.6 47.4 23.6 %General and administrative expenses584.0 558.1 4.6 %Total operating expenses838.6 730.0 14.9 %Gain on sale of properties30.2 — nmLoss from equity investee(2.4) (3.3) (27.3)%Operating loss$(635.0) $(582.5) 9.0 %Substantially all net revenues in Other are generated from the Seattle’s Best Coffee operating segment. The increase in revenues for Seattle’s Best Coffee was primarily due to the recognition of a full year of sales to national accounts added in the latter part of fiscal 2010 as well as new accounts added during fiscal 2011(approximately $20 million). This was partially offset by the impact of the closure of the Seattle’s Best Coffee locations in Borders Bookstores.Total operating expenses in fiscal 2011 increased 15%, or $109 million. This increase is the result of an increase of $59 million in other operating expenses primarily due to the impairment of certain assets in our Seattle’s Best Coffee business associated with the Borders bankruptcy in April 2011 and an increase in marketing expenses. Also contributing was a $26 million increase in general and administrative expenses due to higher corporate expenses to support growth initiatives and higher donations to the Starbucks Foundation. These increases in operating expenses were partially offset by a gain on the sale of corporate real estate in fiscal 2011 (approximately $30 million).40Table of ContentsSUMMARIZED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION (unaudited; in millions, except EPS) First Second Third Fourth Total2012: Net revenues$3,435.9 $3,195.9 $3,303.6 $3,364.2 $13,299.5Operating income556.0 430.4 491.6 519.6 1,997.4Net earnings attributable to Starbucks382.1 309.9 333.1 359.0 1,383.8EPS — diluted$0.50 $0.40 $0.43 $0.46 $1.792011: Net revenues$2,950.8 $2,785.7 $2,932.2 $3,031.9 $11,700.4Operating income501.9 376.1 402.2 448.3 1,728.5Net earnings attributable to Starbucks346.6 261.6 279.1 358.5 1,245.7EPS — diluted$0.45 $0.34 $0.36 $0.47 $1.62 FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESInvestment OverviewStarbucks cash and short-term investments were $2.0 billion and $2.1 billion as of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, respectively. As of September 30, 2012, approximately $703 million of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries. Of our cash held in foreign subsidiaries, $343 million is denominated in the US dollar. We actively manage our cash and short-term investments in order to internally fund operating needs domestically and internationally, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our short-term investments consisted predominantly of US Treasury securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and US Agency securities. Also included in our short-term investment portfolio are certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service, with maturities ranging from 91 days to one year. The principal amounts of the individual certificates of deposit do not exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. Our portfolio of long-term available for sale securities consists predominantly of high investment-grade corporate bonds, diversified among industries and individual issuers, as well as certificates of deposits with maturities greater than 1 year.Borrowing capacityIn November 2010, we replaced our previous credit facility with a new $500 million unsecured credit facility (""the credit facility”) with various banks, of which $100 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit. The credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases and is currently set to mature in November 2014. Starbucks has the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. The interest rate for any borrowings under the credit facility, based on Starbucks current ratings and fixed charge coverage ratio, is 0.85% over LIBOR. The specific spread over LIBOR will depend upon our long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies and our fixed charge coverage ratio. The credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.Under our commercial paper program we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 million, with individual maturities that may vary, but not 41Table of Contentsexceed 397 days from the date of issue. The program is backstopped by the credit facility and the combined borrowing limit is $500 million for the commercial paper program and the credit facility. Starbucks may issue commercial paper from time to time, and the proceeds of the commercial paper financing may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. During fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2011, there were no borrowings under the credit facility or commercial paper programs. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, a total of $18 million and $17 million, respectively, in letters of credit were outstanding under the revolving credit facility.The $550 million of 10-year 6.25% Senior Notes also require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.Use of CashWe expect to use our cash and short-term investments, including any potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in our core businesses, including new product innovations and related marketing support, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses. We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and short-term investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future.We consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of September 30, 2012 to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no US income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the US to satisfy domestic liquidity needs; however, in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the US we would be subject to additional US income taxes, which could be material. We do not believe it is practical to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation, as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation, including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation, tax rates in effect, and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation.We may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding.As discussed further in Note 15, we are in arbitration with Kraft Foods Global, Inc. (“Kraft”) for a commercial dispute relating to a distribution agreement we previously held with Kraft. As a part of those proceedings Kraft has claimed damages inclusive of a premium and interest for terminating the arrangement. We believe we have valid claims of material breach by Kraft under the Agreement. We also believe Kraft’s claim is highly inflated and based upon faulty analysis. However, should the arbitration result in an unfavorable outcome, we believe we have adequate liquidity.Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2013 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing company-operated stores; systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure; new company-operated stores; and additional investments in manufacturing capacity. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2013 are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion.During the first three quarters of fiscal 2011, we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.13 per share. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2012 we declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.17 per share. Cash dividends paid in fiscal 2012 and 2011 totaled $513 million and $390 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter, we declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share to be paid on November 30, 2012 with an expected payout of $157 million.42Table of ContentsDuring fiscal years 2012 and 2011, we repurchased 12 million and 16 million shares of common stock ($593 million and $556 million, respectively) under share repurchase authorizations. The number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at September 30, 2012 totaled 12.1 million. On November 14, 2012, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 25 million shares under our share repurchase program.Cash FlowsCash provided by operating activities was $1.8 billion for fiscal year 2012, compared to $1.6 billion for fiscal year 2011. The slight increase was primarily attributable to an increase in net earnings in fiscal 2012. This was partially offset by a net increase in our working capital accounts, due primarily to increased payments on accounts payable. Cash used by investing activities totaled $1.0 billion for fiscal years 2012 and 2011. Net cash proceeds on investment maturities were offset by an increase in capital expenditures, primarily for remodeling and renovating existing company-operated stores and opening new retail stores, the absence of cash proceeds from the sale of corporate real estate in the prior year and cash paid to acquire Evolution Fresh and Bay Bread, LLC (doing business as La Boulange) in the first and fourth quarters of fiscal 2012, respectively.Cash used by financing activities for fiscal year 2012 totaled $746 million, compared to $608 million for fiscal year 2011. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholders through higher dividend payments in fiscal 2012.The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 30, 2012, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations(1)Total Less than 1Year 1 - 3Years 3 - 5Years More than5 YearsOperating lease obligations(2)$4,060.2 $787.9 $1,368.9 $934.9 $968.5Purchase obligations(3)911.0 727.9 170.0 13.1 —Debt obligations(4)722.0 34.4 68.8 618.8 —Other obligations(5)94.9 19.4 9.6 8.3 57.6Total$5,788.1 $1,569.6 $1,617.3 $1,575.1 $1,026.1(1)Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.

We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and can be expected to impact our future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. In general, hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years.The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.Commodity Price RiskWe purchase commodity inputs, including coffee, dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. In addition to fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 30, 2012 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying RateCommodity hedges$10 $(10) $13 $(13)Foreign Currency Exchange RiskThe majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in US dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the US, we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound, euro, and Japanese yen. As a result, we may engage in 44Table of Contentstransactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues, inventory purchases, assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.As of September 30, 2012, we had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases. In addition, we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in Starbucks Japan to minimize foreign currency exposure.Starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes (free standing derivatives), but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables. Increases or decreases in the fair value of these derivatives are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the US dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables (i.e. “hedged items”) that would occur within the period.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 30, 2012 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the US dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates.

The trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). A corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of September 30, 2012 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.Interest Rate RiskWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt. As of September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011, we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding.The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of September 30, 2012 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): Change in Fair Value Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying Rate Debt$674 $29 $(29)Our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component 45Table of Contentsof accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for-sale securities. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2012, and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESCritical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:Asset ImpairmentWhen facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment. We first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we measure an impairment loss based on the asset’s estimated fair value. For retail assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on internal projections. Key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth, operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider a store’s historical performance, local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. These estimates are subjective and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions. For non-retail assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting asset useful lives. Further, our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess long-lived asset impairment loss. For the foreseeable future, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Goodwill ImpairmentWe test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if circumstances, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values.When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than the carrying amount. If not, we calculate the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value. The fair value of each of our reporting units is the price a 46Table of Contentswilling buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. Key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth, operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering a reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital for a retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions.Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions in the qualitative assessment of the reporting unit and require management to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, including estimating future cash flows, and if necessary, the fair value of a reporting units’ assets and liabilities. Further, our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance, and changes in our business strategies.As a part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. Under GAAP, when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. As noted above, if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level, we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur.During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess goodwill impairment loss. For fiscal 2012, we determined the fair value of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their carrying values. Accordingly, we did not recognize any goodwill impairments during the current fiscal year. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill in the foreseeable future. However, as we periodically reassess our fair value calculations, including estimated future cash flows, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Self Insurance ReservesWe use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, and director and officers’ liability insurance. Key assumptions used in the estimate of our self insurance reserves include the amount of claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. These liabilities, which are associated with the risks that are retained by Starbucks are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic, exposure and severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends.Our self-insurance reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. Periodically, we review our assumptions to determine the adequacy of our self-insurance reserves.47Table of ContentsDuring the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to calculate our self-insurance reserves. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our self-insurance reserves for the foreseeable future. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at September 30, 2012 would have affected net earnings by approximately $10 million in fiscal 2012.Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions; we recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefits liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when new information becomes available.Income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions has not been subject to US income taxes. We intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. If these amounts were distributed to the US, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional US income taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits, and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.Litigation AccrualsWe are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. Legal and other contingency reserves and related disclosures are based on our assessment of the likelihood of a potential loss and our ability to estimate the loss or range of loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. We record reserves related to legal matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances and historical experience with similar claims, as necessary.Our disclosures of and accruals for litigation claims, if any, contain uncertainties because management is required to use judgment to estimate the probability of a loss and a range of possible losses related to each claim. Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements describes the Company’s legal and other contingent liability matters.48Table of ContentsAs we periodically review our assessments of litigation accruals, we may change our assumptions with respect to loss probabilities and ranges of potential losses. Any changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. We do not expect these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Commodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Report.49Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:46:18.388242
829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2013,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGeneralOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal years ended on September 29, 2013, September 30, 2012 and October 2, 2011 all included 52 weeks. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.Financial Highlights•Total net revenues increased 12.0% to $14.9 billion in fiscal 2013 compared to $13.3 billion in fiscal 2012. •Global comparable store sales grew 7% driven by a 5% increase in the number of transactions and a 2% increase in average ticket.•Consolidated operating income decreased to $(0.3) billion in fiscal 2013 compared to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2012 and fiscal 2013 operating margin was (2.2)% compared to 15.0% in fiscal 2012. The declines were due to the litigation charge noted below.•EPS for fiscal 2013 decreased to $0.01, compared to EPS of $1.79 in fiscal 2012. The decline was due to the litigation charge noted below.•Arbitration concluded on litigation with Kraft Foods Global, Inc. (""Kraft"") on November 12, 2013, which resulted in a pretax charge to fiscal 2013 operating results of $2.8 billion. This charge reduced EPS by $2.25 per share in fiscal 2013.•Cash flow from operations was $2.9 billion in fiscal 2013 compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2012. Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion in fiscal 2013 compared to $856 million in fiscal 2012. •Available operating cash flow after capital expenditures during fiscal 2013 was directed at returning $1.2 billion of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.OverviewStarbucks segment results for fiscal 2013 demonstrate the fundamental health of our global business model and our continued ability to successfully execute new growth initiatives in a disciplined manner. Our strong revenue growth of 12% and continued segment margin expansion drove increased operating cash flows, which allowed us to both fund our growth initiatives and increase cash returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.The Americas segment continued its strong performance in fiscal 2013, with revenues growing 11% and comparable store sales growth of 7%. Strength in beverage innovation and promotions, operational improvements, and expanded food offerings all contributed to the increase in comparable store sales. Operating margin expanded 120 basis points to 21.5%, driven by sales leverage, store efficiencies, and lower commodity costs. Looking forward, we expect to continue to drive sales growth and profitability through new stores and enhanced product offerings, including the continued roll out of La Boulange™ bakery items into all of our company-operated stores by the end of fiscal 2014.In the EMEA segment, we are continuing to make steady progress toward long-term profitability in the region. Revenues grew 2% compared to the prior year, with licensed store revenue growth nearly offset by a decline in company-operated store revenues. This reflects the shift in our ownership structure, as we have closed underperforming company-operated stores and are focused on growing our licensed store base in profitable locations. Comparable store sales were flat year over year, but were modestly positive in the second half of fiscal 2013. EMEA operating margin improved to 5.5% in fiscal 2013 due to our ongoing cost management efforts and our store portfolio optimization activities which began in the prior year. We expect the investments we are making in this segment will result in improved operating performance as we progress on our plan towards mid-teens operating margin over time.Our CAP segment results reflect a combination of rapid new store growth and solid performance from our existing store base, including our joint venture operations in China and Japan. New store growth, along with a 9% increase in comparable store sales, drove a 27% increase in total net revenues for fiscal 2013. Operating income grew 27% to $321 million and operating margin was unchanged at 35%, primarily due to our rapid growth shifting away from our historically licensed model. We expect this segment will become a more meaningful contributor to overall company profitability in the future, as we look forward to continued store openings and establishing China as our largest market outside of the US. 21Table of ContentsChannel Development segment revenues grew 10% in fiscal 2013, primarily due to increased sales of premium single serve products. Lower coffee costs was the primary contributor to the 290 basis point increase in operating margin for fiscal 2013. As we continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores, including growing our presence in the premium single serve category, we expect this segment will become a more significant contributor to our future growth.Our consolidated operating results included a litigation charge as a result of the conclusion of our arbitration with Kraft which resulted in a pretax charge to operating expenses of $2.8 billion. The conclusion of this litigation is described in more detail in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe we have adequate liquidity to fund this expected payment, both in the form of cash on hand and the expected issuance of additional debt in fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2014 — The View AheadFor fiscal year 2014, we expect revenue growth driven by mid-single-digit global comparable store sales growth, 1,500 new store openings, and continued growth in the Channel Development business. We expect fiscal year 2014 consolidated operating margin improvement, when compared to our fiscal 2013 operating results excluding the litigation charge associated with the Kraft arbitration, of 150 to 200 basis points and strong EPS growth, driven primarily by leverage on revenue growth.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 is expected to be approximately 34.5%.Capital expenditures in fiscal 2014 are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion, primarily for store renovations and new stores, as well for other investments to support our ongoing growth initiatives.Operating Segment OverviewStarbucks has four reportable operating segments: 1) Americas, inclusive of the US, Canada, and Latin America markets; 2) Europe, Middle East, and Africa, (""EMEA""); 3) China / Asia Pacific (“CAP”) and 4) Channel Development. All Other Segments includes Teavana, Seattle's Best Coffee and Evolution Fresh, as well as our Digital Ventures business. The Americas, EMEA and CAP segments include company-operated stores and licensed stores. Licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues, but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily incurred by the licensee. The EMEA and CAP segments have a higher relative share of licensed stores versus company-operated stores compared to the Americas segment; however, the Americas segment has been operating significantly longer than the other segments and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the more mature Americas segment has significantly more stores and higher total revenues than the other two segments. Average sales per store are also higher in the Americas due to various factors including length of time in market.In certain international markets occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher than in the US market due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to the US market. International markets in the early stages of development require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than the US market.We continue to add new stores in both existing, more-mature markets such as the US, and in newer, higher growth markets such as China. Our disciplined approach to expanding our global store base also includes optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores in each market.Our Channel Development segment includes whole bean and ground coffees, premium Tazo® teas, Starbucks- and Tazo-branded single serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Starbucks Refreshers™ beverages, and other branded products sold worldwide through channels such as grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores, and US foodservice accounts. Ready-to-drink beverages are primarily manufactured and distributed through The North American Coffee Partnership, a joint venture with the Pepsi-Cola Company. The proportionate share of the results of the joint venture is included, on a net basis, in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings. AcquisitionsSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions.22Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2013 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2012 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):Revenues Fiscal Year EndedSep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 %Change Sep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 % of TotalNet Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores$11,793.2 $10,534.5 11.9% 79.2% 79.2% Licensed stores1,360.5 1,210.3 12.4% 9.1% 9.1% CPG, foodservice and other1,738.5 1,554.7 11.8% 11.7% 11.7% Total net revenues$14,892.2 $13,299.5 12.0% 100.0% 100.0%Total net revenues were $14.9 billion for fiscal 2013, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 12%, over fiscal 2012, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.3 billion). The increase in company-operated store revenue was driven by an increase in comparable store sales (7%, or approximately $720 million) and incremental revenues from 492 net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $386 million). Licensed store revenue growth contributed $150 million to the increase in total net revenues in fiscal 2013, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees, as a result of improved comparable store sales and the opening of 843 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months.CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $184 million, primarily driven by increased sales of premium single serve products (approximately $116 million) and increased foodservice sales (approximately $37 million).Operating Expenses Fiscal Year EndedSep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 Sep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 % of TotalNet Revenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs$6,382.3 $5,813.3 42.9 % 43.7% Store operating expenses4,286.1 3,918.1 28.8 % 29.5% Other operating expenses457.2 429.9 3.1 % 3.2% Depreciation and amortization expenses621.4 550.3 4.2 % 4.1% General and administrative expenses937.9 801.2 6.3 % 6.0% Litigation charge2,784.1 — 18.7 % —% Total operating expenses15,469.0 11,512.8 103.9 % 86.6% Income from equity investees251.4 210.7 1.7 % 1.6% Operating income/(loss)$(325.4) $1,997.4 (2.2)% 15.0% Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 36.3 % 37.2%Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 80 basis points, primarily due to lower commodity costs (approximately 50 basis points), driven by a decrease in coffee costs.Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 90 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage in our Americas segment (approximately 90 basis points) and store portfolio optimization initiatives in Europe that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 (approximately 50 basis points). This was partially offset by the addition of Teavana and continued investment in our emerging brands (approximately 60 basis points). 23Table of ContentsOther operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. As a percentage of non-company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 70 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage (approximately 40 basis points) and decreased marketing expenses (approximately 20 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 30 basis points, primarily driven by increased costs to support overall company growth and the costs related to our October Global Leadership Conference.Income from equity investees increased $41 million, primarily due to increased income from of our joint venture operations in Japan and China, as well as improved performance from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, which produces, bottles and distributes our ready-to-drink beverages.Litigation charge of $2,784.1 million reflects the accrual we recorded as a result of the conclusion of the arbitration with Kraft. This charge includes $2,227.5 million in damages and $556.6 million in estimated interest and attorneys' fees.The combination of the above resulted in an operating loss of $325.4 million and operating margin of (220) basis points.Other Income and Expenses Fiscal Year EndedSep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 Sep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 % of TotalNet Revenues Operating income/(loss)$(325.4) $1,997.4 (2.2)% 15.0 % Interest income and other, net123.6 94.4 0.8 % 0.7 % Interest expense(28.1) (32.7) (0.2)% (0.2)% Earnings/(loss) before income taxes(229.9) 2,059.1 (1.5)% 15.5 % Income taxes(238.7) 674.4 (1.6)% 5.1 % Net earnings including noncontrolling interests8.8 1,384.7 0.1 % 10.4 % Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests0.5 0.9 — % — % Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$8.3 $1,383.8 0.1 % 10.4 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 103.8 % 32.8 %Net interest income and other increased $29 million over the prior year, primarily due to gains on the sale of the equity in our Chile and Argentina joint ventures in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $45 million) and in Mexico in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $35 million). These gains were partially offset by the absence of additional income recognized in the prior year associated with unredeemed gift cards following a court ruling related to state unclaimed property laws (approximately $29 million). Also offsetting the gains were unfavorable mark-to-market adjustments in fiscal 2013 compared to favorable mark-to-market adjustments in fiscal 2012 from derivatives used to manage our risk of commodity price fluctuations (approximately $24 million).Income taxes for fiscal year 2013 resulted in an effective tax rate of 103.8% compared to 32.8% for fiscal year 2012. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to the impact of the litigation charge associated with the Kraft arbitration in fiscal 2013. For additional information on the impact to our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate from the litigation charge, see Note 13 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Excluding the impact of the litigation charge, the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2013 decreased slightly compared to fiscal 2012 primarily due to benefits from releasing certain tax reserves in fiscal 2013 and a further benefit in fiscal 2013 primarily relating to state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years. These items were partially offset by a decrease in tax benefits relating to coffee procurement in the current year. 24Table of ContentsSegment InformationThe following tables summarize the results of operations by segment (in millions):Americas Fiscal Year EndedSep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 Sep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 As a % of Americas Total Net Revenues Total net revenues$11,000.8 $9,936.0 100.0% 100.0% Cost of sales including occupancy costs4,214.9 3,885.5 38.3% 39.1% Store operating expenses3,710.2 3,427.8 33.7% 34.5% Other operating expenses96.9 83.8 0.9% 0.8% Depreciation and amortization expenses429.3 392.4 3.9% 3.9% General and administrative expenses186.7 128.2 1.7% 1.3% Total operating expenses8,638.0 7,917.7 78.5% 79.7% Income from equity investees2.4 2.1 —% —% Operating income$2,365.2 $2,020.4 21.5% 20.3% Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 37.0% 37.8%RevenuesAmericas total net revenues for fiscal 2013 increased $1.1 billion, or 11%, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $961 million) and licensed stores (contributing $90 million).The increase in company-operated store revenues was driven by an increase in comparable store sales (7%, or approximately$676 million) and incremental revenues from 276 net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $273 million). The increase in licensed stores revenue was due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees as a result of improved comparable store sales and the opening of 404 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months.Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 80 basis points, primarily due to store initiatives to reduce waste (approximately 40 basis points) and lower commodity costs (approximately 30 basis points), driven by a decrease in coffee costs. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues (as well as a percentage of company-operated store revenues) decreased 80 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage (approximately 60 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points primarily due to the costs related to our October Global Leadership Conference (approximately 20 basis points).The combination of these changes resulted in an increase in operating margin of 120 basis points over fiscal 2012.25Table of ContentsEMEA Fiscal Year EndedSep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 Sep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 As a % of EMEA Total Net Revenues Total net revenues$1,160.0 $1,141.3 100.0% 100.0% Cost of sales including occupancy costs590.9 597.3 50.9% 52.3% Store operating expenses339.4 371.1 29.3% 32.5% Other operating expenses38.5 33.6 3.3% 2.9% Depreciation and amortization expenses55.5 57.1 4.8% 5.0% General and administrative expenses71.9 75.7 6.2% 6.6% Total operating expenses1,096.2 1,134.8 94.5% 99.4% Income from equity investees0.4 0.3 —% —% Operating income$64.2 $6.8 5.5% 0.6% Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 36.4% 38.3%RevenuesEMEA total net revenues for fiscal 2013 increased $19 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2012. Licensed stores revenue grew $51 million, or 36%, due to increased product sales to and higher royalty revenues from licensees, primarily from the opening of 129 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales. This growth was largely offset by a decline of $36 million in company-operated stores revenue resulting from our store portfolio optimization activities which began in the prior year. Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 140 basis points, primarily due to lower occupancy costs resulting from our store portfolio optimization initiatives in Europe that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 (approximately 120 basis points) and a reduction to the estimated asset retirement obligations of our store leases in the region in fiscal 2013 (approximately 70 basis points). These improvements were partially offset by the impact of the shift in composition of our store portfolio in the region to more licensed stores, which have a lower gross margin.Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 320 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 190 basis points, primarily from our store portfolio optimization initiatives (approximately 120 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points. As a percentage of non-company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 250 basis points, mainly driven by sales leverage (approximately 180 basis points).The above changes contributed to an overall improvement in operating margin of 490 basis points over fiscal 2012. 26Table of ContentsChina / Asia Pacific Fiscal Year EndedSep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 Sep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 As a % of CAP Total Net Revenues Total net revenues$917.0 $721.4 100.0% 100.0% Cost of sales including occupancy costs449.5 362.8 49.0% 50.3% Store operating expenses170.0 119.2 18.5% 16.5% Other operating expenses46.1 47.0 5.0% 6.5% Depreciation and amortization expenses33.8 23.2 3.7% 3.2% General and administrative expenses48.4 39.0 5.3% 5.4% Total operating expenses747.8 591.2 81.5% 82.0% Income from equity investees152.0 122.4 16.6% 17.0% Operating income$321.2 $252.6 35.0% 35.0% Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 25.3% 24.4%RevenuesChina/Asia Pacific total net revenues for fiscal 2013 increased $196 million, or 27%, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $183 million), driven by the opening of 240 net new stores over the past 12 months (approximately $129 million) and a 9% increase in comparable store sales (approximately $43 million).

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESInvestment OverviewStarbucks cash and short-term investments were $3.2 billion and $2.0 billion as of September 29, 2013 and September 30, 2012, respectively. As of September 29, 2013, approximately $994.4 million of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries. Of our cash held in foreign subsidiaries, $527.4 million is denominated in the US dollar. We actively manage our cash and short-term investments in order to internally fund operating needs domestically and internationally, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our short-term investments consisted predominantly of US Treasury securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and US Agency securities. Also included in our short-term investment portfolio are certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service, with maturities ranging from 91 days to one year. The principal amounts of the individual certificates of deposit do not exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. Our portfolio of long-term available for sale securities consists predominantly of high investment-grade corporate bonds, diversified among industries and individual issuers.Borrowing capacityOur previous $500 million unsecured, revolving credit facility (the “2010 credit facility”) was set to mature in November 2014. In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we replaced the 2010 credit facility with a new $750 million unsecured, revolving credit facility (the “2013 credit facility”) with various banks, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit. The 2013 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases, and is currently set to mature on February 5, 2018. Starbucks has the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $750 million. Borrowings under the 2013 credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for US dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2013 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies, and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the 2013 credit facility. The current applicable margin is 0.795% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.00% for Base Rate Loans. The 2013 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As a result of the arbitrator’s ruling on the Kraft litigation, which is discussed further in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, the credit facility was amended on November 15, 2013 to exclude the impact of the litigation charge, including the impact on our fixed charge coverage ratio. As of September 29, 2013, we were in compliance with each of these covenants, as amended.35Table of ContentsUnder our commercial paper program, as approved by our board of directors, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion, with individual maturities that may vary, but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facility. Currently, we may issue up to $729 million under our commercial paper program (the $750 million committed credit facility amount, less $21 million in outstanding letters of credit). The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. During fiscal 2013 and fiscal 2012, there were no borrowings under the credit facility or commercial paper programs. As of September 29, 2013 and September 30, 2012, a total of $21 million and $18 million, respectively, in letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility.In September 2013, we issued $750 million of 10-year 3.85% Senior Notes due in October 2023, in an underwritten registered public offering. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on April 1 and October 1 of each year, commencing April 1, 2014. As discussed further in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, during the third quarter of fiscal 2013 we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to these Senior Notes. We cash settled these swap agreements during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 at the time of the pricing of the $750 million in Senior Notes. The resulting net gains from these agreements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized as a reduction to interest expense on the consolidated statements of earnings over the life of these Senior Notes. The indentures under which our $550 million of 10-year 6.25% Senior Notes and our $750 million of 10-year 3.85% Senior Notes were issued also require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 29, 2013, we were in compliance with each of these covenants.Use of CashAs discussed further in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, the arbitration concluded for a commercial dispute relating to a distribution agreement we previously held with Kraft. As a result of the arbitration proceedings, Starbucks was ordered to pay Kraft $2.23 billion in damages plus prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees. We have estimated prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees to be approximately $557 million. We expect to fund our payment to Kraft through the use of available cash on hand in the US and anticipated additional issuance of debt. We expect to use additional available cash and short-term investments, including additional potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in our core businesses, including new product innovations and related marketing support, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses. We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and short-term investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future.We consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of September 29, 2013 to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no US income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the US to satisfy domestic liquidity needs; however, in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the US we would be subject to additional US income taxes, which could be material. We do not believe it is practical to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation, as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation, including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation, tax rates in effect, and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation.We may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding.Other than the expected payment to Kraft and normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2014 are expected to consist primarily of new company-operated stores; capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing company-operated stores; systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure; and additional investments in manufacturing capacity. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2014 are expected to be approximately $1.2 billion.36Table of ContentsDuring each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2012, we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.17 per share. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2013 we declared a cash dividend of $0.21 per share. Cash dividends paid in fiscal 2013 and 2012 totaled $629 million and $513 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, we declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share to be paid on November 29, 2013 with an expected payout of $196 million.During fiscal years 2013 and 2012, we repurchased 11 million and 12 million shares of common stock, respectively, or $544 million and $593 million, respectively, under share repurchase authorizations. The number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at September 29, 2013 totaled 26.4 million. Cash FlowsCash provided by operating activities was $2.9 billion for fiscal year 2013, compared to $1.8 billion for fiscal year 2012. The increase was primarily due to increased earnings, excluding the accrued litigation charge, and improvements in working capital accounts, primarily driven by a decrease in inventories and an increase in accounts payable.Cash used by investing activities totaled $1.4 billion for fiscal years 2013, compared to $974 million for fiscal year 2012. The increase was primarily due to cash paid to acquire Teavana and an increase in capital expenditures, primarily for remodeling and renovating existing company-operated stores and opening new retail stores, partially offset by a net increase in cash received from investment securities.Cash used by financing activities for fiscal year 2013 totaled $108 million, compared to $746 million for fiscal year 2012. The decrease was primarily due to the net cash proceeds from the fiscal 2013 issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by an increase in cash returned to shareholders through higher dividend payments in fiscal 2013.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 29, 2013, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations(1)Total Less than 1Year 1 - 3Years 3 - 5Years More than5 YearsOperating lease obligations(2)$4,585.9 $875.1 $1,490.2 $978.1 $1,242.5Purchase obligations(3)915.7 570.4 300.3 45.0 —Debt obligations(4)1,697.3 48.8 126.5 642.1 879.9Other obligations(5)2,837.6 2,787.7 6.0 6.4 37.5Total$10,036.5 $4,282.0 $1,923.0 $1,671.6 $2,159.9(1) Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.

Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 96% of total purchase obligations.(4) Debt amounts include principal maturities and scheduled interest payments on our long-term debt.(5) Other obligations include our estimated future payments associated with the accrued litigation charge and other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations, capital lease obligations and hedging instruments.Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements in this 10-K.37Table of ContentsCOMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONSCommodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. In general, hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years.The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.Commodity Price RiskWe purchase commodity inputs, including coffee, dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. In addition to fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 29, 2013 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying RateCommodity hedges$6 $(6) $— $—Foreign Currency Exchange RiskThe majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in US dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the US, we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, British pound, and euro. As a result, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues, inventory purchases, assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.As of September 29, 2013, we had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases. In addition, we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in Starbucks Japan to minimize foreign currency exposure.Starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes (free standing derivatives), but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables. Increases or decreases in the fair value of these derivatives are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the US dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables (i.e., “hedged items”) that would occur within the period.38Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 29, 2013 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the US dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates.

The trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). A corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of September 29, 2013 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.Interest Rate RiskDebt SecuritiesWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt. As of September 29, 2013 and September 30, 2012, we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding.The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of September 29, 2013 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): Change in Fair Value Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying Rate 6.25% Senior Notes $644 $(23) $233.85% Senior Notes$762 $(62) $62Available-for-Sale SecuritiesOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for-sale securities. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 29, 2013, and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESCritical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity:39Table of ContentsProperty, Plant and Equipment and Definite-Lived AssetsWhen facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of property plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable, we evaluate such assets for impairment. We first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we measure an impairment loss based on the asset’s estimated fair value. For retail assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on internal projections. Key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth, operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider a store’s historical performance, local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. These estimates are subjective and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions. For non-retail assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting asset useful lives. Further, our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess property plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible asset impairment loss. For the foreseeable future, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate such impairment losses. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if circumstances, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if the fair value of the reporting unit is not more likely than not greater than its carrying amount, we calculate the implied estimated fair value of the reporting unit. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value. The fair value of each of our reporting units is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. Key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth, operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering a reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital for a retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions.As a part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. As noted above, if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level, we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur.We evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trade names and trademarks) for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if an event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine if the fair value of the intangible asset group is more likely than not greater than its carrying amount. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment or if the fair value of the intangible asset group is not more likely than not greater than its carrying amount, we calculate the implied estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the 40Table of Contentsimplied estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. Key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth, the royalty rate that could hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the asset to an unrelated licensee and a discount rate that we believe reflects the level of risk associated with receiving the future cash flows attributable to the asset. Estimates of revenue growth are based on internal projections considering the intangible asset group's past performance and forecasted growth. The royalty rate used is based on observed market royalty rates for similar licensing arrangements adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions.Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions in the qualitative assessment of the reporting unit or intangible asset group and require management to apply judgment to estimate the reporting units or intangible asset group's fair value, including estimating future cash flows, and if necessary, the fair value of a reporting units’ assets and liabilities. Further, our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance, and changes in our business strategies. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess impairment loss. For fiscal 2013, we determined the fair value of our reporting units and intangible asset group's were substantially in excess of their carrying values. Accordingly, we did not recognize any goodwill impairments during the current fiscal year. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to test for impairment losses in the foreseeable future. However, as we periodically reassess our fair value calculations, including estimated future cash flows, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefits liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when new information becomes available.Income generated in certain foreign jurisdictions has not been subject to US income taxes. We intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. If these amounts were distributed to the US, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional US income taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits, and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.Litigation AccrualsWe are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. Legal and other contingency reserves and related disclosures are based on our assessment of the likelihood of a potential loss and our ability to estimate the loss or range of loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. We record reserves related to legal matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances and historical experience with similar claims, as necessary.41Table of ContentsOur disclosures of and accruals for litigation claims, if any, contain uncertainties because management is required to use judgment to estimate the probability of a loss and a range of possible losses related to each claim. Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K describes the Company’s legal and other contingent liability matters.As we periodically review our assessments of litigation accruals, we may change our assumptions with respect to loss probabilities and ranges of potential losses. Any changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. We do not expect these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods.Item 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Commodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Report.42Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:46:15.678833
829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2014,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGeneralOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal years ended on September 28, 2014, September 29, 2013 and September 30, 2012 all included 52 weeks. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.Financial Highlights•Total net revenues increased 11% to $16.4 billion in fiscal 2014 compared to $14.9 billion in fiscal 2013. •Global comparable store sales grew 6% driven by a 3% increase in the number of transactions and a 3% increase in average ticket.•Consolidated operating income increased to $3.1 billion in fiscal 2014 compared to an operating loss of $325.4 million in fiscal 2013. Fiscal 2014 operating margin was 18.7% compared to (2.2)% in fiscal 2013. The operating margin expansion was primarily due to lapping the $2.8 billion Kraft litigation charge in the prior year. The remaining change in operating margin was primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, mainly coffee.•Earnings per share for fiscal 2014 increased to $2.71, compared to EPS of $0.01 in fiscal 2013, primarily due to lapping the Kraft litigation charge, which reduced EPS by $2.25 per share in fiscal 2013. The remaining increase was primarily due to the improved sales leverage and lower commodity costs, as well as a gain on the sale of our equity interest in our Malaysia joint venture.•Cash flows from operations were $607.8 million in fiscal 2014 compared to $2.9 billion in fiscal 2013. The decline in fiscal 2014 was driven by the payment of $2.8 billion during the year for the Kraft arbitration matter. This was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $3.4 billion resulting from strong earnings and favorable changes in working capital accounts in the current year.•Capital expenditures were $1.2 billion in fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. •We returned $1.6 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2014 through dividends and share repurchases.OverviewStarbucks results for fiscal 2014 demonstrate the continued strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully execute new growth initiatives in a disciplined manner. All reportable segments contributed to strong revenue growth and collectively drove an increase in consolidated operating income and operating margin expansion. The Americas segment continued its strong performance in fiscal 2014, with revenues growing 9% to $12.0 billion, primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 6%, comprised of a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in number of transactions. Enhanced food offerings, including the full rollout of our La Boulange™ food platform in the US, the impact of price increases in our retail stores and successful promotional beverages contributed to the growth in comparable store sales. Americas operating margin grew 190 basis points to 23.4% in fiscal 2014, primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs. Looking forward, we expect to continue to drive revenue growth and margin expansion through new stores and continued product innovation, targeted at driving growth across all geographies and all dayparts. We plan to continue to expand our beverage platforms and elevate our food program, in part with continued enhancements to our lunch options.In the EMEA segment, fiscal 2014 benefited from the significant performance improvement of this segment, reaching double-digit revenue growth and increased profitability compared to the prior year. Revenues grew 12% to $1.3 billion, primarily driven by favorable foreign currency exchange and comparable store sales growth of 5%. Incremental revenues from 180 net new licensed store openings over the past year also contributed. EMEA operating margin expanded 370 basis points to 9.2% in fiscal 2014, primarily due to sales leverage and continued cost management, largely driven by the shift in our store portfolio to more licensed stores in this segment. We expect our continued disciplined licensed store expansion and focus on the customer experience in this region will result in improved operating performance as we progress on our plan towards mid-teens operating margin over time.Our China/Asia Pacific segment results reflect the growth and strong performance of new stores in the region, including 250 company-operated and 492 licensed net new store openings over the past year. This new store growth, along with a 7% increase in comparable store sales, drove a 23% increase in total net revenues to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2014. Operating income grew $51.3 million, or 16%, to $373 million compared to the prior year. Operating margin declined 200 basis points primarily resulting from the shift in the composition of our store portfolio in this segment to more company-operated stores. We expect this segment will become a more significant contributor to overall company profitability in the future. We look forward to continued new store openings and the acquisition and integration of Starbucks Japan, including expanding our presence into 22Table of Contentsother channels in the Japan market, such as CPG, licensing and foodservice. We also expect that China will continue to grow toward being one of our largest markets outside of the US. Channel Development segment revenues grew 11% to $1.5 billion, in fiscal 2014, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products. Lower coffee costs was the primary contributor to the 630 basis point increase in operating margin for fiscal 2014. As we continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores, including growing our presence in the premium single-serve category, we expect this segment to become a more significant contributor to future growth.Fiscal 2015 — The View AheadFor fiscal 2015, we expect revenue growth of 16% to 18%, including 6% to 7% of incremental growth from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan. The remaining growth will primarily come from mid-single-digit global comparable store sales growth and the addition of approximately 1,650 net new stores. Approximately one-half of net new store openings will be in our China/Asia Pacific segment, with the remaining half coming primarily from the Americas. We expect consolidated operating margin to decline slightly in fiscal 2015 when compared to our fiscal 2014 results, primarily due to the mildly dilutive margin impact of the acquisition of Starbucks Japan, largely driven by the change in business model from a joint venture to a company-operated market. We expect strong EPS growth in fiscal 2015, due in part to an anticipated acquisition-related gain of approximately $325 million to $375 million after-tax, or $0.43 to $0.49 per share, resulting from a fair value adjustment of our current 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan. We expect sales leverage to also contribute to the EPS growth. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 is expected to be approximately 31%, including a net tax benefit of approximately 4% from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan.Capital expenditures in fiscal 2015 are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, primarily for new stores and store renovations, as well as for other investments to support our ongoing growth initiatives.Acquisitions and DivestituresSee Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2014 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2013 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):RevenuesFiscal Year EndedSep 28, 2014 Sep 29, 2013 %ChangeNet revenues: Company-operated stores$12,977.9 $11,793.2 10.0%Licensed stores1,588.6 1,360.5 16.8CPG, foodservice and other1,881.3 1,713.1 9.8Total net revenues$16,447.8 $14,866.8 10.6%Total net revenues were $16.4 billion for fiscal 2014, an increase of $1.6 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2013, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.2 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by a 6% increase in comparable store sales (approximately $641 million) and incremental revenues from 555 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $529 million). Licensed store revenue growth contributed $228 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily due to increased product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees, as a result of improved comparable store sales and the opening of 1,029 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months.CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $168 million, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products (approximately $111 million) and increased foodservice sales (approximately $17 million).23Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 28, 2014 Sep 29, 2013 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 29, 2013 % of TotalNet RevenuesCost of sales including occupancy costs$6,858.8 $6,382.3 41.7 % 42.9 %Store operating expenses4,638.2 4,286.1 28.2 28.8Other operating expenses457.3 431.8 2.8 2.9Depreciation and amortization expenses709.6 621.4 4.3 4.2General and administrative expenses991.3 937.9 6.0 6.3Litigation charge(20.2) 2,784.1 (0.1) 18.7Total operating expenses13,635.0 15,443.6 82.9 103.9Income from equity investees268.3 251.4 1.6 1.7Operating income/(loss)$3,081.1 $(325.4) 18.7 % (2.2)%Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues 35.7 % 36.3 %Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 120 basis points, primarily driven by lower commodity costs (approximately 80 basis points), mainly coffee, and sales leverage (approximately 40 basis points).Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues, and as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, decreased 60 basis points, mainly driven by sales leverage (approximately 80 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 80 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage (approximately 30 basis points).General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 30 basis points, mainly due to lapping of costs associated with our leadership conference held in the prior year.The litigation charge of $2,784.1 million in fiscal 2013 reflects the charge we recorded as a result of the conclusion of the arbitration with Kraft. This charge included $2,227.5 million in damages and $556.6 million in estimated interest and attorneys' fees. The $20.2 million litigation credit recorded in fiscal 2014 reflects a reduction to our estimated prejudgment interest payable associated with the Kraft arbitration as a result of paying our obligation earlier than anticipated. Income from equity investees increased $17 million, primarily due to improved performance from our joint venture operations in China, South Korea, and Japan, as well as improved performance from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, which produces, bottles and distributes our ready-to-drink beverages.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin to 18.7% compared to (2.2)% in the prior year period.24Table of ContentsOther Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 28, 2014 Sep 29, 2013 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 29, 2013 % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income/(loss)$3,081.1 $(325.4) 18.7 % (2.2)%Interest income and other, net142.7 123.6 0.9 0.8Interest expense(64.1) (28.1) (0.4) (0.2)Earnings/(loss) before income taxes3,159.7 (229.9) 19.2 (1.5)Income taxes1,092.0 (238.7) 6.6 (1.6)Net earnings including noncontrolling interests2,067.7 8.8 12.6 0.1Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests(0.4) 0.5 — —Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$2,068.1 $8.3 12.6 % 0.1 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 34.6 % 103.8 %Net interest income and other increased $19 million over the prior year, primarily due to a net benefit from transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, driven by a gain on the sale of our equity interest in our Malaysia joint venture (approximately $68 million), favorable fair value adjustments from derivatives used to manage our risk of commodity price and foreign currency fluctuations (approximately $14 million), net favorable foreign exchange fluctuations (approximately $9 million), and realized gains on sales of investments (approximately $6 million). These increases were partially offset by lapping gains on the sales of our equity interests in our joint ventures in Chile and Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $45 million) and in Mexico in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $35 million). Interest expense increased $36 million due to interest on the long-term debt we issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 34.6% compared to 103.8% for fiscal 2013. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to lapping the 71.2% impact of the litigation charge associated with the Kraft arbitration in fiscal 2013. For additional information on the impact to our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate from the litigation charge, see Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. The remaining change in the effective tax rate over fiscal 2013 was an increase of 2.0%, which was primarily due to net higher discrete benefits in the prior year. In fiscal 2013, our effective tax rate benefited from releasing certain tax reserves that did not recur in fiscal 2014 and a net tax benefit from state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years. Also contributing to the increase in fiscal 2014 was additional tax resulting from the sale of our Australian company-operated retail store assets and operations and our 50% equity interest in our Malaysia joint venture.25Table of ContentsSegment InformationResults of operations by segment (in millions):AmericasFiscal Year EndedSep 28, 2014 Sep 29, 2013 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 29, 2013 As a % of Americas Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$10,866.5 $10,038.3 90.7% 91.3%Licensed stores1,074.9 915.4 9.0 8.3CPG, foodservice and other39.1 47.1 0.3 0.4Total net revenues11,980.5 11,000.8 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs4,487.0 4,214.9 37.5 38.3Store operating expenses3,946.8 3,710.2 32.9 33.7Other operating expenses100.4 96.9 0.8 0.9Depreciation and amortization expenses469.5 429.3 3.9 3.9General and administrative expenses167.8 186.7 1.4 1.7Total operating expenses9,171.5 8,638.0 76.6 78.5Income from equity investees— 2.4 — —Operating income$2,809.0 $2,365.2 23.4% 21.5%Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues 36.3% 37.0%RevenuesAmericas total net revenues for fiscal 2014 increased $980 million, or 9%, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $828 million) and licensed stores (contributing $160 million).The increase in company-operated store revenues was driven by a 6% increase in comparable store sales (approximately $554 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in number of transactions, and incremental revenues from 314 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $377 million). Partially offsetting these increases was unfavorable foreign currency exchange (approximately $65 million), primarily driven by the strengthening of the US dollar against the Canadian dollar.

General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points primarily due to the costs related to our October Global Leadership Conference (approximately 20 basis points).The combination of these changes resulted in an increase in operating margin of 120 basis points over fiscal 2012.33Table of ContentsEMEAFiscal Year EndedSep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 Sep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 As a % of EMEA Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$932.8 $968.3 80.4% 84.8%Licensed stores190.3 139.5 16.4 12.2CPG, foodservice and other36.9 33.5 3.2 2.9Total net revenues1,160.0 1,141.3 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs590.9 597.3 50.9 52.3Store operating expenses339.4 371.1 29.3 32.5Other operating expenses38.5 33.6 3.3 2.9Depreciation and amortization expenses55.5 57.1 4.8 5.0General and administrative expenses71.9 75.7 6.2 6.6Total operating expenses1,096.2 1,134.8 94.5 99.4Income from equity investees0.4 0.3 — —Operating income$64.2 $6.8 5.5% 0.6%Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues 36.4% 38.3%RevenuesEMEA total net revenues for fiscal 2013 increased $19 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2012. Licensed store revenues grew $51 million, or 36%, due to increased product sales to and higher royalty revenues from licensees, primarily from the opening of 129 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales. This growth was largely offset by a decline of $36 million in company-operated store revenues resulting from our store portfolio optimization activities which began in the prior year. Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 140 basis points, primarily due to lower occupancy costs resulting from our store portfolio optimization initiatives in Europe that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 (approximately 120 basis points) and a reduction to the estimated asset retirement obligations of our store leases in the region in fiscal 2013 (approximately 70 basis points). These improvements were partially offset by the impact of the shift in composition of our store portfolio in the region to more licensed stores, which have a lower gross margin.Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 320 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 190 basis points, primarily from our store portfolio optimization initiatives (approximately 120 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points. As a percentage of non-company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 250 basis points, mainly driven by sales leverage (approximately 180 basis points).The above changes contributed to an overall improvement in operating margin of 490 basis points over fiscal 2012. 34Table of ContentsChina/Asia PacificFiscal Year EndedSep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 Sep 29, 2013 Sep 30, 2012 As a % of CAP Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$671.7 $489.2 73.2% 67.8%Licensed stores245.3 232.2 26.8 32.2Total net revenues917.0 721.4 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs449.5 362.8 49.0 50.3Store operating expenses170.0 119.2 18.5 16.5Other operating expenses46.1 47.0 5.0 6.5Depreciation and amortization expenses33.8 23.2 3.7 3.2General and administrative expenses48.4 39.0 5.3 5.4Total operating expenses747.8 591.2 81.5 82.0Income from equity investees152.0 122.4 16.6 17.0Operating income$321.2 $252.6 35.0% 35.0%Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues 25.3% 24.4%RevenuesChina/Asia Pacific total net revenues for fiscal 2013 increased $196 million, or 27%, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $183 million), driven by the opening of 240 net new stores over the past 12 months (approximately $129 million) and a 9% increase in comparable store sales (approximately $43 million).

In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we paid $2.8 billion for the Kraft arbitration matter that was accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including government treasury securities (foreign and domestic), corporate bonds, mortgage and asset-backed securities, state and local government obligations, agency obligations and certificates of deposit. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, a significant portion of our offshore investment portfolio was liquidated in anticipation of funding the acquisition of Starbucks Japan, Ltd (""Starbucks Japan"") in fiscal 2015, discussed further in Note 18, Subsequent Event. As of September 28, 2014, approximately $1.4 billion of cash and investments were held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing capacityIn December 2013, we issued $400 million of 3-year 0.875% Senior Notes (""the 2016 notes"") due December 2016, and $350 million of 5-year 2.000% Senior Notes (""the 2018 notes"") due December 2018, in an underwritten registered public offering, to fund a portion of the payment required by the arbitration award in the Kraft litigation matter. Interest on the notes is payable semi-annually on June 5 and December 5 of each year, commencing on June 5, 2014. See Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.The indentures under which all of our Senior Notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 28, 2014, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants.Our $750 million unsecured, revolving credit facility with various banks, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases, and is currently set to mature on February 5, 2018. We may request, and the banks may grant, at their discretion, increases to the credit facility by a total additional amount of up to $750 million. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for US dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the 37Table of Contentsbetter of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies, and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the credit facility. The current applicable margin is 0.795% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.00% for Base Rate Loans. The credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 28, 2014, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of September 28, 2014.Under our commercial paper program, as approved by our Board of Directors, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion, with individual maturities that may vary, but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facility. Currently, we may issue up to $727 million under our commercial paper program (the $750 million committed credit facility amount, less $23 million in outstanding letters of credit). The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. In the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of $225 million to fund a portion of the $2.8 billion payment for the Kraft arbitration matter. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of $25 million to fund other corporate purposes. There were no other commercial paper borrowings during fiscal 2014 or fiscal 2013.Use of CashIn the first quarter of fiscal 2014, Starbucks paid all amounts due to Kraft under the arbitration, including prejudgment interest and attorneys' fees, and fully extinguished the litigation charge liability. Of the $2,784.1 million litigation charge accrued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013, $2,763.9 million was paid and the remainder was released as a litigation credit in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 to reflect a reduction to our estimated prejudgment interest payable as a result of paying our obligation earlier than anticipated.We expect to use additional available cash and investments, including additional potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in our core businesses, including new product innovations and related marketing support, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. As described further in Note 18, Subsequent Event, in September 2014, we entered into a tender offer bid agreement with Starbucks Japan and our joint venture partner, Sazaby League, Ltd., to acquire the remaining 60.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan for approximately $893 million, through a two-step tender offer. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we funded the first tender offer step with approximately $511 million in offshore cash. We also expect to fund a majority of the second tender offer step with offshore cash. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future.We consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of September 28, 2014 to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no US income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the US to satisfy domestic liquidity needs; however, in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the US, we would be subject to additional US income taxes, which could be material. We do not believe it is practicable to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation, as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation, including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation, tax rates in effect, and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation.Other than normal operating expenses and funding the acquisition of Starbucks Japan for approximately $893 million, cash requirements for fiscal 2015 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new company-operated stores; remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing company-operated stores; systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure; and additional investments in manufacturing capacity. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2015 are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion.During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2013, we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.21 per share. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2014 we declared a cash dividend of $0.26 per share. Cash dividends paid in fiscal 2014 and 2013 totaled $783.1 million and $628.9 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter 38Table of Contentsof fiscal 2014, we declared a cash dividend of $0.32 per share to be paid on November 28, 2014 with an expected payout of approximately $239.8 million.During fiscal years 2014 and 2013, we repurchased 10.5 million and 10.8 million shares of common stock, respectively, or $769.8 million and $544.1 million, respectively, under share repurchase authorizations. The number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at September 28, 2014 totaled 15.9 million. Cash FlowsCash provided by operating activities was $607.8 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $2.9 billion for fiscal 2013. The decrease was driven by the first quarter payment of $2.8 billion for the Kraft arbitration matter discussed above. This was partially offset by cash provided by operating activities of $3.4 billion primarily resulting from strong earnings and favorable changes in working capital accounts in the current year. Cash used by investing activities totaled $817.7 million for fiscal 2014, compared to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2013. The change was primarily due to cash paid to acquire Teavana in the prior year. Also contributing was an increase in our investments in long-term securities during fiscal 2014, more than offset by the subsequent liquidation of a significant portion of our offshore investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 in anticipation of funding the acquisition of Starbucks Japan.Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2014 totaled $623.3 million, compared to $108.2 million for fiscal 2013. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholders through share repurchases and higher dividend payments in fiscal 2014 and decreased proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the related excess tax benefits, resulting from fewer stock option exercises during the period.Contractual ObligationsOur contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 28, 2014, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (1)Total Less than 1Year 1 - 3Years 3 - 5Years More than5 YearsOperating lease obligations(2)$4,957.9 $925.6 $1,522.9 $1,007.1 $1,502.3Debt obligations Principal payments2,050.0 — 950.0 350.0 750.0Interest payments(3)417.7 73.8 145.8 68.2 129.9Purchase obligations(4)1,254.7 848.9 365.7 27.7 12.4Other obligations(5)55.1 2.7 5.6 5.3 41.5Total$8,735.4 $1,851.0 $2,990.0 $1,458.3 $2,436.1(1) Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.

Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 90% of total purchase obligations.(5) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations, capital lease obligations and hedging instruments. Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.39Table of ContentsCOMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONSCommodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole-bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. In general, hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of three years.The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.Commodity Price RiskWe purchase commodity inputs, including coffee, dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 28, 2014 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (""OCI"") from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying RateCommodity hedges$4 $(4) $3 $(3)Foreign Currency Exchange RiskThe majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in US dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the US, we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, British pound, and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated revenue streams and inventory purchases in currencies other than our functional currency, the US dollar, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, for further discussion.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 28, 2014 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (""OCI"") from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the US dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates.

Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings. Our trading securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (""MDCP""), which is included in accrued compensation and related costs, within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in our MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of September 28, 2014 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.Interest Rate RiskLong-term DebtWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to anticipated debt issuances. As of September 28, 2014, we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding.The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of September 28, 2014 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): Change in Fair Value Stated Interest Rate Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying Rate 2016 notes0.875% $400 $(9) $92017 notes6.250% $625 $(17) $172018 notes2.000% $353 $(14) $142023 notes3.850% $786 $(58) $58Available-for-Sale SecuritiesOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed-income instruments. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for-sale securities. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 28, 2014, and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESCritical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.41Table of ContentsProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Definite-Lived AssetsWe evaluate property, plant and equipment and other definite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. During fiscal 2014, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trade names and trademarks) for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group. Fair value is the price a market participant would pay for the reporting unit or intangible asset and is typically calculated using an income approach, such as a discounted cash flow or relief-from-royalty method. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. Our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, and the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments. During fiscal 2014, as part of our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we performed the qualitative assessment for approximately $104 million, or 12%, of our total goodwill balance of $856.2 million, the majority of which resides in our China retail, US licensed and US consumer packaged goods reporting units. As part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store, including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount when determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. If store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level, we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur.42Table of ContentsOur impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when performing a qualitative assessment or when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values typically include projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as selecting an appropriate discount rate. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, management also makes assumptions around the royalty rate that could hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the asset to an unrelated licensee. For a goodwill reporting unit, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, estimates of revenue growth are based on internal projections considering the intangible asset group's past performance and forecasted growth, and the royalty rate used is based on observed market royalty rates for similar licensing arrangements, adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective judgments and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance, and changes in our business strategies.For fiscal 2014, we determined the fair value of our material reporting units and intangible asset groups were significantly in excess of their carrying values. Accordingly, we did not recognize any material impairment charges during the current fiscal year. During fiscal 2014, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future; however, we do not expect changes from recently enacted tax laws to be material to the consolidated financial statements.In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when new information becomes available. There is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations; however, we do not expect this change to be material to the consolidated financial statements.We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that has not been subject to US income taxes. We intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the US to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the US, in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional US income taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits, and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the 43Table of Contentsjudgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. We do not expect any of these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Commodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions"" and ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Risk Management"" in Item 7 of this Report.44Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:46:17.621385
829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2015,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGeneralOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal years ended on September 27, 2015, September 28, 2014 and September 29, 2013 all included 52 weeks. Starbucks 2016 fiscal year will include 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in our fourth fiscal quarter. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.Financial Highlights•Total net revenues increased 17% to $19.2 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $16.4 billion in fiscal 2014. •Global comparable store sales grew 7% driven by a 4% increase in average ticket and a 3% increase in the number of transactions.•Consolidated operating income increased to $3.6 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to operating income of $3.1 billion in fiscal 2014. Fiscal 2015 operating margin was 18.8% compared to 18.7% in fiscal 2014. The operating margin expansion was primarily driven by sales leverage, partially offset by the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan and increased salaries and benefits due to increased store partner (employee) investments.•Earnings per share (""EPS"") for fiscal 2015 increased to $1.82, compared to EPS of $1.35 in fiscal 2014, primarily due to the gain resulting from the fair value adjustment of our preexisting equity interest in Starbucks Japan upon acquisition, which increased EPS by $0.26 per share in fiscal 2015. The remaining increase was primarily due to improved sales leverage and the incremental tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing deductions claimed for the current year and on U.S. corporate income tax returns for fiscal years 2010 through 2014.•Cash flows from operations were $3.7 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $607.8 million in fiscal 2014. The increase was primarily driven by lapping the prior year payment of $2.8 billion for the Kraft arbitration matter. The remaining change of $377 million was primarily due to strong earnings, partially offset by unfavorable changes in working capital accounts, mainly due to timing. •Capital expenditures were $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015 compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2014. •We returned $2.4 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2015 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2014.OverviewStarbucks results for fiscal 2015 demonstrate the continued strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners (employees). Our net revenues grew 17% over fiscal 2014 and all reportable segments drove an increase in consolidated operating income. Consolidated operating margin expanded to 18.8% from 18.7% in fiscal 2014, largely driven by sales leverage, partially offset by the 90 basis point impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan as well as increased salaries and benefits due to investments in our store partners (employees) in the Americas segment. The ownership change in Starbucks Japan reflects the change in accounting from a joint venture to a consolidated market and includes the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs. The Americas segment continued to perform well in fiscal 2015, with revenues growing 11% to $13.3 billion, primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 7%, comprised of a 4% increase in average ticket and a 3% increase in number of transactions, as well as incremental revenues from 612 net new store openings over the last 12 months. Growth in our core beverages, paired with the success of our food offerings and beverage innovation, drove the increase in comparable store sales. Americas operating margin grew 80 basis points to 24.2% in fiscal 2015, primarily driven by sales leverage, partially offset by increased salaries and benefits due to investments in our store partners (employees) and digital platforms related to in-store initiatives. Looking forward, we expect to continue to drive revenue growth and moderate margin expansion through new stores and leveraging investments in both our store partners (employees) and our digital platforms, such as Mobile Order and Pay.Our fiscal 2015 China/Asia Pacific segment results reflect the impact of fully consolidating Starbucks Japan since October 31, 2014. Incremental revenues from the change in ownership of Starbucks Japan were the primary driver of the 112% increase in segment revenues, to $2.4 billion. Also contributing were increased sales from the opening of 767 net new stores over the past year, along with a 9% increase in comparable store sales, primarily driven by an 8% increase in transactions. Operating income grew 34%, to $501 million, while operating margin declined 1,210 basis points to 20.9%. The overall operating margin decline was due to the 1,410 basis point impact of the ownership change in Starbucks Japan, which was partially offset by 200 basis points of expansion primarily due to sales leverage. We expect this segment will become a more significant contributor to overall company revenue growth in the future as we look forward to continued net new store openings and the first full year of 22Table of Contentsconsolidating Starbucks Japan. In fiscal 2016, we also expect China to continue to move towards being one of our largest international markets, primarily driven by expanding our retail store presence and increasing transaction growth.Our EMEA segment revenues declined 6% to $1.2 billion, primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation of approximately $116 million. This was partially offset by revenue growth of $38 million that was primarily driven by incremental revenues from 238 net new licensed store openings over the past year. EMEA operating margin expanded 460 basis points to 13.8% in fiscal 2015, primarily due to sales leverage driven by our ongoing portfolio shift to higher-margin licensed stores. We expect our continued disciplined licensed store expansion and focus on the customer experience in this region will result in improved operating performance, with operating margin approaching 15% in fiscal 2016. The Channel Development segment revenues grew 12% to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products, driven by sales of Starbucks- and Tazo-branded K-Cup® portion packs, and improved packaged coffee sales. Operating margin increased 180 basis points to 37.8%, primarily driven by leverage on cost of sales and increased income due to strong performance by our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture. We continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores and through our developing international presence. For fiscal 2016, we expect moderate margin expansion primarily driven by growing our premium single-serve category with innovative new beverages, including the ready-to-drink market. Fiscal 2016 — The View AheadFor fiscal 2016, we expect revenue growth in excess of 10%, driven by strong comparable store sales slightly above the mid-single digits, the addition of approximately 1,800 net new stores, and a 53rd fiscal week, which is expected to contribute an incremental 2% to our revenue growth rate. Approximately one-half of net new store openings will be in our China/Asia Pacific segment, with approximately 40% coming from the Americas and the remaining 10% from the EMEA segment. We expect consolidated operating margin and earnings per share to increase slightly in fiscal 2016 when compared to our fiscal 2015 results, primarily due to leverage on revenue growth and a 53rd fiscal week, which we expect to contribute approximately $0.06 to earnings per share, partially offset by continued investments in our store partners (employees) in the Americas segment and the development of these initiatives in our international markets, as well as digital innovation.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 is expected to be between 34% to 35%.Capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion, primarily for new stores and store renovations, as well as for other investments to support our ongoing growth initiatives.Acquisitions and DivestituresSee Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2015 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2014 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):RevenuesFiscal Year EndedSep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 %ChangeNet revenues: Company-operated stores$15,197.3 $12,977.9 17.1%Licensed stores1,861.9 1,588.6 17.2CPG, foodservice and other2,103.5 1,881.3 11.8Total net revenues$19,162.7 $16,447.8 16.5%Total net revenues increased $2.7 billion, or 17%, over fiscal 2014, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $2.2 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by incremental revenues from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan (approximately $1.1 billion), an increase in comparable store sales (approximately 7% growth, or $852 million) and incremental revenues from 550 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $590 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation (approximately $252 million). 23Table of ContentsLicensed store revenue growth also contributed $273 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily resulting from the opening of 1,075 net new Starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales as well as increased La Boulange food sales to our licensees in the Americas segment. Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in licensed store revenues resulting from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately $45 million).CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $222 million, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products (approximately $116 million), U.S. packaged coffee (approximately $55 million) and foodservice sales (approximately $40 million).Operating ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 % of TotalNet RevenuesCost of sales including occupancy costs$7,787.5 $6,858.8 40.6% 41.7 %Store operating expenses5,411.1 4,638.2 28.2 28.2Other operating expenses522.4 457.3 2.7 2.8Depreciation and amortization expenses893.9 709.6 4.7 4.3General and administrative expenses1,196.7 991.3 6.2 6.0Litigation credit— (20.2) — (0.1)Total operating expenses15,811.6 13,635.0 82.5 82.9Income from equity investees249.9 268.3 1.3 1.6Operating income$3,601.0 $3,081.1 18.8% 18.7 %Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 35.6% 35.7 %Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 110 basis points, primarily driven by sales and operating leverage on cost of sales (approximately 60 basis points), driven by strong sales and initiatives in our supply chain, such as improvements in sourcing, as well as sales leverage on occupancy costs (approximately 40 basis points).Store operating expenses were flat as a percentage of total net revenues. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, decreased 10 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage (approximately 50 basis points) and decreased expenses, largely salaries and benefits, due to the shift to more licensed stores in EMEA (approximately 40 basis points), partially offset by increased investments in store partners (employees) and digital platforms related to in-store initiatives (approximately 100 basis points) in the Americas segment.Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses were flat, primarily due to sales leverage (approximately 70 basis points), partially offset by increased marketing (approximately 20 basis points), largely due to timing, the impairment of certain assets in the Americas segment (approximately 20 basis points) and the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 20 basis points).Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 30 basis points).General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 10 basis points). The $20 million decrease in litigation credit for fiscal 2015 was due to lapping a prior year credit related to a reduction of our estimated prejudgment interest payable associated with the Kraft arbitration, as a result of paying our obligation earlier than anticipated. Income from equity investees decreased $18 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan and the absence of income from our Malaysia joint venture sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by improved performance from our North American Coffee Partnership and China joint ventures. As a percentage of total revenues, income from equity investees decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 30 basis points).The overall increase in operating margin of 10 basis points was driven by the changes discussed above, including the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan and the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, which contributed unfavorably to operating margin (approximately 90 basis points).24Table of ContentsOther Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income$3,601.0 $3,081.1 18.8 % 18.7 %Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture390.6 — 2.0 —Loss on extinguishment of debt(61.1) — (0.3) —Interest income and other, net43.0 142.7 0.2 0.9Interest expense(70.5) (64.1) (0.4) (0.4)Earnings before income taxes3,903.0 3,159.7 20.4 19.2Income taxes1,143.7 1,092.0 6.0 6.6Net earnings including noncontrolling interests2,759.3 2,067.7 14.4 12.6Net earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests1.9 (0.4) — —Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$2,757.4 $2,068.1 14.4 % 12.6 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 29.3 % 34.6 %During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a gain of $391 million as a result of remeasuring our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan to fair value upon acquisition.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a loss of $61 million related to the redemption of our $550 million of 6.250% Senior Notes (the ""2017 notes""), which were originally scheduled to mature in August 2017. The loss primarily relates to the optional redemption premium outlined in the 2017 notes indenture, as well as expenses related to the previously capitalized original issuance costs and accelerated amortization of the unamortized discount.Net interest income and other decreased $100 million, primarily due to lapping the gain on the sale of our equity interest in our Malaysia joint venture (approximately $68 million) in the prior year and net unfavorable fair value adjustments from derivative instruments used to manage our risk of commodity price fluctuations (approximately $25 million) in fiscal 2015.Interest expense increased $6 million primarily due to incurring a full quarter of interest in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 on the long-term debt we issued in December of fiscal 2014 as well as the reclassification of $2 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense related to remaining unrecognized losses from interest rate contracts associated with the 2017 notes redeemed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 29.3% compared to 34.6% for fiscal 2014. The decrease in the rate for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the 3.7% impact of the gain associated with the remeasurement of our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan upon acquisition, which was almost entirely non-taxable, as well as the 1.5% incremental tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing deductions claimed in fiscal 2015 on U.S. corporate income tax returns for fiscal years 2010 through 2015.25Table of ContentsSegment InformationResults of operations by segment (in millions):AmericasFiscal Year EndedSep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 As a % of Americas Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$11,925.6 $10,866.5 89.7% 90.7%Licensed stores1,334.4 1,074.9 10.0 9.0Foodservice and other33.4 39.1 0.3 0.3Total net revenues13,293.4 11,980.5 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs4,845.0 4,487.0 36.4 37.5Store operating expenses4,387.9 3,946.8 33.0 32.9Other operating expenses122.8 100.4 0.9 0.8Depreciation and amortization expenses522.3 469.5 3.9 3.9General and administrative expenses192.1 167.8 1.4 1.4Total operating expenses10,070.1 9,171.5 75.8 76.6Operating income$3,223.3 $2,809.0 24.2% 23.4%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 36.8% 36.3%RevenuesAmericas total net revenues for fiscal 2015 increased $1.3 billion, or 11%, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.1 billion) and licensed stores (contributing $260 million).The increase in company-operated store revenues was driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales (approximately $745 million), as well as incremental revenues from 318 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $455 million). Partially offsetting these increases was unfavorable foreign currency translation (approximately $139 million), primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar. The increase in licensed store revenues was primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees, resulting from increased La Boulange™ food sales to our licensees beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, as well as the opening of 317 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales.Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 110 basis points, primarily driven by leverage on cost of sales (approximately 60 basis points), lower commodity costs (approximately 30 basis points), mainly dairy, and sales leverage on occupancy costs (approximately 30 basis points).Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 10 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses increased 50 basis points, primarily driven by increased investments in store partners (employees) and digital platforms related to in-store initiatives (approximately 130 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage (approximately 100 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses were flat, primarily driven by sales leverage (approximately 60 basis points), offset by the impairment of certain assets in the region (approximately 60 basis points).Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total revenues were flat, primarily driven by sales leverage (approximately 10 basis points), offset by incremental costs from investments in our existing store portfolio (approximately 10 basis points).The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 80 basis points over fiscal 2014.26Table of ContentsChina/Asia PacificFiscal Year EndedSep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 As a % of China/Asia Pacific Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$2,127.3 $859.4 88.8% 76.1%Licensed stores264.4 270.2 11.0 23.9Foodservice and other4.2 — 0.2 —Total net revenues2,395.9 1,129.6 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs1,071.5 547.4 44.7 48.5Store operating expenses609.8 221.1 25.5 19.6Other operating expenses62.2 48.0 2.6 4.2Depreciation and amortization expenses150.7 46.1 6.3 4.1General and administrative expenses120.8 58.5 5.0 5.2Total operating expenses2,015.0 921.1 84.1 81.5Income from equity investees119.6 164.0 5.0 14.5Operating income$500.5 $372.5 20.9% 33.0%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 28.7% 25.7%Discussion of our China/Asia Pacific segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating Starbucks Japan due to the ownership change from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of October 31, 2014. Under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product cost of sales as well as our proportionate share of Starbucks Japan's net earnings, which we recognized within income from equity investees. This resulted in a lower gross margin and a very high operating margin. Under the company-operated ownership model, Starbucks Japan's operating results are reflected in most income statement lines of this segment and have an operating margin more in line with that of our other retail businesses.RevenuesChina/Asia Pacific total net revenues for fiscal 2015 increased $1.3 billion, or 112%, largely due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (approximately $1.3 billion). The increase in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by incremental revenues from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan (approximately $1.1 billion). Also contributing were incremental revenues from the opening of 247 net new company-operated stores over the past 12 months (approximately $160 million) and a 9% increase in comparable store sales (approximately $74 million).Licensed store revenues decreased $6 million, primarily due to our ownership change in Starbucks Japan to mostly company-operated stores (approximately $45 million). This decrease was partially offset by increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees (approximately $27 million), resulting from the opening of 520 net new licensed store openings over the past 12 months, improved comparable store sales, and incremental revenues from the ownership changes in Australia and Malaysia (approximately $17 million) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 380 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 230 basis points) and the shift in our cost of sales mix resulting from growth of company-operated stores, which have a higher gross margin (approximately 50 basis points). Sales leverage (approximately 40 basis points) also contributed.Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 590 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses increased 300 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 410 basis points), partially offset by the sale of our Australia retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 (approximately 70 basis points) and sales leverage (approximately 50 basis points). Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 160 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses increased 540 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 350 basis points) as well as increased salaries and benefits largely due to increased headcount to support growth in our China market (approximately 150 basis points). 27Table of ContentsDepreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 220 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 210 basis points).General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage (approximately 40 basis points) and the impact of the sale of our Australia retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 (approximately 20 basis points), which includes lapping professional fees associated with the sale. The impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan contributed unfavorably (approximately 60 basis points).Income from equity investees decreased $44 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan and absence of income from our Malaysia joint venture sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by improved performance from our China joint venture. As a percentage of total net revenues, income from equity investees declined 950 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 870 basis points).The overall decrease in operating margin of 1,210 basis points over fiscal 2014 was primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 1,410 basis points), partially offset by 200 basis points of margin expansion driven by the other items discussed above.EMEAFiscal Year EndedSep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 As a % of EMEA Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$911.2 $1,013.8 74.9% 78.3%Licensed stores257.2 238.4 21.1 18.4Foodservice48.3 42.6 4.0 3.3Total net revenues1,216.7 1,294.8 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs582.5 646.8 47.9 50.0Store operating expenses308.7 365.8 25.4 28.3Other operating expenses51.8 48.2 4.3 3.7Depreciation and amortization expenses52.0 59.4 4.3 4.6General and administrative expenses56.6 59.1 4.7 4.6Total operating expenses1,051.6 1,179.3 86.4 91.1Income from equity investees3.1 3.7 0.3 0.3Operating income$168.2 $119.2 13.8% 9.2%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 33.9% 36.1%RevenuesEMEA total net revenues for fiscal 2015 decreased $78 million, or 6%. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in company-operated store revenues (approximately $103 million), which was largely due to unfavorable foreign currency translation (approximately $94 million). Also contributing to the decrease in company-operated revenues was the shift to more licensed stores in the region, which includes net store closures as well as the absence of revenues from the conversion of certain stores in the U.K. from company-operated to licensed. This decline was partially offset by 4% growth in comparable store sales.Licensed store revenues increased $19 million, or 8%, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees (approximately $45 million), resulting from the opening of 238 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation (approximately $22 million).Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 210 basis points, primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange (approximately 130 basis points). We buy and sell products, primarily roasted coffee, in multiple currencies throughout the region depending on the functional currency of each market. Differences in those rates generated favorable foreign currency exchange for fiscal 2015 resulting in a benefit in cost of sales. Sales leverage(approximately 40 basis points) also contributed to the decrease.28Table of ContentsStore operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 290 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 220 basis points primarily due to gains on the sales of certain store assets in the region (approximately 150 basis points) as well as decreased expenses, largely salaries and benefits, driven by the shift to more licensed stores (approximately 40 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 60 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 20 basis points, primarily driven by the gain on the sale of certain assets in the region (approximately 40 basis points) and improved collection results (approximately 20 basis points). These decreases were partially offset by increased costs to grow our non-retail operations in the region (approximately 50 basis points), largely driven by higher marketing costs.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 460 basis points over fiscal 2014.

This increase was partially offset by lower professional fees (approximately 30 basis points) and sales leverage (approximately 20 basis points). Income from equity investees increased $27 million, driven by higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, primarily due to increased sales of bottled Frappuccino® and Starbucks Doubleshot® beverages, largely driven by new product launches and higher sales volumes.

This charge included $2,227.5 million in damages and $556.6 million in estimated interest and attorneys' fees. The $20.2 million litigation credit recorded in fiscal 2014 reflects a reduction to our estimated prejudgment interest payable associated with the Kraft arbitration as a result of paying our obligation earlier than anticipated. Income from equity investees increased $17 million, primarily due to improved performance from our joint venture operations in China, South Korea, and Japan, as well as improved performance from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, which produces, bottles and distributes our ready-to-drink beverages.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin to 18.7% compared to (2.2)% in the prior year period.31Table of ContentsOther Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 28, 2014 Sep 29, 2013 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 29, 2013 % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income/(loss)$3,081.1 $(325.4) 18.7 % (2.2)%Interest income and other, net142.7 123.6 0.9 0.8Interest expense(64.1) (28.1) (0.4) (0.2)Earnings/(loss) before income taxes3,159.7 (229.9) 19.2 (1.5)Income taxes1,092.0 (238.7) 6.6 (1.6)Net earnings including noncontrolling interests2,067.7 8.8 12.6 0.1Net earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests(0.4) 0.5 — —Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$2,068.1 $8.3 12.6 % 0.1 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 34.6 % 103.8 %Net interest income and other increased $19 million over the prior year, primarily due to a net benefit from transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, driven by a gain on the sale of our equity interest in our Malaysia joint venture (approximately $68 million), favorable fair value adjustments from derivatives used to manage our risk of commodity price and foreign currency fluctuations (approximately $14 million), net favorable foreign exchange fluctuations (approximately $9 million), and realized gains on sales of investments (approximately $6 million). These increases were partially offset by lapping gains on the sales of our equity interests in our joint ventures in Chile and Argentina in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $45 million) and in Mexico in the second quarter of fiscal 2013 (approximately $35 million). Interest expense increased $36 million due to interest on the long-term debt we issued in the first quarter of fiscal 2014 and the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013.Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2014 was 34.6% compared to 103.8% for fiscal 2013. The change in our effective tax rate was primarily due to lapping the 71.2% impact of the litigation charge associated with the Kraft arbitration in fiscal 2013. For additional information on the impact to our fiscal 2013 effective tax rate from the litigation charge, see Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. The remaining change in the effective tax rate over fiscal 2013 was an increase of 2.0%, which was primarily due to net higher discrete benefits in the prior year. In fiscal 2013, our effective tax rate benefited from releasing certain tax reserves that did not recur in fiscal 2014 and a net tax benefit from state income tax expense adjustments for returns filed in prior years. Also contributing to the increase in fiscal 2014 was additional tax resulting from the sale of our Australian company-operated retail store assets and operations and our 50% equity interest in our Malaysia joint venture.32Table of ContentsSegment InformationResults of operations by segment (in millions):AmericasFiscal Year EndedSep 28, 2014 Sep 29, 2013 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 29, 2013 As a % of Americas TotalNet RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$10,866.5 $10,038.3 90.7% 91.3%Licensed stores1,074.9 915.4 9.0 8.3Foodservice and other39.1 47.1 0.3 0.4Total net revenues11,980.5 11,000.8 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs4,487.0 4,214.9 37.5 38.3Store operating expenses3,946.8 3,710.2 32.9 33.7Other operating expenses100.4 96.9 0.8 0.9Depreciation and amortization expenses469.5 429.3 3.9 3.9General and administrative expenses167.8 186.7 1.4 1.7Total operating expenses9,171.5 8,638.0 76.6 78.5Income from equity investees— 2.4 — —Operating income$2,809.0 $2,365.2 23.4% 21.5%Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues 36.3% 37.0%RevenuesAmericas total net revenues for fiscal 2014 increased $980 million, or 9%, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $828 million) and licensed stores (contributing $160 million).The increase in company-operated store revenues was driven by a 6% increase in comparable store sales (approximately $554 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in number of transactions, and incremental revenues from 314 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months (approximately $377 million).

We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (foreign and domestic), mortgage and asset-backed securities, state and local government obligations and agency obligations. As of September 27, 2015, approximately $1.0 billion of cash and investments were held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing capacityOur $750 million unsecured, revolving credit facility (the ""2013 credit facility"") with various banks, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. During the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we extended the duration of our credit facility, which is now set to mature on January 21, 2020, and amended certain facility fees and borrowing rates. Starbucks has the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $750 million. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the credit facility. The current applicable margin is 0.565% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.00% for Base Rate Loans. The credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 27, 2015, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of September 27, 2015. During the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we replaced the 2013 credit facility with a new $1.5 billion unsecured, revolving credit facility (the ""2016 credit facility"") with various banks, which is now set to mature on November 6, 2020. The terms and conditions of the 2016 credit facility are substantially consistent with those of the 2013 credit facility.Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. 37Table of ContentsAmounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facility discussed above. As of September 27, 2015, availability under our commercial paper program was approximately $750 million (which represents the full committed credit facility amount, as the amount of outstanding letters of credit was not material as of September 27, 2015). The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including share repurchases, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock or the financing of possible acquisitions. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we issued and subsequently repaid commercial paper borrowings of $93 million for general corporate purposes. We had no other borrowings under our commercial paper program during fiscal 2015.In June 2015, we issued additional long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 7-year 2.700% Senior Notes (the ""2022 notes"") due June 2022, and $350 million of 30-year 4.300% Senior Notes (the ""2045 notes"") due June 2045. Interest on the 2022 notes and the 2045 notes is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2015. See Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.As discussed in Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, during the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to the 2022 notes. During the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to the 2045 notes. The swap agreements were cash settled in the third quarter of fiscal 2015 at the time the 2022 notes and the 2045 notes were priced. The resulting net losses from these agreements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income and will be amortized as an increase to interest expense on the consolidated statements of net earnings over the lives of the 2022 notes and the 2045 notes. In July 2015, we redeemed our $550 million of 6.250% Senior Notes (the ""2017 notes"") that were originally scheduled to mature in August 2017. See Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt. We continually evaluate liquidity and funding needs and anticipate issuing long-term debt in fiscal 2016 to provide us with financial flexibility. As discussed further in Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we entered into forward-starting interest rate swap agreements to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to this anticipated debt issuance. The indentures under which all of our Senior Notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 27, 2015, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. See Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt. Use of CashWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including additional potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures, new product innovations, related marketing support and partner investments, return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future.As described in Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, in September 2014, we entered into a tender offer bid agreement with Starbucks Japan and our former joint venture partner, Sazaby League, Ltd., to acquire the remaining 60.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan for approximately $876 million, through a two-step tender offer. In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we funded the first tender offer step with $509 million in offshore cash. We funded the second tender offer step in the second quarter of fiscal 2015 and the related cash-out procedure during the remainder of fiscal 2015, which required a combined total of $362 million in offshore cash. The remaining $6 million of the purchase price represents cash that was unclaimed by minority shareholders as of September 27, 38Table of Contents2015 and is recorded in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. There are no legal restrictions on the remaining unclaimed balance.We consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of September 27, 2015 to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs; however, in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the U.S., we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, which could be material. We do not believe it is practicable to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation, as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation, including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation, tax rates in effect, and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation.During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2014, we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.13 per share. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2015 we declared a cash dividend of $0.16 per share. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2015 and 2014 totaled $958.7 million and $783.1 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share to be paid on November 27, 2015 with an expected payout of approximately $297.0 million.During fiscal years 2015 and 2014, we repurchased 29.0 million and 21.0 million shares of common stock, respectively, or $1.4 billion and $769.8 million, respectively, under share repurchase authorizations. On July 23, 2015, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase of 50 million shares to our ongoing share repurchase program. The number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at September 27, 2015 totaled 52.7 million. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2016 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new company-operated stores; remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing company-operated stores; systems and technology investments in our stores and in the support infrastructure; and additional investments in manufacturing capacity. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2016 are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion.Cash FlowsCash provided by operating activities was $3.7 billion for fiscal 2015, compared to $607.8 million for fiscal 2014. The increase was driven by lapping the prior year payment of $2.8 billion for the Kraft arbitration matter. The remaining change of $377 million was primarily due to increased earnings, partially offset by changes in working capital accounts mainly due to timing.Cash used by investing activities totaled $1.5 billion for fiscal 2015, compared to $817.7 million for fiscal 2014. The change was primarily due to the use of cash to acquire Sazaby's 39.5% ownership interest in Japan in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, as well as lapping the liquidation of a significant portion of our offshore investment portfolio in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 in order to fund the acquisition of Starbucks Japan. Additions to property, plant and equipment also contributed, driven by increased store renovations and additions for new store openings. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2015 totaled $2.3 billion, compared to $623.3 million for fiscal 2014. The change was primarily due to increased cash returned to shareholders through higher share repurchases and dividend payments compared to fiscal 2014 and cash used to redeem our 2017 notes, as discussed above, as well as cash used to fund the second tender offer step and the cash-out procedure of the Starbucks Japan acquisition in fiscal 2015. These changes were partially offset by incremental proceeds from the long-term debt we issued in June of fiscal 2015 over the prior year's issuance. 39Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 27, 2015, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (1)Total Less than 1Year 1 - 3Years 3 - 5Years More than5 YearsOperating lease obligations(2)$5,669.5 $1,032.4 $1,632.3 $1,172.9 $1,831.9Financing lease obligations(3)47.1 3.2 6.4 6.4 31.1Debt obligations Principal payments2,350.0 — 400.0 350.0 1,600.0Interest payments(4)821.2 67.9 130.6 118.4 504.3Purchase obligations(5)1,257.1 884.0 284.7 76.0 12.4Other obligations(6)122.7 19.2 28.3 13.0 62.2Total$10,267.6 $2,006.7 $2,482.3 $1,736.7 $4,041.9(1) Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. As of September 27, 2015, we had $159.3 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, which includes accrued interest and penalties.(2) Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses.(3) Amounts consist of build-to-suit lease arrangements primarily related to the Starbucks Japan acquisition, which are described further in Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. (4) Amounts exclude any gain or loss upon settlement of related interest rate swap agreements, which are described further in Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.(5) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 86% of total purchase obligations.(6) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations and hedging instruments. Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONSCommodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. In general, hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to 40Table of ContentsNote 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.Commodity Price RiskWe purchase commodity inputs, including coffee, dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 27, 2015 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (""OCI"") from changes in commodity prices.

However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 27, 2015 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (""OCI"") from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates.

Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings. Our trading securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (""MDCP""), which is included in accrued compensation and related costs, within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in our MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of September 27, 2015 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.41Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskLong-term DebtWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of September 27, 2015.The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of September 27, 2015 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): Change in Fair Value Stated Interest Rate Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying Rate 2016 notes0.875% $400 $(5) $52018 notes2.000% $354 $(11) $112022 notes2.700% $503 $(31) $312023 notes3.850% $790 $(54) $542045 notes4.300% $355 $(61) $61Available-for-Sale SecuritiesOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed-income instruments. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for-sale securities. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 27, 2015, and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESCritical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived AssetsWe evaluate property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.42Table of ContentsOur impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. During fiscal 2015, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (primarily trade names and trademarks) for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group. Fair value is the price a market participant would pay for the reporting unit or intangible asset and is typically calculated using an income approach, such as a discounted cash flow or relief-from-royalty method. For certain reporting units, where deemed appropriate, we may also utilize a market approach. Under the market approach, fair value is estimated by reviewing prices in market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities with a similar risk profile. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. Our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. During fiscal 2015, as part of our annual goodwill impairment analysis, we performed the qualitative assessment for approximately $941 million, or 60%, of our total goodwill balance of $1.6 billion, the majority of which resides in our Japan retail, U.S. company-operated and Canada company-operated reporting units. Our Japan retail reporting unit, which was acquired in fiscal 2015, represented approximately $730 million of the goodwill balance that was assessed qualitatively.As part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store, including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, the associated goodwill is included in the carrying amount when determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. If store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level, we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur.Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when performing a qualitative assessment or when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values typically include projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as selecting an appropriate discount rate. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, management also makes assumptions around the royalty rate that could hypothetically be charged by a licensor of the asset to an unrelated licensee. For a goodwill reporting unit, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. For indefinite-lived intangible assets, estimates of revenue growth are based on internal projections considering the intangible asset group's past performance and forecasted growth, and the royalty rate used is based on observed market royalty rates for similar licensing arrangements, adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is 43Table of Contentsselected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective judgments and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance, and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.For fiscal 2015, we determined the fair value of our material reporting units and intangible asset groups were significantly in excess of their carrying values. Accordingly, we did not recognize any material impairment charges during the current fiscal year. During fiscal 2015, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future; however, we do not expect changes from recently enacted tax laws to be material to the consolidated financial statements.In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and expected consent from taxing authorities.We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that has not been subject to U.S. income taxes. We intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits, and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. 44Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Commodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions"" and ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Risk Management"" in Item 7 of this Report.45Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:46:19.932464
829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2016,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGeneralOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal year ended on October 2, 2016 included 53 weeks, with the extra week falling in our fourth fiscal quarter. Fiscal years ended on September 27, 2015 and September 28, 2014 both included 52 weeks. Comparable store sales percentages below are calculated excluding the 53rd week. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.Financial Highlights•Total net revenues increased 11% to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $19.2 billion in fiscal 2015. •Global comparable store sales grew 5% driven by a 4% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in the number of transactions.•Consolidated operating income increased to $4.2 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to operating income of $3.6 billion in fiscal 2015. Fiscal 2016 operating margin was 19.6% compared to 18.8% in fiscal 2015. Operating margin expansion in fiscal 2016 was primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in partners (employees) and digital platforms.•Earnings per share (""EPS"") for fiscal 2016 increased to $1.90 and included $0.06 per share for the extra week in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2015 EPS was $1.82 and included $0.26 per share from the gain on the fair value adjustment of our preexisting equity interest in Starbucks Japan upon acquisition.•Cash flows from operations were $4.6 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $3.7 billion in fiscal 2015. The change was primarily due to increased earnings, the lapping of the non-cash acquisition related gain for Starbucks Japan and the timing of our cash payments for income taxes.•Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2015. •We returned $3.2 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2016 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $2.4 billion in fiscal 2015.OverviewStarbucks results for fiscal 2016 continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model, and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners (employees). Our net revenues grew 11% over fiscal 2015, and consolidated operating margin expanded 80 basis points from 18.8% in fiscal 2015 to 19.6% in fiscal 2016, largely driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in our partners and digital platforms. The Americas segment continued to perform well in fiscal 2016, with revenues growing 11% to $14.8 billion, primarily driven by comparable store sales growth of 6%, comprised of a 5% increase in average ticket and a 1% increase in number of transactions, incremental revenues from 804 net new store openings over the last 12 months and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. Growth in our iced beverages, including coffee, tea and espresso, paired with beverage innovation and the success of our food offerings, drove the increase in comparable store sales. Americas operating margin grew 110 basis points to 25.3% in fiscal 2016, primarily driven by sales leverage and lower commodity costs, partially offset by investments in our store partners and digital platforms. Our fiscal 2016 China/Asia Pacific segment results reflected higher revenues from the opening of 981 net new stores over the past year, incremental revenues associated with the ownership change in Starbucks Japan, a 3% increase in comparable store sales and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. Operating margin expanded 60 basis points to 21.5%, driven by sales leverage, higher income from our joint venture operations and favorability from changes to certain business tax structures in China. This favorability was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation and the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan. We now operate 6,443 stores in 15 countries in our China/Asia Pacific segment with continued strong performance, reinforcing our confidence in the long-term growth potential of this market.As we continue to execute our strategy of achieving the appropriate balance between company-operated and licensed stores, our EMEA segment revenues declined 8% to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2016 compared to a year ago. The decline in revenues was primarily driven by lower company-operated store revenues due to the shift to more licensed stores in the region and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting lower company-operated store revenues were higher licensed store sales, primarily resulting from the opening of 294 net new licensed stores and the transfer of 200 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months, and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016. Compared to fiscal 2015, EMEA operating margin declined 30 basis points to 13.5% primarily due to sales deleverage at certain company-operated stores and 22Table of Contentsunfavorable foreign currency exchange, partially offset by sales leverage driven by the shift in the portfolio towards more licensed stores.The Channel Development segment revenues grew 12% to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2016, primarily due to higher sales of premium single-serve products, driven by sales of Starbucks® K-Cup® portion packs, the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 and increased foodservice and packaged coffee sales. Operating margin increased 400 basis points to 41.8%, primarily driven by strong performance from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, lower coffee costs and leverage on cost of sales. As seen through our Channel Development segment results for fiscal 2016, we continue to expand customer occasions outside of our retail stores and through our developing international presence.Fiscal 2017 — The View AheadTurning to fiscal 2017, we expect continued strength in our revenue, operating margin and earnings per share results in comparison to fiscal 2016. These results are expected to be driven by our 7 Strategies for Growth, which include:•Be the Employer of Choice•Elevate Coffee•Grow the Store Portfolio•Create New Customer Occasions•Drive At-Home Coffee Share and Occasions•Build Teavana through Starbucks and CPG•Extend Digital EngagementIn fiscal 2017, through our 7 Strategies for Growth, we plan to expand our footprint by opening new stores and enhancing the mix and types of stores in our portfolio. Expansion of our store portfolio is expected to be coupled with continued customer attachment through our morning and lunch dayparts. And, our management team continues to align our leadership with our evolving businesses, including the development of our Global Roastery and Starbucks Reserve® branded stores. As a result of these efforts, we expect consolidated revenue growth to be approximately 8% in fiscal 2017 when compared to our 53-week results in fiscal 2016. After excluding the approximately $400 million of additional revenue attributed to the extra week in fiscal 2016, we expect consolidated revenue growth to be approximately 10% for fiscal 2017 based on a comparable 52-week year. Revenue growth is expected to be driven by comparable store sales in the mid-single digits and the opening of approximately 2,100 net new stores globally.Additionally, for fiscal 2017, we expect to continue investing in our partners and digital platforms. These investments provide enhanced wages and benefits and also focus on mobile and loyalty programs. We expect partner and digital investments to increase by approximately $250 million versus an increase of approximately $160 million in fiscal 2016, further demonstrating the importance of and value creation realized from these efforts. We plan for our consolidated operating margin to increase slightly in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016. Sales leverage and cost savings initiatives will offset investments in our business and partners. For fiscal 2017, we expect an effective tax rate of about 34%, and diluted net earnings per share to be in the range of $2.09 to $2.11.Capital expenditures in fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $1.6 billion, primarily for new stores and store renovations, as well as for other investments to support our ongoing growth initiatives.Acquisitions and DivestituresSee Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.23Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2016 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2015 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):RevenuesFiscal Year EndedOct 2, 2016 Sep 27, 2015 %ChangeNet revenues: Company-operated stores$16,844.1 $15,197.3 10.8%Licensed stores2,154.2 1,861.9 15.7CPG, foodservice and other2,317.6 2,103.5 10.2Total net revenues$21,315.9 $19,162.7 11.2%Total net revenues increased $2.2 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2015, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.6 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by 5% growth in comparable store sales ($793 million), incremental revenues from 693 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($724 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($324 million) and incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($105 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of revenue from the conversion of certain company-operated stores to licensed stores ($151 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($99 million). Licensed store revenue growth contributed $292 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily resulting from higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($285 million), largely due to the opening of 1,372 net new Starbucks® licensed stores, the transfer of 200 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales, as well as the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($41 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($33 million) and a decrease in licensed store revenues resulting from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($6 million).CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $214 million, primarily due to higher sales of premium single-serve products ($106 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($47 million), and increased foodservice sales ($34 million) and U.S. packaged coffee ($32 million).

Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 100 basis points, primarily due to a settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to the closure of Target Canada stores in the prior year (approximately 50 basis points), the lapping of impairment of certain assets in the Americas segment in the prior year (approximately 20 basis points) and improved collection results (approximately 20 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by higher salaries and benefits (approximately 30 basis points). Income from equity investees as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points due to higher income from our joint venture operations, primarily from our North American Coffee Partnership and our joint ventures in China and South Korea. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 80 basis points over fiscal 2015.Other Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedOct 2, 2016 Sep 27, 2015 Oct 2, 2016 Sep 27, 2015 As a % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income$4,171.9 $3,601.0 19.6 % 18.8 %Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture— 390.6 — 2.0Loss on extinguishment of debt— (61.1) — (0.3)Interest income and other, net108.0 43.0 0.5 0.2Interest expense(81.3) (70.5) (0.4) (0.4)Earnings before income taxes4,198.6 3,903.0 19.7 20.4Income tax expense1,379.7 1,143.7 6.5 6.0Net earnings including noncontrolling interests2,818.9 2,759.3 13.2 14.4Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests1.2 1.9 — —Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$2,817.7 $2,757.4 13.2 % 14.4 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 32.9 % 29.3 %During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a gain of $391 million as a result of remeasuring our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan to fair value upon acquisition.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a loss of $61 million related to the redemption of our $550 million of 6.250% Senior Notes (the ""2017 notes""), which were originally scheduled to mature in August 2017. The loss primarily relates to the optional redemption premium outlined in the 2017 notes indenture, as well as the derecognition of the capitalized issuance costs and unamortized discount.Interest income and other, net increased $65 million, primarily due to higher income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances ($21 million), net favorable foreign exchange fluctuations ($11 million) and gains on our trading securities portfolio ($8 million). Interest expense increased $11 million primarily due to interest on the long-term debt we issued in February and May 2016. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 32.9% compared to 29.3% for fiscal 2015. The increase in the rate for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the 3.7% impact of the gain in the prior year associated with the remeasurement of our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan upon acquisition, which was almost entirely non-taxable.25Table of ContentsSegment InformationResults of operations by segment (in millions):AmericasFiscal Year EndedOct 2, 2016 Sep 27, 2015 Oct 2, 2016 Sep 27, 2015 As a % of Americas Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$13,247.4 $11,925.6 89.5% 89.7%Licensed stores1,518.5 1,334.4 10.3 10.0Foodservice and other29.5 33.4 0.2 0.3Total net revenues14,795.4 13,293.4 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs5,271.9 4,845.0 35.6 36.4Store operating expenses4,909.3 4,387.9 33.2 33.0Other operating expenses96.0 122.8 0.6 0.9Depreciation and amortization expenses590.1 522.3 4.0 3.9General and administrative expenses186.1 192.1 1.3 1.4Total operating expenses11,053.4 10,070.1 74.7 75.8Operating income$3,742.0 $3,223.3 25.3% 24.2%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 37.1% 36.8%RevenuesAmericas total net revenues for fiscal 2016 increased $1.5 billion, or 11%, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.3 billion) and licensed stores (contributing $184 million).The increase in company-operated store revenues was driven by a 6% increase in comparable store sales ($730 million), incremental revenues from 348 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($481 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($258 million).

Partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in licensed store revenues resulting from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($45 million).CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $222 million, primarily due to increased sales of premium single-serve products ($116 million), U.S. packaged coffee ($55 million) and foodservice sales ($40 million).30Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 As a % of TotalNet RevenuesCost of sales including occupancy costs$7,787.5 $6,858.8 40.6% 41.7 %Store operating expenses5,411.1 4,638.2 28.2 28.2Other operating expenses522.4 457.3 2.7 2.8Depreciation and amortization expenses893.9 709.6 4.7 4.3General and administrative expenses1,196.7 991.3 6.2 6.0Litigation credit— (20.2) — (0.1)Total operating expenses15,811.6 13,635.0 82.5 82.9Income from equity investees249.9 268.3 1.3 1.6Operating income$3,601.0 $3,081.1 18.8% 18.7 %Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 35.6% 35.7 %Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 110 basis points, primarily driven by sales and operating leverage on cost of sales (approximately 60 basis points), driven by strong sales and initiatives in our supply chain, such as improvements in sourcing, as well as sales leverage on occupancy costs (approximately 40 basis points).Store operating expenses were flat as a percentage of total net revenues. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, decreased 10 basis points, primarily driven by sales leverage (approximately 50 basis points) and decreased expenses, largely salaries and benefits, due to the shift to more licensed stores in EMEA (approximately 40 basis points), partially offset by increased investments in store partners (employees) and digital platforms related to in-store initiatives (approximately 100 basis points) in the Americas segment.Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses were flat, primarily due to sales leverage (approximately 70 basis points), partially offset by increased marketing expenses (approximately 20 basis points), largely due to timing, the impairment of certain assets in the Americas segment (approximately 20 basis points) and the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 20 basis points).Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 30 basis points).General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 10 basis points). The $20 million decrease in litigation credit for fiscal 2015 was due to lapping a prior year credit related to a reduction of our estimated prejudgment interest payable associated with the Kraft arbitration, as a result of paying our obligation earlier than anticipated. Income from equity investees decreased $18 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan and the absence of income from our Malaysia joint venture sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by improved performance from our North American Coffee Partnership and China joint ventures. As a percentage of total revenues, income from equity investees decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 30 basis points).The overall increase in operating margin of 10 basis points was driven by the changes discussed above, including the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan and the acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, which contributed unfavorably to operating margin (approximately 90 basis points).31Table of ContentsOther Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 As a % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income$3,601.0 $3,081.1 18.8 % 18.7 %Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture390.6 — 2.0 —Loss on extinguishment of debt(61.1) — (0.3) —Interest income and other, net43.0 142.7 0.2 0.9Interest expense(70.5) (64.1) (0.4) (0.4)Earnings before income taxes3,903.0 3,159.7 20.4 19.2Income tax expense1,143.7 1,092.0 6.0 6.6Net earnings including noncontrolling interests2,759.3 2,067.7 14.4 12.6Net earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests1.9 (0.4) — —Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$2,757.4 $2,068.1 14.4 % 12.6 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 29.3 % 34.6 %During the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a gain of $391 million as a result of remeasuring our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan to fair value upon acquisition.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded a loss of $61 million related to the redemption of our $550 million of 6.250% Senior Notes (the ""2017 notes""), which were originally scheduled to mature in August 2017. The loss primarily relates to the optional redemption premium outlined in the 2017 notes indenture, as well as the derecognition of the capitalized issuance costs and unamortized discount.Interest income and other, net decreased $100 million, primarily due to lapping the gain on the sale of our equity interest in our Malaysia joint venture ($68 million) in the prior year and net unfavorable fair value adjustments from derivative instruments used to manage our risk of commodity price fluctuations ($25 million) in fiscal 2015.Interest expense increased $6 million primarily due to incurring a full quarter of interest in the first quarter of fiscal 2015 on the long-term debt we issued in December of fiscal 2014 as well as the reclassification of $2 million from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense related to remaining unrecognized losses from interest rate contracts associated with the 2017 notes redeemed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2015 was 29.3% compared to 34.6% for fiscal 2014. The decrease in the rate for fiscal 2015 was primarily due to the 3.7% impact of the gain associated with the remeasurement of our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan upon acquisition, which was almost entirely non-taxable, as well as the 1.5% incremental tax benefit related to domestic manufacturing deductions claimed in fiscal 2015 on U.S. corporate income tax returns for fiscal years 2011 through 2015.32Table of ContentsSegment InformationResults of operations by segment (in millions):AmericasFiscal Year EndedSep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 As a % of Americas Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$11,925.6 $10,866.5 89.7% 90.7%Licensed stores1,334.4 1,074.9 10.0 9.0Foodservice and other33.4 39.1 0.3 0.3Total net revenues13,293.4 11,980.5 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs4,845.0 4,487.0 36.4 37.5Store operating expenses4,387.9 3,946.8 33.0 32.9Other operating expenses122.8 100.4 0.9 0.8Depreciation and amortization expenses522.3 469.5 3.9 3.9General and administrative expenses192.1 167.8 1.4 1.4Total operating expenses10,070.1 9,171.5 75.8 76.6Operating income$3,223.3 $2,809.0 24.2% 23.4%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 36.8% 36.3%RevenuesAmericas total net revenues for fiscal 2015 increased $1.3 billion, or 11%, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.1 billion) and licensed stores (contributing $260 million).The increase in company-operated store revenues was driven by a 7% increase in comparable store sales ($745 million), as well as incremental revenues from 318 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($455 million). Partially offsetting these increases was unfavorable foreign currency translation ($139 million), primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar. The increase in licensed store revenues was primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees, resulting from increased La Boulange™ food sales to our licensees beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2015, as well as the opening of 317 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales.Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 110 basis points, primarily driven by leverage on cost of sales (approximately 60 basis points), lower commodity costs (approximately 30 basis points), mainly dairy, and sales leverage on occupancy costs (approximately 30 basis points).Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 10 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses increased 50 basis points, primarily driven by increased investments in store partners (employees) and digital platforms related to in-store initiatives (approximately 130 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage (approximately 100 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses were flat, primarily driven by sales leverage (approximately 60 basis points), offset by the impairment of certain assets in the region (approximately 60 basis points).Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total revenues were flat, primarily driven by sales leverage (approximately 10 basis points), offset by incremental costs from investments in our existing store portfolio (approximately 10 basis points).The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 80 basis points over fiscal 2014.33Table of ContentsChina/Asia PacificFiscal Year EndedSep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 Sep 27, 2015 Sep 28, 2014 As a % of China/Asia Pacific Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$2,127.3 $859.4 88.8% 76.1%Licensed stores264.4 270.2 11.0 23.9Foodservice and other4.2 — 0.2 —Total net revenues2,395.9 1,129.6 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs1,071.5 547.4 44.7 48.5Store operating expenses609.8 221.1 25.5 19.6Other operating expenses62.2 48.0 2.6 4.2Depreciation and amortization expenses150.7 46.1 6.3 4.1General and administrative expenses120.8 58.5 5.0 5.2Total operating expenses2,015.0 921.1 84.1 81.5Income from equity investees119.6 164.0 5.0 14.5Operating income$500.5 $372.5 20.9% 33.0%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 28.7% 25.7%Discussion of our China/Asia Pacific segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating Starbucks Japan due to the ownership change from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of October 31, 2014. Under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product cost of sales as well as our proportionate share of Starbucks Japan's net earnings, which we recognized within income from equity investees. This resulted in a lower gross margin and a very high operating margin. Under the company-operated ownership model, Starbucks Japan's operating results are reflected in most income statement lines of this segment and have an operating margin more in line with that of our other retail businesses.RevenuesChina/Asia Pacific total net revenues for fiscal 2015 increased $1.3 billion, or 112%, largely due to increased revenues from company-operated stores ($1.3 billion). The increase in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by incremental revenues from the acquisition of Starbucks Japan ($1.1 billion). Also contributing were incremental revenues from the opening of 247 net new company-operated stores over the past 12 months ($160 million) and a 9% increase in comparable store sales ($74 million).Licensed store revenues decreased $6 million, primarily due to our ownership change in Starbucks Japan to mostly company-operated stores ($45 million). This decrease was partially offset by increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($27 million), resulting from the opening of 520 net new licensed store openings over the past 12 months, improved comparable store sales, and incremental revenues from the ownership changes in Australia and Malaysia ($17 million) in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014.Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 380 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 230 basis points) and the shift in our cost of sales mix resulting from growth of company-operated stores, which have a higher gross margin (approximately 50 basis points). Sales leverage (approximately 40 basis points) also contributed.Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 590 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses increased 300 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 410 basis points), partially offset by the sale of our Australia retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 (approximately 70 basis points) and sales leverage (approximately 50 basis points). Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 160 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses increased 540 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 350 basis points) as well as increased salaries and benefits largely due to increased headcount to support growth in our China market (approximately 150 basis points). 34Table of ContentsDepreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased 220 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 210 basis points).General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased 20 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage (approximately 40 basis points) and the impact of the sale of our Australia retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014 (approximately 20 basis points), which includes lapping professional fees associated with the sale. The impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan contributed unfavorably (approximately 60 basis points).Income from equity investees decreased $44 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan and absence of income from our Malaysia joint venture sold in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014, partially offset by improved performance from our China joint venture.

The decrease was primarily due to a decline in company-operated store revenues ($103 million), which was largely due to unfavorable foreign currency translation ($94 million). Also contributing to the decrease in company-operated revenues was the shift to more licensed stores in the region, which includes net store closures as well as the absence of revenues from the conversion of certain stores in the U.K. from company-operated to licensed. This decline was partially offset by 4% growth in comparable store sales.Licensed store revenues increased $19 million, or 8%, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($45 million), resulting from the opening of 238 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($22 million).Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 210 basis points, primarily due to favorable foreign currency exchange (approximately 130 basis points). We buy and sell products, primarily roasted coffee, in multiple currencies throughout the region depending on the functional currency of each market. Differences in those rates generated favorable foreign currency exchange for fiscal 2015 resulting in a benefit in cost of sales. Sales leverage(approximately 40 basis points) also contributed to the decrease.Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 290 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 220 basis points primarily due to gains on the sales of certain store 35Table of Contentsassets in the region (approximately 150 basis points) as well as decreased expenses, largely salaries and benefits, driven by the shift to more licensed stores (approximately 40 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 60 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 20 basis points, primarily driven by the gains on the sales of certain assets in the region (approximately 40 basis points) and improved collection results (approximately 20 basis points). These decreases were partially offset by increased costs to grow our non-retail operations in the region (approximately 50 basis points), largely driven by higher marketing costs.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 460 basis points over fiscal 2014.

We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (foreign and domestic), mortgage and asset-backed securities, state and local government obligations and agency obligations. As of October 2, 2016, approximately $1.6 billion of cash and investments were held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing capacityIn the first quarter of fiscal 2016, we replaced our 2013 credit facility with our new $1.5 billion unsecured, revolving 2016 credit facility (the ""credit facility"") with various banks, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit.The credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases, and is currently set to mature on November 6, 2020. Starbucks has the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $750 million. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the credit agreement. The current applicable margin is 0.565% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.00% (nil) for Base Rate Loans. The credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of October 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of October 2, 2016.Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facility discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 2, 2016, we had no borrowings under our commercial paper program. 37Table of ContentsIn May 2016, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 10-year 2.450% Senior Notes (the ""2026 notes"") due June 2026. We will use the net proceeds from the offering to enhance our sustainability programs around coffee supply chain management through Eligible Sustainability Projects. Interest on the 2026 notes is payable semi-annually on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing on December 15, 2016. In February 2016, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 5-year 2.100% Senior Notes (the ""2021 notes"") due February 2021. In May 2016, we reopened this offering with the same terms and issued an additional $250 million of Senior Notes (collectively, the ""2021 notes"") for an aggregate amount outstanding of $750 million. Interest on the 2021 notes is payable semi-annually on February 4 and August 4 of each year, commencing on August 4, 2016. See Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.The indentures under which all of our Senior Notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of October 2, 2016, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of CashWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures, new product innovations, related marketing support and partner and digital investments, return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. We have borrowed funds domestically and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future.We consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of October 2, 2016 to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs; however, in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the U.S., we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, which could be material. We do not believe it is practicable to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation, as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation, including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation, tax rates in effect and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation.During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2015, we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.16 per share. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 we declared a cash dividend of $0.20 per share. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2016 and 2015 totaled $1,178.0 million and $958.7 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016, we declared a cash dividend of $0.25 per share to be paid on December 2, 2016 with an expected payout of approximately $365.1 million.During fiscal years 2016 and 2015, we repurchased 34.9 million and 29.0 million shares of common stock, respectively, or $2.0 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, under our ongoing share repurchase program. On April 21, 2016, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase of 100 million shares to the program. Including this additional authorization of 100 million shares, the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at October 2, 2016 totaled 117.8 million. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2017 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new company-operated stores; remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing company-operated stores; systems and technology investments in our stores and in the support infrastructure; and additional investments in manufacturing capacity. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2017 are expected to be approximately $1.6 billion.38Table of ContentsCash FlowsCash provided by operating activities was $4.6 billion for fiscal 2016, compared to $3.7 billion for fiscal 2015. The change was primarily due to increased earnings, the lapping of the non-cash acquisition related gain for Starbucks Japan and the timing of our cash payments for income taxes.Cash used by investing activities totaled $2.2 billion for fiscal 2016, compared to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2015. The change was primarily due to the increase in purchases of investments, primarily government treasury securities and corporate debt securities, partially offset by the lapping of cash used to acquire Sazaby's 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan.Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2016 totaled $1.8 billion, compared to $2.3 billion for fiscal 2015. The change was primarily due to the lapping of long-term debt redemption in fiscal 2015, higher incremental proceeds from long-term debt issued in February and May 2016 over prior year's issuance and lapping of cash used to fund the second tender offer step of the Starbucks Japan acquisition. These reductions in cash used were partially offset by increased cash returned to shareholders through higher share repurchases and dividend payments compared to fiscal 2015. Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of October 2, 2016, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (1)Total Less than 1Year 1 - 3Years 3 - 5Years More than5 YearsOperating lease obligations(2)$7,285.0 $1,125.1 $1,902.6 $1,561.8 $2,695.5Financing lease obligations62.0 4.3 8.6 8.4 40.7Debt obligations Principal payments3,600.0 400.0 350.0 750.0 2,100.0Interest payments932.2 94.2 181.3 163.0 493.7Purchase obligations(3)1,223.1 786.4 371.5 57.5 7.7Other obligations(4)182.7 18.2 35.7 16.5 112.3Total$13,285.0 $2,428.2 $2,849.7 $2,557.2 $5,449.9(1) Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. As of October 2, 2016, we had $154.2 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, which includes accrued interest and penalties.(2) Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses.(3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 90% of total purchase obligations.(4) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations and hedging instruments. Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONSCommodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.39Table of ContentsFINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. In general, hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.Commodity Price RiskWe purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 2, 2016 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (""OCI"") from changes in commodity prices.

However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, Japanese yen, Chinese renminbi, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 2, 2016 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates.

Trading securities are recorded at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded in interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. Our trading securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (""MDCP""), which is included in accrued compensation and related costs, within accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Changes in our MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings.40Table of ContentsWe performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of October 2, 2016 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.Interest Rate RiskLong-term DebtWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of October 2, 2016.The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of October 2, 2016 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): Change in Fair Value Stated Interest Rate Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying Rate 2016 notes0.875% $400 $— $—2018 notes2.000% $357 $(7) $72021 notes2.100% $766 $(31) $312022 notes2.700% $526 $(27) $272023 notes3.850% $839 $(51) $512026 notes2.450% $509 $(43) $432045 notes4.300% $417 $(70) $70Available-for-Sale SecuritiesOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for-sale securities. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of October 2, 2016 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESCritical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.41Table of ContentsProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived AssetsWe evaluate property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. During fiscal 2016, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit or intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit or intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows. When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of 42Table of Contentsstrategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.For fiscal 2016, we determined the fair value of our material reporting units and intangible asset groups were significantly in excess of their carrying values. Accordingly, we did not recognize any material impairment charges during the current fiscal year. During fiscal 2016, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future; however, we do not expect changes from recently enacted tax laws to be material to the consolidated financial statements.In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and expected consent from taxing authorities.We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that has not been subject to U.S. income taxes. We intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. 43Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Commodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions"" and ""Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Risk Management"" in Item 7 of this Report.44Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:46:18.417188
829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2017,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGeneralOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal year ended on October 1, 2017 included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended on October 2, 2016 included 53 weeks, with the extra week falling in our fourth fiscal quarter, and the fiscal year ended on September 27, 2015 included 52 weeks. Comparable store sales percentages below are calculated excluding the 53rd week. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.Financial Highlights•Total net revenues increased 5% to $22.4 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $21.3 billion in fiscal 2016. Excluding $412.4 million from extra week of fiscal 2016, net revenues grew 7%. •Global comparable store sales grew 3% driven by a 3% increase in average ticket. •Consolidated operating income decreased to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to operating income of $4.2 billion in fiscal 2016. Fiscal 2017 operating margin was 18.5% compared to 19.6% in fiscal 2016. Operating margin compression in fiscal 2017 was primarily driven by increased partner (employee) and digital investments, largely in the Americas segment, restructuring and impairment charges and the absence of the 53rd week, partially offset by sales leverage.•Restructuring and impairment charges for fiscal 2017 were $153.5 million and primarily related to our strategic changes in our Teavana business including a partial goodwill impairment, store asset impairments, costs associated with early closure of stores and severance. Additional amounts incurred related to an impairment of our Switzerland retail business and asset impairments of certain Starbucks® company-operated stores in Canada.•Earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2017 increased to $1.97, compared to EPS of $1.90 in fiscal 2016, which benefited $0.06 per share from the extra week in fiscal 2016. The increase was primarily driven by growth in comparable store sales, improved sales leverage and the gain on the sale of Singapore retail operations, partially offset by restructuring and impairment charges.•Cash flows from operations were $4.2 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $4.6 billion in fiscal 2016. The change was primarily due to the timing of our cash payments for income taxes.•Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in fiscal 2017 compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2016.•We returned $3.5 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2017 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $3.2 billion in fiscal 2016.OverviewStarbucks results for fiscal 2017 continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model, and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners. Consolidated total net revenues increased 5% to $22.4 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 2,320 net new store openings over the past 12 months and a 3% growth in global comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week. Consolidated operating income declined $37 million, or 1%, to $4.1 billion. Operating margin declined 110 basis points to 18.5%, primarily due to increased partner investments, largely in the Americas segment, restructuring and impairment charges and the absence of the 53rd week, partially offset by sales leverage. Earnings per share of $1.97 increased 4% over the prior year earnings per share of $1.90.Americas revenue grew by 6% to $15.7 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 952 net new store openings over the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 3%, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week. The success of our premium food offerings coupled with innovation across our coffee and tea beverage platforms drove the increase in comparable store sales. Operating income declined $79 million to $3.7 billion and operating margin at 23.4% declined by 190 basis points from a year ago, primarily due to increased investments in our store partners, a product mix shift largely towards food, and the absence of the 53rd week. These were partially offset by sales leverage. In our China/Asia Pacific segment, revenues grew by 10% to $3.2 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from the opening of 1,036 net new stores over the past 12 months and a 3% increase in comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Operating income grew 21% to $765 million, while operating margin expanded 210 basis points to 23.6%. The overall margin expansion was primarily due to the transition to China's new value added tax structure in fiscal 2016 and higher income from our joint venture operations. We now operate 7,479 stores in 15 countries in our China/Asia Pacific segment making this the second largest reportable segment.23Table of ContentsWe continue to execute on our strategy of repositioning the EMEA segment to a predominantly licensed model. As a result of this strategy, EMEA revenues declined $111 million to $1.0 billion, or 10%, primarily driven by the absence of revenue related to the sale of our Germany retail operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and unfavorable foreign currency translation. Partially offsetting the decrease were incremental revenues from the opening of 339 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months. Operating margin declined 200 basis points to 11.5% primarily due to a partial impairment of goodwill related to our Switzerland retail business, sales deleverage in certain company-operated stores and unfavorable foreign currency exchange. These decreases were partially offset by sales leverage driven by the shift in the portfolio towards more licensed stores.Channel Development segment revenues grew by 4% to $2.0 billion, primarily driven by increased sales through our international channels and sales of packaged coffee, foodservice and single-serve products. When excluding the revenue of the 53rd week in fiscal 2016, segment revenues grew by 6%. Operating income grew $86 million, or 11%, to $893 million. Operating margin increased 270 basis points to 44.5%, primarily driven by lower coffee costs, leverage on cost of sales and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture.Fiscal 2018 — The View AheadTurning to fiscal 2018, we expect continued growth through thoughtful long-term investments that create value and reward shareholders. These results are expected to be driven by our 6 operational priorities, which include:•Accelerate U.S. Comparable Store Sales•Drive Innovation in Food and Beverage•Accelerate the Power and Momentum of our Digital Platform•Enable Long-Term Growth in China •Elevate the Starbucks Experience through Siren Retail•Gain Share of At-Home CoffeeThese priorities are our main focus to grow our core business with new customer acquisition through store growth, digital engagement and innovation, while we continue to foster long-term customer relationships. To successfully achieve these priorities, we will undertake a number of initiatives, including the pending transaction to acquire full ownership of our joint venture in East China and converting our Taiwan and Singapore markets to fully licensed operations. We are in the process of exiting certain activities including closing Teavana™ retail stores and certain Starbucks company-operated stores in Canada, the pending sale of our Tazo brand and related assets, and aggressively rationalizing merchandise in our U.S. retail stores. These strategic actions will enable us to focus on businesses and products with the highest growth potential and greatest prospect for returns. We expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits for the underlying business in fiscal 2018 driven by comparable store sales and the opening of approximately 2,300 net new Starbucks stores globally. An additional 2 to 3 points of revenue growth is expected related to the aforementioned strategic initiatives.Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2018 is expected to grow in excess of 40% when compared to fiscal 2017, largely due to the anticipated gain associated with the pending acquisition of East China. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion, primarily for investments in our new and existing stores, our developing Siren Retail business and our supply chain and corporate facilities.During the fiscal year, our expected strong operational performance combined with the prudent leveraging of our balance sheet will enable us to return significant value to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Acquisitions and DivestituresSee Note 2, Acquisitions and Divestitures, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.24Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2017 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2016 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):RevenuesFiscal Year EndedOct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 %Change (52 Weeks Ended) (53 Weeks Ended) Net revenues: Company-operated stores$17,650.7 $16,844.1 4.8%Licensed stores2,355.0 2,154.2 9.3CPG, foodservice and other2,381.1 2,317.6 2.7Total net revenues$22,386.8 $21,315.9 5.0%Total net revenues increased $1.1 billion, or 5%, over fiscal 2016, primarily driven by increased revenues from company-operated stores ($807 million). The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by incremental revenues from 768 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($869 million) and a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($496 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket. Partially offsetting these incremental revenues was the absence of the 53rd week ($324 million), the absence of sales from the conversion of certain company-operated stores to licensed stores ($121 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($70 million). Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenue ($201 million), primarily due to increased product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($260 million), largely due to the opening of 1,552 net new Starbucks® licensed stores and improved comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($41 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation ($27 million).CPG, foodservice and other revenues increased $64 million, driven by increased sales through our international channels, primarily associated with our European and North American regions ($35 million), increased sales of U.S. packaged coffee ($32 million), foodservice ($30 million) and premium single-serve products ($23 million). Increased sales were partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($47 million) and an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to periods prior to fiscal 2017 ($13 million).Operating ExpensesFiscal Year EndedOct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 Oct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 (52 Weeks Ended) (53 Weeks Ended) As a % of TotalNet RevenuesCost of sales including occupancy costs$9,038.2 $8,511.1 40.4% 39.9%Store operating expenses6,493.3 6,064.3 29.0 28.4Other operating expenses553.8 545.4 2.5 2.6Depreciation and amortization expenses1,011.4 980.8 4.5 4.6General and administrative expenses1,393.3 1,360.6 6.2 6.4Restructuring and impairments153.5 — 0.7 —Total operating expenses18,643.5 17,462.2 83.3 81.9Income from equity investees391.4 318.2 1.7 1.5Operating income$4,134.7 $4,171.9 18.5% 19.6%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 36.8% 36.0%Other operating expenses as a % of non-company-operated store revenues 11.7% 12.2%Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily driven by a product mix shift (approximately 70 basis points) largely towards premium food in the Americas segment, partially offset by leverage on cost of sales and occupancy costs (approximately 30 basis points). 25Table of ContentsStore operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 60 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 80 basis points, primarily driven by higher partner and digital investments, largely in the Americas segment (approximately 150 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage (approximately 90 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 50 basis points, primarily due to lower performance-based compensation (approximately 20 basis points). General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 20 basis points, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation (approximately 30 basis points), and employment taxes, including the lapping of higher employment taxes resulting from a multiple year audit in the prior year (approximately 20 basis points). These were partially offset by increased salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations.Restructuring and impairments charges in fiscal 2017 were primarily the result of our strategic changes in Teavana. We recorded $130 million of restructuring–related costs, including a partial goodwill impairment of $69 million, store asset impairments, and costs related to early store closure obligations and severance. Additionally, we recorded $18 million of partial goodwill impairment relating to our Switzerland retail business.Income from equity investees increased $73 million, due to higher income from our CAP joint venture operations, primarily China and South Korea, as well as our North American Coffee Partnership.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 110 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016.Other Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedOct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 Oct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 (52 Weeks Ended) (53 Weeks Ended) As a % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income$4,134.7 $4,171.9 18.5 % 19.6 %Interest income and other, net275.3 108.0 1.2 0.5Interest expense(92.5) (81.3) (0.4) (0.4)Earnings before income taxes4,317.5 4,198.6 19.3 19.7Income tax expense1,432.6 1,379.7 6.4 6.5Net earnings including noncontrolling interests2,884.9 2,818.9 12.9 13.2Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests0.2 1.2 — —Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$2,884.7 $2,817.7 12.9 % 13.2 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 33.2 % 32.9 %Interest income and other, net increased $167 million, primarily driven by gains from the sale of our Singapore retail operations ($84 million) and our investment in Square, Inc. warrants ($41 million). Also contributing favorably was higher income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances ($44 million). Interest expense increased $11 million primarily related to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in February 2016, May 2016 and March 2017, partially offset by lower interest expense from the repayment of our December 2016 notes. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 33.2% compared to 32.9% for fiscal 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to unfavorability from non-deductible goodwill impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (approximately 70 basis points), and the lapping of the release of certain tax reserves in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily related to statute closures (approximately 30 basis points). The increase was partially offset by the largely non-taxable gain on the sale of our Singapore retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 (approximately 70 basis points).26Table of ContentsSegment InformationResults of operations by segment (in millions):AmericasFiscal Year EndedOct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 Oct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 (52 Weeks Ended) (53 Weeks Ended) As a % of Americas Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$13,996.4 $13,247.4 89.4% 89.5%Licensed stores1,617.3 1,518.5 10.3 10.3Foodservice and other39.0 29.5 0.2 0.2Total net revenues15,652.7 14,795.4 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs5,720.3 5,271.9 36.5 35.6Store operating expenses5,320.2 4,909.3 34.0 33.2Other operating expenses128.5 96.0 0.8 0.6Depreciation and amortization expenses615.0 590.1 3.9 4.0General and administrative expenses201.4 186.1 1.3 1.3Restructuring and impairments4.1 — —% —%Total operating expenses11,989.5 11,053.4 76.6 74.7Operating income$3,663.2 $3,742.0 23.4% 25.3%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 38.0% 37.1%Other operating expenses as a % of non-company-operated store revenues 7.8% 6.2%RevenuesAmericas total net revenues for fiscal 2017 increased $857 million, or 6%, over fiscal 2016, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $749 million) and licensed stores (contributing $99 million).The increase in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 383 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($585 million) and a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($426 million), attributable to a 4% increase in average ticket, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($258 million) The increase in licensed store revenues was primarily driven by increased product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($127 million), primarily resulting from the opening of 569 net new Starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($31 million).Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 90 basis points, primarily due to a product mix shift (approximately 70 basis points) largely towards premium food.

Also contributing to the decline was unfavorable foreign currency translation ($43 million) and the absence of the 53rd week ($11 million). Licensed store revenues increased $68 million, driven by higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($95 million), resulting from the opening of 339 net new licensed stores and the transfer of 14 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months.

While this adjustment was immaterial, the discussion below quantifies the impact to provide a better understanding of our results for fiscal 2017.RevenuesChannel Development total net revenues for fiscal 2017 increased $76 million, or 4%, over fiscal 2016. CPG revenue growth was driven by increased sales through our international channels, primarily associated with our European and North American regions ($35 million), U.S. packaged coffee ($32 million) and premium single-serve products ($23 million). Higher foodservice sales were primarily the result of a change to a direct distribution model and recognizing the benefit of full revenue from premium single-serve product sales. Increased sales were partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($40 million) and an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to prior periods ($13 million). Operating ExpensesCost of sales as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 50 basis points, primarily driven by lower coffee costs (approximately 90 basis points) and leverage on cost of sales (approximately 60 basis points), partially offset by a shift toward lower margin products (approximately 100 basis points) and the revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to prior periods (approximately 30 basis points). Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation (approximately 40 basis points).General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 40 basis points, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation (approximately 20 basis points) and salaries and benefits (approximately 10 basis points).Income from equity investees increased $28 million for fiscal 2017, due to higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, driven by increased sales of Frappuccino® and Starbucks Doubleshot® beverages as well as new product launches over the past 12 months.The combination of these changes contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 270 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016.30Table of ContentsAll Other SegmentsFiscal Year EndedOct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 % Change (52 Weeks Ended) (53 Weeks Ended) Net revenues: Company-operated stores$197.3 $224.3 (12.0)%Licensed stores2.6 3.9 (33.3)CPG, foodservice and other271.7 296.1 (8.2)Total net revenues471.6 524.3 (10.1)Cost of sales including occupancy costs308.0 316.5 (2.7)Store operating expenses113.5 115.0 (1.3)Other operating expenses68.2 91.4 (25.4)Depreciation and amortization expenses10.1 13.3 (24.1)General and administrative expenses14.6 26.5 (44.9)Restructuring and impairments131.5 — nmTotal operating expenses645.9 562.7 14.8Operating loss$(174.3) $(38.4) 353.9 %All Other Segments primarily includes Teavana-branded stores, Seattle’s Best Coffee, as well as certain developing businesses such as Siren Retail.

The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by 5% growth in comparable store sales ($793 million), incremental revenues from 693 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($724 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($324 million) and incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($105 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the absence of revenue from the conversion of certain company-operated stores to licensed stores ($151 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($99 million).Licensed store revenue growth contributed $292 million to the increase in total net revenues, primarily resulting from higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($285 million), largely due to the opening of 1,372 net new Starbucks® licensed stores, the transfer of 200 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales, as well as the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($41 million).

The loss primarily relates to the optional redemption premium outlined in the 2017 notes indenture, as well as the derecognition of the capitalized issuance costs and unamortized discount.Interest income and other, net increased $65 million, primarily due to higher income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances ($21 million), net favorable foreign exchange fluctuations ($11 million) and gains on our trading securities portfolio ($8 million).Interest expense increased $11 million primarily due to interest on the long-term debt we issued in February and May 2016.Our tax rate is affected by recurring items, such as tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and the relative amounts of income we earn in those jurisdictions, as well as discrete items that may occur in any given year, but are not consistent from year to year. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2016 was 32.9% compared to 29.3% for fiscal 2015. The increase in the rate for fiscal 2016 was primarily due to the 3.7% impact of the gain in the prior year associated with the remeasurement of our preexisting 39.5% ownership interest in Starbucks Japan upon acquisition, which was almost entirely non-taxable.33Table of ContentsSegment InformationResults of operations by segment (in millions):AmericasFiscal Year EndedOct 2, 2016 Sep 27, 2015 Oct 2, 2016 Sep 27, 2015 (53 Weeks Ended) (52 Weeks Ended) As a % of Americas Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$13,247.4 $11,925.6 89.5% 89.7%Licensed stores1,518.5 1,334.4 10.3 10.0Foodservice and other29.5 33.4 0.2 0.3Total net revenues14,795.4 13,293.4 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs5,271.9 4,845.0 35.6 36.4Store operating expenses4,909.3 4,387.9 33.2 33.0Other operating expenses96.0 122.8 0.6 0.9Depreciation and amortization expenses590.1 522.3 4.0 3.9General and administrative expenses186.1 192.1 1.3 1.4Total operating expenses11,053.4 10,070.1 74.7 75.8Operating income$3,742.0 $3,223.3 25.3% 24.2%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 37.1% 36.8%Other operating expenses as a % of non-company-operated store revenues 6.2% 9.0%RevenuesAmericas total net revenues for fiscal 2016 increased $1.5 billion, or 11%, primarily due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $1.3 billion) and licensed stores (contributing $184 million).The increase in company-operated store revenues was driven by a 6% increase in comparable store sales ($730 million), incremental revenues from 348 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($481 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($258 million). Partially offsetting these increases was unfavorable foreign currency translation ($91 million), primarily driven by the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar.The increase in licensed store revenues was primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($150 million), resulting from the opening of 456 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months and improved comparable store sales, as well as the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($31 million).Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 80 basis points, primarily driven by leverage on cost of sales and occupancy costs (approximately 50 basis points) and lower commodity costs (approximately 40 basis points).Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points.

Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 280 basis points, primarily due to a settlement in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 related to the closure of Target Canada stores in the prior year (approximately 140 basis points), the lapping of impairment of certain assets in the region (approximately 60 basis points) and improved collection results (approximately 40 basis points).The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 110 basis points over fiscal 2015.34Table of ContentsChina/Asia PacificFiscal Year EndedOct 2, 2016 Sep 27, 2015 Oct 2, 2016 Sep 27, 2015 (53 Weeks Ended) (52 Weeks Ended) As a % of China/Asia Pacific Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$2,640.4 $2,127.3 89.8% 88.8%Licensed stores292.3 264.4 9.9 11.0Foodservice and other6.1 4.2 0.2 0.2Total net revenues2,938.8 2,395.9 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs1,296.7 1,071.5 44.1 44.7Store operating expenses779.4 609.8 26.5 25.5Other operating expenses70.3 62.2 2.4 2.6Depreciation and amortization expenses180.6 150.7 6.1 6.3General and administrative expenses130.3 120.8 4.4 5.0Total operating expenses2,457.3 2,015.0 83.6 84.1Income from equity investees150.1 119.6 5.1 5.0Operating income$631.6 $500.5 21.5% 20.9%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 29.5% 28.7%Other operating expenses as a % of non-company-operated store revenues 23.6% 23.2%RevenuesChina/Asia Pacific total net revenues for fiscal 2016 increased $543 million, or 23%, largely due to increased revenues from company-operated stores (contributing $513 million). The increase in company-operated store revenues was primarily due to the opening of 359 net new company-operated stores over the past 12 months ($246 million) and incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership in Starbucks Japan ($105 million). Also contributing was a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($61 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($52 million) and favorable foreign currency translation ($49 million).Licensed store revenues increased $28 million, primarily due to increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($47 million), resulting from the opening of 622 net new licensed store openings over the past 12 months, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($15 million) and a decrease in licensed store revenues resulting from the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan ($6 million).Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 30 basis points) and favorability from changes to certain business tax structures in China (30 basis points).Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 100 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses increased 80 basis points, primarily driven by higher partner and digital investments and payroll-related expenditures (approximately 90 basis points) and the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 40 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage on salaries and benefits (approximately 60 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 20 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses increased 40 basis points, primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures (approximately 140 basis points), investments in digital platforms (approximately 80 basis points) and the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 60 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage (approximately 220 basis points).General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage on salaries and benefits (approximately 40 basis points).Income from equity investees as a percentage of total net revenues increased 10 basis points, primarily due to higher income from our joint venture operations, primarily in China and South Korea (approximately 70 basis points and 60 basis points, 35Table of Contentsrespectively), partially offset by the shift in composition of our store portfolio to more company-operated stores (approximately 50 basis points) and the impact of our ownership change in Starbucks Japan (approximately 50 basis points).The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 60 basis points over fiscal 2015.EMEAFiscal Year EndedOct 2, 2016 Sep 27, 2015 Oct 2, 2016 Sep 27, 2015 (53 Weeks Ended) (52 Weeks Ended) As a % of EMEA Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$732.0 $911.2 65.1% 74.9%Licensed stores339.5 257.2 30.2 21.1Foodservice53.4 48.3 4.7 4.0Total net revenues1,124.9 1,216.7 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs565.0 582.5 50.2 47.9Store operating expenses260.6 308.7 23.2 25.4Other operating expenses57.0 51.8 5.1 4.3Depreciation and amortization expenses40.8 52.0 3.6 4.3General and administrative expenses51.4 56.6 4.6 4.7Total operating expenses974.8 1,051.6 86.7 86.4Income from equity investees1.5 3.1 0.1 0.3Operating income$151.6 $168.2 13.5% 13.8%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 35.6% 33.9%Other operating expenses as a % of non-company-operated store revenues 14.5% 17.0%RevenuesEMEA total net revenues for fiscal 2016 decreased $92 million, or 8%. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in company-operated store revenues ($179 million), which was largely due to the shift to more licensed stores in the region ($132 million) and includes the absence of revenues related to the sale of our Germany retail operations, and unfavorable foreign currency translation ($69 million). These decreases were partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($18 million).Licensed store revenues increased $82 million, or 32%, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($89 million), resulting from the opening of 294 net new licensed stores and the transfer of 200 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months. Also contributing was the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2016 ($6 million). These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($12 million).Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 230 basis points, primarily due to the shift in composition of our store portfolio in the region to more licensed stores (approximately 140 basis points), sales deleverage at certain company-owned stores (approximately 80 basis points) and foreign currency transactions (approximately 50 basis points).Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 220 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses increased 170 basis points, primarily due to costs associated with the sale of our Germany retail operations and a decrease in company-operated store sales as a result of the shift to more licensed stores in the region (approximately 70 basis points). Sales deleverage at certain company-owned stores, largely related to salaries and benefits, also contributed unfavorably (approximately 70 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 80 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 250 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage driven by the shift to more licensed stores in the region (approximately 250 basis points).Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily due to the shift in the composition of our store portfolio in the region to more licensed stores (approximately 40 basis points).36Table of ContentsIncome from equity investees as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 20 basis points as a result of the sale of our ownership interest in our Spanish joint venture, Starbucks Coffee España, S.L., in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 (approximately 20 basis points).The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 30 basis points over fiscal 2015.Channel DevelopmentFiscal Year EndedOct 2, 2016 Sep 27, 2015 Oct 2, 2016 Sep 27, 2015 (53 Weeks Ended) (52 Weeks Ended) As a % of Channel Development Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: CPG$1,488.2 $1,329.0 77.0% 76.8%Foodservice444.3 401.9 23.0 23.2Total net revenues1,932.5 1,730.9 100.0 100.0Cost of sales1,042.6 974.8 54.0 56.3Other operating expenses228.5 210.5 11.8 12.2Depreciation and amortization expenses2.8 2.7 0.1 0.2General and administrative expenses17.9 16.2 0.9 0.9Total operating expenses1,291.8 1,204.2 66.8 69.6Income from equity investees166.6 127.2 8.6 7.3Operating income$807.3 $653.9 41.8% 37.8%RevenuesChannel Development total net revenues for fiscal 2016 increased $202 million, or 12%, over the prior year, primarily driven by higher sales of premium single-serve products ($101 million).

We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign), mortgage and asset-backed securities, agency obligations, and state and local government obligations. As of October 1, 2017, approximately $2.1 billion of cash and investments were held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing capacityDuring the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we replaced our $1.5 billion 2016 credit facility with a new $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the “2018 credit facility”) and a $1.0 billion unsecured 364-Day credit facility (the “364-day credit facility”), which are available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases.The 2018 credit facility, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on October 25, 2022. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the five-year credit agreement. The current applicable margin is 0.565% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.00% (nil) for Base Rate Loans. The 364-day credit facility, of which no amount may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on October 24, 2018. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is 0.585% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.00% (nil) for Base Rate Loans.Both credit facilities contain provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of October 1, 2017, we were in compliance 38Table of Contentswith all applicable 2016 credit facility covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2016 credit facility as of October 1, 2017.During the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we increased our commercial paper program from $1 billion to $3 billion, allowing us to issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to this maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time. Individual maturities may vary but cannot exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facilities discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 1, 2017, we had no borrowings under our former commercial paper program. In March 2017, we issued Japanese yen-denominated long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering. The 7-year 0.372% Senior Notes (the “2024 notes”) due March 2024 were issued with a face value of ¥85 billion, or $758.3 million, as of July 2, 2017. We will use the net proceeds from the offering to enhance our sustainability programs around coffee supply chain management through eligible sustainability projects. Interest on the 2024 notes is payable semi-annually on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing on September 15, 2017. Additionally, in the first quarter of fiscal 2017, our $400 million of 0.875% Senior Notes (the “2016 notes”) were repaid.See Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.The indentures under which all of our Senior Notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of October 1, 2017, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of CashWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt, to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures, new product innovations, related marketing support and partner and digital investments, return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses such as Siren Retail. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. As discussed in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, we committed to purchase the remaining 50% ownership interest in our East China joint venture for approximately $1.3 billion. This transaction is expected to close by early calendar year 2018, primarily through the use of cash and investments held in foreign subsidiaries.We believe that future cash flows generated from operations, existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. We consider the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees as of October 1, 2017 to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no U.S. income and foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need to, repatriate funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs; however, in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our foreign cash to the U.S., we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, which could be material. We do not believe it is practicable to calculate the potential tax impact of repatriation, as there is a significant amount of uncertainty around the calculation, including the availability and amount of foreign tax credits at the time of repatriation, tax rates in effect and other indirect tax consequences associated with repatriation.During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.20 per share. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2017 we declared and paid a cash dividend of $0.25 per share. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2017 and 2016 totaled $1,450.4 million and $1,178.0 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share to be paid on December 1, 2017 with an expected payout of approximately $429.5 million.During fiscal years 2017 and 2016, we repurchased 37.5 million and 34.9 million shares of common stock, respectively, or $2.1 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively, under our ongoing share repurchase program. At October 1, 2017, the number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase under our ongoing share repurchase program totaled 80.3 million. 39Table of ContentsOther than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2018 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores, our developing Siren Retail business and our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2018 are expected to be approximately $2 billion.Cash FlowsCash provided by operating activities was $4.2 billion for fiscal 2017, compared to $4.6 billion for fiscal 2016. The change was primarily due to the timing of our cash payments for income taxes.Cash used by investing activities totaled $0.9 billion for fiscal 2017, compared to $2.2 billion for fiscal 2016. The change was primarily due to the liquidation of a significant portion of our offshore investment portfolio in anticipation of the acquisition of the remaining 50% ownership share of our East China joint venture.Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2017 totaled $3.0 billion, compared to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2016. The change was primarily due to lower proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, the repayment of the 2016 notes and an increase in cash returned to shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of October 1, 2017, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (1)Total Less than 1Year 1 - 3Years 3 - 5Years More than5 YearsOperating lease obligations(2)$8,613.5 $1,213.1 $2,210.2 $1,875.0 $3,315.2Financing lease obligations59.1 4.1 8.2 7.9 38.9Debt obligations Principal payments3,955.3 — 350.0 1,250.0 2,355.3Interest payments868.9 83.6 185.6 172.9 426.8Purchase obligations(3)1,310.1 848.1 380.1 73.6 8.3Other obligations(4)134.7 20.3 28.1 18.8 67.5Total$14,941.6 $2,169.2 $3,162.2 $3,398.2 $6,212.0(1) Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions for which we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments were excluded. As of October 1, 2017, we excluded $207.3 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, which includes accrued interest and penalties. (2) Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses.(3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 91% of total purchase obligations.(4) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations and hedging instruments.Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONSCommodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.40Table of ContentsFINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. Excluding interest rate swaps, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.Commodity Price RiskWe purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 1, 2017 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying RateCommodity hedges$6 $(6) $— $—Foreign Currency Exchange RiskThe majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, Chinese renminbi, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 1, 2017 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates.

Trading securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of October 1, 2017 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.41Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskLong-term DebtWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of October 1, 2017.The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of October 1, 2017 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): Change in Fair Value Stated Interest Rate Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying Rate 2018 notes2.000% $352 $(4) $42021 notes2.100% $751 $(24) $242022 notes2.700% $508 $(22) $222023 notes(1)3.850% $806 $— $—2024 notes0.372% $760 $(47) $472026 notes2.450% $481 $(37) $372045 notes4.300% $381 $(63) $63(1) Amount disclosed is net of ($42 million) change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap. Refer to Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge.Available-for-Sale SecuritiesOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for-sale securities. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of October 1, 2017 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESCritical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past four fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.42Table of ContentsProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived AssetsWe evaluate property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. During fiscal 2017, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions, aside from those related to the long-term strategy assumptions of our Teavana-branded retail stores, which had a significant impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our 43Table of Contentsability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.The partial goodwill impairments of the Teavana and Switzerland reporting units are discussed in Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. Changes in tax laws and rates may affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities and our effective tax rate in the future; however, we do not expect changes from recently enacted tax laws to be material to the consolidated financial statements.In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that has not been subject to U.S. income taxes. We intend to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to additional U.S. income taxes, which could be material. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on these earnings is not practicable because such liability, if any, is dependent on circumstances existing if and when remittance occurs.Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. 44Table of ContentsItem 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Commodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Report.45Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:46:19.409919
829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2018,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGeneralOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal years ended on September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017 included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended on October 2, 2016 included 53 weeks, with the extra week falling in our fourth fiscal quarter. Comparable store sales percentages for fiscal 2016 are calculated excluding the 53rd week. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.Financial Highlights•Total net revenues increased 10% to $24.7 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $22.4 billion in fiscal 2017. •Global comparable store sales grew 2% driven by a 3% increase in average ticket. •Consolidated operating income decreased to $3.9 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to operating income of $4.1 billion in fiscal 2017. Fiscal 2018 operating margin was 15.7% compared to 18.5% in fiscal 2017. Operating margin compression in fiscal 2018 was primarily driven by food and beverage-related mix shifts, largely in the Americas segment, the impact of our ownership change in East China at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, higher restructuring and impairment costs and higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations. •Restructuring and impairment charges increased to $224 million in fiscal 2018 compared to $154 million in fiscal 2017. Increased costs were primarily related to higher asset impairments associated with the decision to close certain Starbucks® company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada, higher goodwill impairment charges related to our Switzerland retail reporting unit and EMEA restructuring costs. •Earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2018 increased to $3.24, compared to EPS of $1.97 in fiscal 2017. The increase was primarily driven by the gains from the acquisition of our East China joint venture and the sale of our Tazo brand. Additionally, the net favorable impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) also contributed to the increase. •Cash flows from operations were $11.9 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $4.3 billion in fiscal 2017. The change was primarily due to receipt of the upfront payment from Nestlé related to the Global Coffee Alliance.•Capital expenditures were $2.0 billion in fiscal 2018 compared to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2017.•We returned $8.9 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2018 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2017.OverviewStarbucks results for fiscal 2018 reflect the impact of certain restructuring and streamlining efforts, beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, to focus on accelerating growth in high-returning businesses and removing non-core, slow growth activities. These efforts primarily include the acquisition of our East China joint venture, the conversion of our Singapore, Taiwan and Brazil operations to licensed models, the closure of TeavanaTM/MC retail stores, the sale of the Tazo brand, the licensing of our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé, and the closure of certain company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada, among other actions. These streamlining efforts span across all segments and our corporate functions.On August 26, 2018, our Channel Development segment finalized licensing and distribution agreements with Nestlé to sell and market our CPG and foodservice products. The scope of the arrangement converts the majority of our previously defined Channel Development segment operations, as well as certain smaller businesses previously reported in the Americas, EMEA and Corporate and Other (previously All Other Segment), from company-owned to licensed operations with Nestlé. As a result, we realigned our organizational and operating segment structures in support of the newly established Global Coffee Alliance. Our reportable segments have been restated as if those smaller businesses were previously within our Channel Development segment.Concurrent with the change in reportable operating segments, we revised our prior period financial information to reflect comparable financial information for the new segment structure. Further, in an effort to report operating expenses in line with the corresponding revenue generating activities, we have changed the classification of certain costs, primarily within our CAP segment and mainly from other operating expenses to general and administrative expenses. This reclassification has been retrospectively applied and was determined to be immaterial.Starbucks largest acquisition to date affects our CAP segment. As a result of acquiring the remaining interest in our East China joint venture at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we began recording 100% of its revenues and expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2018. This is in contrast with our previous joint venture model, where we recorded only revenues and expenses from products sales to and royalties received from East China, as well as our proportionate share of the joint venture's net profit. The change from equity method to consolidation 25Table of Contentsmethod lowered the operating margin of our Consolidated and CAP segment, primarily due to incremental depreciation and amortization expenses and lower income from equity investees. Starbucks results for fiscal 2018 continued to demonstrate the strength of our global business model and our ability to successfully make disciplined investments in our business and our partners. Consolidated total net revenues increased 10% to $24.7 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 1,997 net new store openings over the past 12 months, incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in East China, 2% growth in global comparable store sales and favorable foreign currency translation. These increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the closure of our TeavanaTM/MC retail stores, initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and substantially ceased during fiscal 2018 and the sale of our Singapore retail operations to a licensed partner in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Consolidated operating income declined $251 million, or 6%, to $3.9 billion. Operating margin declined 280 basis points to 15.7%, primarily due to food and beverage-related mix shifts, largely in the Americas segment, the impact of our ownership change in East China, higher restructuring and impairment costs and higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations. Earnings per share of $3.24 increased 64% over the prior year earnings per share of $1.97.Americas revenue grew by 7% to $16.7 billion, primarily driven by incremental revenues from 895 net new store openings over the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 2%, partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the conversion of our Brazil retail business to fully licensed operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Operating income declined $39 million to $3.6 billion and operating margin of 21.6% declined 180 basis points from a year ago, primarily due to food and beverage-related mix shifts, increased investments in our store partners and the impact of the May 29th anti-bias training. These increases were partially offset by sales leverage. In our CAP segment, revenue grew by 38% to $4.5 billion, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in East China at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018, incremental revenues from 756 net new stores over the past 12 months. These increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue related to the sale of our Singapore retail operations to fully licensed operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017. Operating income grew 13% to $867 million, while operating margin declined 420 basis points to 19.4%, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China. We now operate 8,530 stores in 15 markets in our CAP segment making this our second largest reportable segment.In our EMEA segment, revenue grew by 9% to $1.0 billion, primarily driven by increased revenues from the opening of 356 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months and favorable foreign currency translation. Operating margin declined 400 basis points to 5.9% primarily due to higher impairment of goodwill related to our Switzerland retail business and restructuring costs, including severance, asset impairments and business process optimization expenses. These decreases were partially offset by lapping of a prior year tax settlement.Channel Development segment revenues grew by 2% to $2.3 billion, primarily driven by increased sales of packaged coffee and premium single-serve products, lapping a prior year revenue deduction adjustment and favorable foreign currency translation. These increases were partially offset by the net impact from the sale of our Tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and licensing our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé beginning on August 26, 2018. Operating income declined $40 million, or 4%, to $927 million. Operating margin declined 250 basis points to 40.4%, primarily driven by business taxes associated with the upfront payment received from Nestlé, Global Coffee Alliance headcount related costs, including employee bonus and retention costs, and the impact of our ownership changes, including licensing our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé and the sale of our Tazo brand. Fiscal 2019 — The View AheadTurning to fiscal 2019, we expect continued growth through thoughtful long-term investments that create value and reward shareholders. These results are expected to be driven by our three strategic priorities, which include:•Accelerate growth in our targeted, long-term growth markets of the U.S. and China•Expand the global reach of the Starbucks brand leveraging the Global Coffee Alliance•Sharpen our focus on increasing shareholder returnsTo successfully achieve these priorities, we will undertake a number of initiatives, including growing our core business in the U.S. through enhancement of the in-store experience, delivery of customer-relevant beverage innovation and digital relationships, and growing our business in China through new store expansion, comparable store sales and business partnerships. Further, we will continue expanding the reach of the Starbucks brand through retail market realignment, including our plans to license the France, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg markets, business simplification and the Global Coffee Alliance. These additional streamlining initiatives will enable us to amplify our focus and resources on core value drivers with the greatest prospect for returns. We expect moderate revenue growth in fiscal 2019, reflecting implementation of our streamlining activities and driven by comparable store sales growth and the opening of approximately 2,100 net new stores globally.26Table of ContentsConsolidated operating margin is expected to decrease slightly in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018, and our effective tax rate is expected to increase slightly from fiscal 2018. While GAAP full-year diluted earnings per share is expected to decrease in fiscal 2019, full-year non-GAAP diluted earnings per share is expected to grow when excluding gains from acquisitions and divestitures in fiscal 2018, integration costs related to East China and Japan and restructuring and impairment expenses.Capital expenditures in fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately $2.0 billion, primarily related to our retail portfolio including investments in our new and existing stores and strategic store-related initiatives.Acquisitions and DivestituresSee Note 2, Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.27Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2017 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):RevenuesFiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 %ChangeNet revenues: Company-operated stores$19,690.3 $17,650.7 11.6 %Licensed stores2,652.2 2,355.0 12.6Other 2,377.0 2,381.1 (0.2)Total net revenues$24,719.5 $22,386.8 10.4 %Total net revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 10%, over fiscal 2017, primarily driven by increased revenues from company-operated stores ($2.0 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 816 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($904 million), incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in East China ($903 million) and a 2% increase in comparable store sales ($345 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket. Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($297 million), primarily due to increased product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($298 million), largely due to the opening of 1,181 net new Starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months, the conversions of both the Singapore and Taiwan markets to fully licensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and the first quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively ($44 million). These increases were partially offset by the impact of our ownership change in East China at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($53 million).Other revenues decreased $4 million, primarily driven by the absence of revenue from the sale of our Tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($56 million), the closure of our e-commerce business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($51 million) and licensing our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 ($50 million). Partially offsetting these decreases were increased sales of packaged coffee and premium single-serve products ($115 million).

Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues decreased 30 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 60 basis points).Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 60 basis points).28Table of ContentsGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations (approximately 20 basis points) and the 2018 U.S. stock award (approximately 20 basis points).Restructuring and impairment expenses increased $71 million, primarily due to higher asset impairments associated with the decision to close certain company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada ($23 million), higher goodwill impairment charges associated with our Switzerland company-operated retail reporting unit ($20 million) and EMEA restructuring costs, including severance and asset impairments ($18 million).Income from equity investees decreased $90 million, primarily due to the impact of ownership changes in our East China and Taiwan joint ventures, partially offset by higher South Korea joint venture income.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 280 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.Other Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 As a % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income$3,883.3 $4,134.7 15.7 % 18.5 %Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture1,376.4 — 5.6 —Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations 499.2 93.5 2.0 0.4Interest income and other, net191.4 181.8 0.8 0.8Interest expense(170.3) (92.5) (0.7) (0.4)Earnings before income taxes5,780.0 4,317.5 23.4 19.3Income tax expense1,262.0 1,432.6 5.1 6.4Net earnings including noncontrolling interests4,518.0 2,884.9 18.3 12.9Net earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests(0.3) 0.2 — —Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$4,518.3 $2,884.7 18.3 % 12.9 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 21.8 % 33.2 %Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50% ownership interest in our East China joint venture to fair value upon acquisition.Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations primarily consists of sales of our Tazo brand and Taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our Brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018. The gain in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the sale of our Singapore retail operations.Interest income and other, net increased $10 million, primarily due to recognizing higher income on unredeemed stored value card balances, partially offset by lapping the gain on the sale of our investment in Square, Inc. warrants in the prior year period. Interest expense increased $78 million primarily related to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in November 2017, March 2018 and August 2018. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 21.8% compared to 33.2% for fiscal 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture that is not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the Tax Act (approximately 480 basis points). The impact from the Tax Act primarily included favorability from the lower corporate income tax rate applied to our fiscal 2018 results (approximately 760 basis points) and the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities (approximately 130 basis points). This favorability was partially offset by the estimated transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings (approximately 400 basis points).

Restructuring and impairment charges increased $29 million due to higher asset impairments in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017 associated with the decision to close certain U.S. company-operated stores ($23 million) and costs associated with the closure of certain company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada ($6 million) in fiscal 2018.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 180 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.30Table of ContentsCAPFiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 As a % of China/Asia Pacific Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$4,096.9 $2,906.0 91.6% 89.7%Licensed stores365.7 327.4 8.2 10.1Other11.0 6.8 0.2 0.2Total net revenues4,473.6 3,240.2 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs1,898.3 1,396.2 42.4 43.1Store operating expenses1,148.7 845.5 25.7 26.1Other operating expenses22.9 21.2 0.5 0.7Depreciation and amortization expenses412.1 202.2 9.2 6.2General and administrative expenses241.6 207.1 5.4 6.4Total operating expenses3,723.6 2,672.2 83.2 82.5Income from equity investees117.4 197.0 2.6 6.1Operating income$867.4 $765.0 19.4% 23.6%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 28.0% 29.1%Other operating expenses as a % of non-company-operated store revenues 6.1% 6.3%Discussion of our China/Asia Pacific segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating our East China business due to the ownership change from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of December 31, 2017. Under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product cost of sales as well as our proportionate share of East China's net earnings, which we recognized within income from equity investees. This resulted in a higher operating margin. Under the company-operated ownership model, East China’s operating results are reflected in most income statement lines of this segment.RevenuesChina/Asia Pacific total net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased $1.2 billion, or 38%, over fiscal 2017, primarily driven by higher company-operated store revenues ($1.2 billion) due to the impact of our ownership change in East China ($903 million) and incremental revenues from 443 net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($300 million). Also contributing were favorable foreign currency translation ($82 million) and a 1% increase in comparable store sales ($26 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the conversion of our Singapore retail business to fully licensed operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($121 million).Licensed store revenues increased $38 million, primarily driven by increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($44 million), primarily resulting from the opening of 313 net new licensed stores over the past 12 months, the conversion of our Taiwan joint venture to fully licensed operations at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($25 million) and the conversion of our Singapore retail operations to fully licensed operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($20 million). These increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue from our ownership change in East China ($53 million).Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily due to the ownership change in East China (approximately 60 basis points).Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 40 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses decreased 110 basis points, primarily due to the ownership change in East China (approximately 90 basis points).General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased 100 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage on salaries and benefits (approximately 50 basis points) and the impact of ownership change in East China (approximately 30 basis points).Income from equity investees decreased $80 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership changes in East China and Taiwan joint ventures, partially offset by higher South Korea joint venture income.31Table of ContentsThe combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 420 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.EMEAFiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 As a % of EMEA Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$575.6 $551.0 54.9% 57.5%Licensed stores471.3 407.7 45.0 42.5Other 1.1 — 0.1 —Total net revenues1,048.0 958.7 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs559.2 508.6 53.4 53.1Store operating expenses226.0 214.1 21.6 22.3Other operating expenses62.8 51.3 6.0 5.4Depreciation and amortization expenses31.7 30.6 3.0 3.2General and administrative expenses51.7 41.7 4.9 4.3Restructuring and impairments55.1 17.9 5.3 1.9Total operating expenses986.5 864.2 94.1 90.1Operating income$61.5 $94.5 5.9% 9.9%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 39.3% 38.9%Other operating expenses as a % of non-company-operated store 13.3% 12.6%RevenuesEMEA total net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased $89 million, or 9%, over fiscal 2017, primarily due to higher revenue from licensed stores ($64 million) and company-operated stores ($25 million).

As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses increased 40 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage on salaries and benefits, largely due to increased minimum wage in certain markets (approximately 140 basis points), partially offset by lapping a prior year tax settlement (approximately 100 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 60 basis points. Excluding the impact of company-operated store revenues, other operating expenses increased 70 basis points, primarily due to business process optimization expenses (approximately 60 basis points).General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily due to business process optimization expenses (approximately 50 basis points). Restructuring and impairment expenses increased $37 million, primarily due to higher goodwill impairment expense associated with our Switzerland retail reporting unit in fiscal 2018 than in the prior year period ($20 million) and EMEA restructuring costs, including severance and asset impairments ($18 million).The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 400 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.32Table of ContentsChannel DevelopmentFiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 As a % of Channel Development Total Net RevenuesNet revenues$2,297.3 $2,256.6 Cost of sales1,252.3 1,209.3 54.5 53.6Other operating expenses286.5 260.4 12.5 11.5Depreciation and amortization expenses1.3 3.0 0.1 0.1General and administrative expenses13.9 11.3 0.6 0.5Total operating expenses1,554.0 1,484.0 67.6 65.8Income from equity investees183.8 194.4 8.0 8.6Operating income$927.1 $967.0 40.4% 42.9%Discussion of our Channel Development segment results reflect the impact of the licensing of our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé, the sale of Tazo and an immaterial, unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we licensed our CPG (Starbucks-, Starbucks Reserve-, Teavana-, Seattle's Best Coffee-, Starbucks VIA- and Torrefazione Italia-branded packaged coffee and tea) and foodservice businesses to Nestlé and formed a Global Coffee Alliance. Eleven months of fiscal 2018 results reflect our CPG and foodservice businesses as company-owned and one month as licensed operations. Our collaborative business relationships for our global ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the Global Coffee Alliance.RevenuesChannel Development net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased $41 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2017. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in sales of our packaged coffee and premium single-serve products ($115 million), lapping a prior year revenue deduction adjustment ($13 million) and favorable foreign currency translation ($10 million). These increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue from the sale of our Tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($56 million) and licensing our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 ($50 million).Operating ExpensesCost of sales as a percentage of total net revenues increased 90 basis points, primarily driven by the impact of licensing our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé and the sale of our Tazo brand (approximately 120 basis points), partially offset by lapping a revenue deduction adjustment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 (approximately 30 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 100 basis points, primarily driven by business taxes associated with the upfront payment received from Nestlé (approximately 120 basis points) and Global Coffee Alliance headcount-related costs, including employee bonus and retention costs (approximately 80 basis points). These increases were partially offset by the cost savings related to our ownership changes, including licensing our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé and the sale of our Tazo brand (approximately 40 basis points), and lower marketing expenses (approximately 40 basis points).Income from equity investees decreased $11 million for fiscal 2018, due to lower income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, driven by decreased sales of Frappuccino®, Starbucks Doubleshot® and Iced Coffee beverages.The combination of these changes contributed to an overall decrease in operating margin of 250 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.33Table of ContentsCorporate and OtherFiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 % ChangeNet revenues: Company-operated stores$112.7 $197.3 (42.9)%Licensed stores1.2 2.6 (53.8)Other 54.5 111.4 (51.1)Total net revenues168.4 311.3 (45.9)Cost of sales including occupancy costs163.5 225.2 (27.4)Store operating expenses70.6 113.5 (37.8)Other operating expenses17.1 36.6 (53.3)Depreciation and amortization expenses163.6 160.7 1.8General and administrative expenses1,204.8 989.2 21.8Restructuring and impairments135.9 131.5 3.3Total operating expenses1,755.5 1,656.7 6.0Operating loss$(1,587.1) $(1,345.4) 18.0 %Corporate and Other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses, the results from Siren Retail, as well as Evolution Fresh and the legacy operations of the Teavana retail business, which substantially ceased during fiscal 2018.

The growth in company-operated store revenues was primarily driven by incremental revenues from 768 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($869 million) and a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($496 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket. Partially offsetting these incremental revenues was the absence of the 53rd week ($324 million), the absence of sales from the conversion of certain company operated stores to licensed stores ($121 million) and the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($70 million).Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenue ($201 million), primarily due to increased product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($260 million), largely due to the opening of 1,552 net new Starbucks® licensed stores and improved comparable store sales, partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($41 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation ($27 million).Other revenues increased $64 million, primarily driven by increased sales of packaged coffee, tea and premium single-serve products ($73 million), our ready-to-drink beverages ($21 million) and higher foodservice sales ($26 million).

Excluding the impact of company operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 60 basis points, primarily due to lower performance-based compensation (approximately 20 basis points).General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 10 basis points, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation (approximately 30 basis points), and employment taxes, including the lapping of higher employment taxes resulting from a multiple year audit in the prior year (approximately 20 basis points). These were partially offset by increased salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations.Restructuring and impairments charges in fiscal 2017 were primarily the result of our strategic changes in Teavana. We recorded $130 million of restructuring–related costs, including a partial goodwill impairment charge of $69 million, store asset impairments, and costs related to early store closure obligations and severance. Additionally, we recorded $18 million of partial goodwill impairment relating to our Switzerland retail business.Income from equity investees increased $73 million, due to higher income from our CAP joint venture operations, primarily China and South Korea, as well as our North American Coffee Partnership.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 110 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016.35Table of ContentsOther Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedOct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 Oct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 (52 Weeks Ended) (53 Weeks Ended) As a % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income$4,134.7 $4,171.9 18.5 % 19.6Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations93.5 5.4 0.4 —Interest income and other, net181.8 102.6 0.8 0.5Interest expense(92.5) (81.3) (0.4) (0.4)Earnings before income taxes4,317.5 4,198.6 19.3 19.7Income tax expense1,432.6 1,379.7 6.4 6.5Net earnings including noncontrolling interests2,884.9 2,818.9 12.9 13.2Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests0.2 1.2 — —Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$2,884.7 $2,817.7 12.9 % 13.2 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 33.2 % 32.9 %Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations increased $88 million, primarily due to the gain from the sale of our Singapore retail operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($84 million). Interest income and other, net increased $79 million, primarily driven by gain in our investment in Square, Inc. warrants ($41 million) and higher income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances ($44 million).Interest expense increased $11 million primarily related to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in February 2016, May 2016 and March 2017, partially offset by lower interest expense from the repayment of our December 2016 notes.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2017 was 33.2% compared to 32.9% for fiscal 2016. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to unfavorability from non-deductible goodwill impairment charges recorded in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 (approximately 70 basis points) and the lapping of the release of certain tax reserves in the third quarter of fiscal 2016, primarily related to statute closures (approximately 30 basis points).

Favorability in both regions was attributable to comparable store sales growth and the addition of net new licensed stores over the past 12 months. East China also benefited from the new value added tax structure.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 210 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016.38Table of ContentsEMEAFiscal Year EndedOct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 Oct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 (52 Weeks Ended) (53 Weeks Ended) As a % of EMEA Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$551.0 $732.0 57.5% 68.3%Licensed stores407.7 339.5 42.5 31.7Total net revenues958.7 1,071.5 100.0 100.0Cost of sales including occupancy costs508.6 540.7 53.1 50.5Store operating expenses214.1 260.6 22.3 24.3Other operating expenses51.3 49.4 5.4 4.6Depreciation and amortization expenses30.6 39.9 3.2 3.7General and administrative expenses41.7 51.4 4.3 4.8Restructuring and impairments17.9 — 1.9 —Total operating expenses864.2 942.0 90.1 87.9Income from equity investees— 1.5 — 0.1Operating income$94.5 $131.0 9.9% 12.2%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 38.9% 35.6%Other operating expenses as a % of non-company-operated store revenues 12.6% 14.6%RevenuesEMEA total net revenues for fiscal 2017 decreased $113 million, or 11%, over fiscal 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a decline in company-operated store revenues ($181 million), driven by the shift to more licensed stores in the region ($121 million), which includes the absence of revenues related to the sale of our Germany retail operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Also contributing to the decline was unfavorable foreign currency translation ($43 million) and the absence of the 53rd week ($11 million).Licensed store revenues increased $68 million, driven by higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($95 million), resulting from the opening of 339 net new licensed stores and the transfer of 14 company-operated stores to licensed stores over the past 12 months. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($24 million) and the absence of the 53rd week ($6 million).Operating ExpensesCost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 260 basis points, primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency transactions (approximately 150 basis points) and the shift in the composition of our store portfolio to more licensed stores, which have a lower gross margin (approximately 100 basis points).Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 200 basis points. As a percentage of company-operated store revenues, store operating expenses increased 330 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage in certain company-operated stores (approximately 320 basis points) and the impact of a tax settlement (approximately 100 basis points), partially offset by the shift in the portfolio towards more licensed stores (approximately 140 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 80 basis points. Excluding the impact of company operated store revenues, other operating expenses decreased 200 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage driven by the shift to more licensed stores (approximately 160 basis points).Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 50 basis points, primarily due to the shift in portfolio towards more licensed stores (approximately 50 basis points).Restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal 2017 relate to a partial goodwill impairment expense recorded in our Switzerland company-operated retail reporting unit, which we fully acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. The overall economic backdrop in Europe, coupled with the strengthening of the Swiss franc when compared to the relatively inexpensive euro in surrounding countries, caused ongoing unfavorable changes in consumer behavior and depressed tourism. Our latest mitigation efforts for our Switzerland retail business are not expected to fully recover the reporting unit's carrying value given 39Table of Contentsthe sustained nature of these and other external factors. As a result, we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $18 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2017.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 230 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016.Channel DevelopmentFiscal Year EndedOct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 Oct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 (52 Weeks Ended) (53 Weeks Ended) As a % of Channel Development Total Net RevenuesTotal net revenues$2,256.6 $2,195.1 Cost of sales1,209.3 1,191.8 53.6 54.3Other operating expenses260.4 270.7 11.5 12.3Depreciation and amortization expenses3.0 3.9 0.1 0.2General and administrative expenses11.3 18.0 0.5 0.8Total operating expenses1,484.0 1,484.4 65.8 67.6Income from equity investees194.4 166.6 8.6 7.6Operating income$967.0 $877.3 42.9% 40.0%Discussion of our Channel Development segment results reflects the impact of an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. While this adjustment was immaterial, the discussion below quantifies the impact to provide a better understanding of our results for fiscal 2017.RevenuesChannel Development total net revenues for fiscal 2017 increased $62 million, or 3%, over fiscal 2016. Revenue growth was driven by increased sales of packaged coffee, tea and premium single-serve products ($73 million), our ready-to-drink beverages ($21 million) and higher foodservice sales ($26 million). Higher foodservice sales were primarily the result of a change to a direct distribution model and recognizing the benefit of full revenue from premium single-serve product sales. Increased sales were partially offset by the absence of the 53rd week ($45 million) and an unfavorable revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to prior periods ($13 million).Operating ExpensesCost of sales as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily driven by lower coffee costs (approximately 80 basis points) and leverage on cost of sales (approximately 60 basis points), partially offset by a shift toward lower margin products (approximately 80 basis points) and the revenue deduction adjustment pertaining to prior periods (approximately 30 basis points).Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 80 basis points, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation (approximately 40 basis points).General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 30 basis points, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation (approximately 20 basis points) and salaries and benefits (approximately 10 basis points).Income from equity investees increased $28 million for fiscal 2017, due to higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture, driven by increased sales of Frappuccino® and Starbucks Doubleshot® beverages as well as new product launches over the past 12 months.The combination of these changes contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 290 basis points in fiscal 2017 when compared to fiscal 2016.40Table of ContentsCorporate and OtherFiscal Year EndedOct 1, 2017 Oct 2, 2016 %Change (52 Weeks Ended) (53 Weeks Ended) Net revenues: Company-operated stores$197.3 $224.3 (12.0)%Licensed stores2.6 3.9 (33.3)%Other111.4 107.1 4.0Total net revenues311.3 335.3 (7.2)Cost of sales including occupancy costs225.2 223.4 0.8Store operating expenses113.5 115.0 (1.3)Other operating expenses36.6 57.8 (36.7)Depreciation and amortization expenses160.7 166.4 (3.4)General and administrative expenses989.2 979.2 1.0Restructuring and impairments131.5 — nmTotal operating expenses1,656.7 1,541.8 7.5Operating loss$(1,345.4) $(1,206.5) 11.5 %Corporate and Other includes the results of our Teavana, Siren Retail, Evolution Fresh and our unallocated corporate expenses. Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.The increase in the operating loss in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016 was primarily due to restructuring and impairment charges related to our strategy to close TeavanaTM/MC retail stores and focus on TeavanaTM/MC tea within Starbucks® stores. We recorded $69 million for the partial impairment of goodwill and $60 million in restructuring-related costs, including asset impairments, costs associated with the early closure of stores and their related obligations, and severance. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash and Investment OverviewOur cash and investments were $9.2 billion and $3.2 billion as of September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017, respectively with the increase driven primarily by the upfront payment associated with the Global Coffee Alliance. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign), mortgage and asset-backed securities, commercial paper, and agency obligations. As of September 30, 2018, approximately $1.3 billion of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing capacityOur $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the “2018 credit facility”) and our $1.0 billion unsecured 364-Day credit facility (the “364-day credit facility”) are available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases.The 2018 credit facility, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on October 25, 2022. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the five-year credit agreement. The current applicable margin is 0.680% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.00% (nil) for Base Rate Loans. The 364-day credit facility, of which no amount may be used for issuances of letters of credit, was originally set to mature on October 25, 2018. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the maturity has been extended to October 23, 2019. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-41Table of Contentsdenominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin was increased from 0.585% to 0.92% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.00% (nil) for Base Rate Loans as a result of the extension.Both credit facilities contain provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all applicable credit facility covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of September 30, 2018.Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facilities discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of September 30, 2018, we had no borrowings under our commercial paper program. In August 2018, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $1.25 billion of 7-year 3.800% Senior Notes (the “2025 notes”) due August 2025, $750 million of 10-year 4.000% Senior Notes (the “2028 notes”) due November 2028 and $1 billion of 30-year 4.500% Senior Notes (the “2048 notes”) due November 2048. Interest on the 2025 notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing on February 15, 2019. Interest on the 2028 and 2048 notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15, commencing on November 15, 2018.In February 2018, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $1 billion of 5-year 3.100% Senior Notes (the “2023 notes”) due March 2023 and $600 million of 10-year 3.500% Senior Notes (the “2028 notes”) due March 2028. Interest on the 2023 and 2028 notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1, commencing on September 1, 2018.In November 2017, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 3-year 2.200% Senior Notes (the “2020 notes”) due November 2020 and $500 million of 30-year 3.750% Senior Notes (the “2047 notes”) due December 2047. Interest on the 2020 notes is payable semi-annually on May 22 and November 22, commencing on May 22, 2018 and interest on the 2047 notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1, commencing on June 1, 2018. The net proceeds from these offerings are used for general corporate purposes, including repurchases of our common stock under our ongoing share repurchase program and payment of dividends. See Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.The indentures under which all of our Senior Notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 30, 2018, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of CashWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt, to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures, new product innovations, related marketing support and partner and digital investments, return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core and other developing businesses. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as any shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.We have historically considered the majority of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries and equity investees to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no foreign withholding taxes have been provided on such earnings. We continue to 42Table of Contentsevaluate our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and thus have not adjusted our previous indefinite reinvestment assertions for the effects of the Tax Act. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need for, repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. However, the Tax Act requires a one-time transition tax for deemed repatriation of accumulated undistributed earnings of certain foreign investments. This one-time transition tax is payable over eight years, with most of the cash outlay expected to be made in the later years. In connection with our initial analysis, we have estimated a provisional amount of $262 million, of which $237 million of income taxes payable was included in other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet, as of September 30, 2018. See Note 13, Income Taxes, for further discussion. We regularly review our cash positions and our determination of permanent reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, beyond the Tax Act's one-time transition tax, which could be material. During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2017, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.25 per share. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2018, we declared a cash dividend of $0.30 per share, and we declared $0.36 per share in the last two quarters of fiscal 2018. Dividends are paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2018 and 2017 totaled $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we declared a cash dividend of $0.36 per share to be paid on November 30, 2018 with an expected payout of approximately $445 million.During fiscal years 2018 and 2017, we repurchased 131.5 million and 37.5 million shares of common stock, respectively, or $7.2 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, under our ongoing share repurchase program. In early fiscal 2019, we commenced the repurchase of $5.0 billion of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase agreements. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2019 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores, our developing Siren Retail business and our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2019 are expected to be approximately $2 billion.Cash FlowsCash provided by operating activities was $11.9 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $4.3 billion for fiscal 2017. The change was primarily due to receipt of the upfront payment from Nestlé in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.Cash used by investing activities totaled $2.4 billion for fiscal 2018, compared to $0.9 billion for fiscal 2017. The change was primarily due to cash used to acquire the 50% ownership interest in our East China joint venture in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and additions to property, plant and equipment driven by new store openings and increased store renovations, partially offset by the net proceeds from the divestiture of certain operations.Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2018 totaled $3.2 billion, compared to $3.1 billion for fiscal 2017. The change was primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholders through share repurchases and dividend payments, partially offset by higher proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt.43Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 30, 2018, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (1)Total Less than 1Year 1 - 3Years 3 - 5Years More than5 YearsOperating lease obligations(2)$9,353.8 $1,340.6 $2,463.4 $2,045.4 $3,504.4Financing lease obligations58.0 4.4 8.7 8.3 36.6Debt obligations Principal payments9,548.4 350.0 1,250.0 1,500.0 6,448.4Interest payments3,698.0 278.9 586.0 488.0 2,345.1Purchase obligations(3)1,267.1 806.6 342.9 101.0 16.6Other obligations(4)417.7 31.0 64.3 98.8 223.6Total$24,343.0 $2,811.5 $4,715.3 $4,241.5 $12,574.7(1) We have excluded long-term gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties of $237.2 million from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain.

We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. Excluding interest rate swaps, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.44Table of ContentsCommodity Price RiskWe purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 30, 2018 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices.

However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 30, 2018 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates.

Trading securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of September 30, 2018 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.45Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskLong-term DebtWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of September 30, 2018.The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of September 30, 2018 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): Change in Fair Value Stated Interest Rate Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying Rate 2018 notes2.000% $350 $(1) $12020 notes2.200% $490 $(10) $102021 notes2.100% $733 $(17) $172022 notes2.700% $486 $(17) $172023 notes(1)3.850% $759 $— $—2023 notes3.100% $986 $(40) $402024 notes0.372% $743 $(40) $402025 notes3.800% $1,249 $(74) $742026 notes2.450% $451 $(34) $342028 notes3.500% $576 $(47) $472028 notes4.000% $754 $(61) $612045 notes4.300% $330 $(53) $532047 notes3.750% $438 $(81) $812048 notes4.500% $977 $(159) $159(1) Amount disclosed is net of ($32 million) change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap. Refer to Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge.Available-for-Sale SecuritiesOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for-sale securities. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 30, 2018 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESCritical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.46Table of ContentsProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived AssetsWe evaluate property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. During fiscal 2018, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions, aside from those related to the decision to close certain company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada, which had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our 47Table of Contentsability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.The goodwill impairment charges related to the Switzerland reporting unit are discussed in Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional income or withholding taxes. We have historically asserted our intent to reinvest these earnings for the foreseeable future. The Company continues to evaluate its plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings and thus has not adjusted its previous indefinite reinvestment assertions for the effects of the Tax Act. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional income or withholding taxes, which could be material.Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.Refer to Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for additional discussion surrounding the changes as a result of the Tax Act.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.

829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2019,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGeneralOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.OverviewStarbucks results for fiscal 2019 reflect the impacts of continued streamlining efforts, initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, to focus on accelerating growth in high-returning businesses and converting several market operations, including Thailand, France, and the Netherlands, to fully licensed models in fiscal 2019. Additionally, in fiscal 2019, we saw the full impact from the licensing of the majority of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we realigned our operating segment reporting structure to better reflect the cumulative effect of our streamlining efforts. Specifically, our previous China/Asia Pacific (""CAP"") segment and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (""EMEA"") segment have been combined into one International segment. Results of Siren Retail, a non-reportable operating segment consisting of Starbucks ReserveTM Roastery & Tasting Rooms, certain stores under the Starbucks Reserve brand and Princi operations, which were previously included within Corporate and Other, are now reported within the Americas and International segments based on the geographical location of the operations. As a result, we have three reportable operating segments: Americas, International and Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Further, to better support the review of our results, we have changed the classification of certain costs. The most significant change was the reclassification of company-owned store occupancy costs from cost of sales to store operating expenses. We also made certain other immaterial changes. Concurrent with the change in reportable segments and realignment of certain operating expenses noted above, we revised our prior period financial information to be consistent with the current period presentation. There was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income, or net earnings per share as a result of these changes. In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation into law H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. Our U.S. corporate income tax rate for fiscal 2019 and future years is 21%, while a blended rate of 24.5% was applied in fiscal 2018.Financial Highlights•Total net revenues increased 7% to $26.5 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $24.7 billion in fiscal 2018. •Consolidated operating income increased to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to operating income of $3.9 billion in fiscal 2018. Fiscal 2019 operating margin was 15.4% compared to 15.7% in fiscal 2018. Operating margin compression in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by partner (employee) investments and growth in wages and benefits, licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé and other strategic investments. These decreases were partially offset by sales leverage, cost savings initiatives, lower restructuring and impairment costs and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage. •Earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2019 decreased to $2.92, compared to EPS of $3.24 in fiscal 2018. The decrease was primarily driven by lapping the prior year gains from the acquisition of our East China joint venture and the sale of our Tazo brand, partially offset by the gain from the sale of our Thailand retail operations during fiscal 2019. •Capital expenditures were $1.8 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2018.•We returned $12.0 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2019 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $8.9 billion in fiscal 2018.Acquisitions and DivestituresSee Note 2, Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.23Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):RevenuesFiscal Year EndedSep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 %ChangeNet revenues: Company-operated stores$21,544.4 $19,690.3 9.4 %Licensed stores2,875.0 2,652.2 8.4Other 2,089.2 2,377.0 (12.1)Total net revenues$26,508.6 $24,719.5 7.2 %Total net revenues increased $1.8 billion, or 7%, over fiscal 2018, primarily driven by higher revenues from company-operated stores ($1.9 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 947 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($957 million) and a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($879 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($189 million) and the conversion of our Thailand, France, and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($161 million). Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($223 million), primarily due to higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($228 million), largely due to the opening of 992 net new Starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months, and the conversion of our Thailand, France, and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($35 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($41 million). Other revenues decreased $288 million, primarily driven by the licensing of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé. Partially offsetting this decrease was growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with the Global Coffee Alliance.

Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 130 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily driven by investments in our store partners that are funded by savings from the Tax Act and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the Americas segment, partially offset by sales leverage driven by price increases and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage. 24Table of ContentsOther operating expenses decreased $184 million, primarily due to cost savings related to licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé ($176 million) and lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance ($34 million), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestlé and headcount-related costs, primarily relating to employee bonus and retention costs. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 20 basis points).General and administrative expenses increased $116 million, primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation ($89 million) and the 2019 Starbucks Leadership Experience in Chicago, heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter ($52 million).Restructuring and impairment expenses decreased $89 million, primarily due to lower restructuring and impairment costs related to TeavanaTM/MC retail store closures ($128 million) and lower impairments related to our Switzerland retail market ($27 million), partially offset by higher exit costs associated with the closure of certain Starbucks® company-operated stores ($32 million) and severance costs ($25 million). Income from equity investees decreased $3 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership changes in East China. This decrease was partially offset by improved comparable store sales from our joint venture in South Korea and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 30 basis points in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018.Other Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 As a % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income$4,077.9 $3,883.3 15.4 % 15.7 %Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture— 1,376.4 — 5.6Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations 622.8 499.2 2.3 2.0Interest income and other, net96.5 191.4 0.4 0.8Interest expense(331.0) (170.3) (1.2) (0.7)Earnings before income taxes4,466.2 5,780.0 16.8 23.4Income tax expense871.6 1,262.0 3.3 5.1Net earnings including noncontrolling interests3,594.6 4,518.0 13.6 18.3Net earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests(4.6) (0.3) — —Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$3,599.2 $4,518.3 13.6 % 18.3 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 19.5 % 21.8 %Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture in fiscal 2018 was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50% ownership interest in our East China joint venture to fair value upon acquisition.Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations was primarily due to the sale of our Thailand, France and the Netherlands retail operations in fiscal 2019. The gain in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the sale of our Tazo brand and Taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our Brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018. Interest income and other, net decreased $95 million, primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on a prospective basis, which required estimated breakage on unredeemed store value cards to be recorded as revenue. We recorded store value card breakage in interest income and other, net in the prior year.Interest expense increased $161 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in November 2017, March 2018, August 2018 and May 2019.25Table of ContentsThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 19.5% compared to 21.8% for fiscal 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Act (approximately 350 basis points), lapping prior year's transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities (approximately 300 basis points), higher stock-based compensation excess tax benefit (approximately 140 basis points), the release of income tax reserves related to the settlement of a U.S. tax examination and the expiration of statute of limitations (approximately 130 basis points) and the tax impacts of the gain on the sale of our Thailand retail operations (approximately 130 basis points). These favorable impacts were partially offset by the lapping of prior year's gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture that was not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (approximately 170 basis points).

Also contributing were higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($144 million), primarily resulting from comparable store sales growth and the opening of 323 net new Starbucks® licensed stores, or 4% increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage ($119 million). Operating MarginAmericas operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 9% to $3.8 billion, compared to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2018. Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 20.7%, primarily driven by higher partner investments, largely funded by savings from the Tax Act, growth in wages and benefits (approximately 130 basis points) and to a much lesser extent, investments in labor hours heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these were cost savings initiatives, primarily in cost of sales (approximately 90 basis points), the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage (approximately 50 basis points) and sales leverage. 27Table of ContentsInternationalFiscal Year EndedSep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 As a % of International Total Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$5,256.2 $4,702.1 84.9% 84.7%Licensed stores917.0 837.0 14.8 15.1Other17.5 12.1 0.3 0.2Total net revenues6,190.7 5,551.2 100.0 100.0Cost of sales 1,894.9 1,709.4 30.6 30.8Store operating expenses2,428.5 2,182.3 39.2 39.3Other operating expenses116.4 98.9 1.9 1.8Depreciation and amortization expenses511.5 447.6 8.3 8.1General and administrative expenses317.9 302.5 5.1 5.4Restructuring and impairments59.2 55.1 1.0 1.0Total operating expenses5,328.4 4,795.8 86.1 86.4Income from equity investees102.4 117.4 1.7 2.1Operating income$964.7 $872.8 15.6% 15.7%Discussion of our International segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating our East China business from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of December 31, 2017. Under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product cost of sales as well as our proportionate share of East China's net earnings, which resulted in a higher margin business. Under the company-operated ownership model, East China’s operating results are reflected in most income statement lines of this segment. RevenuesInternational total net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased $640 million, or 12%, primarily driven by 665 net new Starbucks® company-operated stores, or a 12% increase, over the past 12 months ($377 million), the ownership change in East China ($280 million) and a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($135 million). Also contributing were increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($84 million), primarily resulting from opening of 669 net new Starbucks® licensed stores, or an 11% increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage ($20 million). These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($183 million) and the conversion of our Thailand, France, and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($126 million). Operating MarginInternational operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 11% to $965 million, compared to $873 million in fiscal 2018. Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 15.6%, primarily driven by strategic investments to support growth in China (approximately 80 basis points) and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 70 basis points), primarily offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 80 basis points) and labor efficiencies (approximately 70 basis points). 28Table of ContentsChannel DevelopmentFiscal Year EndedSep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 As a % of Channel Development Total Net RevenuesNet revenues$1,992.6 $2,297.3 Cost of sales1,390.0 1,252.3 69.8 54.5Other operating expenses76.2 286.5 3.8 12.5Depreciation and amortization expenses13.0 1.3 0.7 0.1General and administrative expenses11.5 13.9 0.6 0.6Total operating expenses1,490.7 1,554.0 74.8 67.6Income from equity investees195.6 183.8 9.8 8.0Operating income$697.5 $927.1 35.0% 40.4%Our Channel Development segment results reflect the impact of the licensing of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which we lapped late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.

The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 816 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($904 million), incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in East China ($903 million) and a 2% increase in comparable store sales ($345 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket.Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($297 million), primarily due to increased product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($298 million), largely due to the opening of 1,181 net new Starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months and the conversions of both the Singapore and Taiwan markets to fully licensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and the first quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively ($44 million). These increases were partially offset by the impact of our ownership change in East China at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($53 million).Other revenues decreased $4 million, primarily driven by the absence of revenue due to the sale of our Tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($56 million), the closure of our e-commerce business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($51 million) and licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 ($50 million). Partially offsetting these decreases were increased sales of packaged coffee and premium single-serve products ($115 million).30Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 As a % of TotalNet RevenuesCost of sales$7,930.7 $7,065.8 32.1% 31.6%Store operating expenses9,472.2 8,486.4 38.3 37.9Other operating expenses554.9 518.0 2.2 2.3Depreciation and amortization expenses1,247.0 1,011.4 5.0 4.5General and administrative expenses1,708.2 1,408.4 6.9 6.3Restructuring and impairments224.4 153.5 0.9 0.7Total operating expenses21,137.4 18,643.5 85.5 83.3Income from equity investees301.2 391.4 1.2 1.7Operating income$3,883.3 $4,134.7 15.7% 18.5%Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 48.1% 48.1%Cost of sales as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to food and beverage-related mix shifts (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the Americas segment, partially offset by the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 40 basis points).Store operating expenses, which include occupancy costs, as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues were flat, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 40 basis points), partially offset by increased partner investments, largely in the Americas segment.Other operating expenses increased $37 million, primarily driven by business taxes associated with the up-front payment received from Nestlé. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 60 basis points).General and administrative expenses increased $300 million, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations and the 2018 U.S. stock award granted in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the Tax Act and vests over one year.Restructuring and impairment expenses increased $71 million, primarily due to higher asset impairments associated with the decision to close certain company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada ($23 million), higher goodwill impairment charges associated with our Switzerland company-operated retail reporting unit ($20 million) and International restructuring costs, including severance and asset impairments ($18 million).Income from equity investees decreased $90 million, primarily due to the impact of ownership changes in our East China and Taiwan joint ventures, partially offset by higher South Korea joint venture income.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 280 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017.31Table of ContentsOther Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 As a % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income$3,883.3 $4,134.7 15.7 % 18.5 %Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture1,376.4 — 5.6 —Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations499.2 93.5 2.0 0.4Interest income and other, net191.4 181.8 0.8 0.8Interest expense(170.3) (92.5) (0.7) (0.4)Earnings before income taxes5,780.0 4,317.5 23.4 19.3Income tax expense1,262.0 1,432.6 5.1 6.4Net earnings including noncontrolling interests4,518.0 2,884.9 18.3 12.9Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests(0.3) 0.2 — —Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$4,518.3 $2,884.7 18.3 % 12.9 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 21.8 % 33.2 %Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50% ownership interest in our East China joint venture to fair value upon acquisition.Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations primarily consisted of sales of our Tazo brand and Taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our Brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018. The gain in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the sale of our Singapore retail operations.Interest income and other, net increased $10 million, primarily due to recognizing higher income on unredeemed stored value card balances, partially offset by the lapping of prior year's gain on the sale of our investment in Square, Inc. warrants in the prior year period.Interest expense increased $78 million primarily related to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in November 2017, March 2018 and August 2018.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 21.8% compared to 33.2% for fiscal 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture that was not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the Tax Act (approximately 480 basis points). The impact from the Tax Act primarily included favorability from the lower corporate income tax rate applied to our fiscal 2018 results (approximately 760 basis points) and the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities (approximately 130 basis points). This favorability was partially offset by the estimated transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings (approximately 400 basis points).

Operating margin decreased 210 basis points to 20.8%, primarily due to food and beverage-related mix shifts (approximately 130 basis points), increased partner investments (approximately 120 basis points) which included incremental investments funded by the Tax Act, increased strategic investments (approximately 30 basis points), the impact of the May 29th anti-bias training (approximately 20 basis points) and higher restructuring costs, including asset impairments and severance (approximately 20 basis points), partially offset by sales leverage.33Table of ContentsInternationalFiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 As a % of InternationalTotal Net RevenuesNet revenues: Company-operated stores$4,702.1 $3,462.5 84.7% 82.4%Licensed stores837.0 735.0 15.1 17.5Other12.1 6.8 0.2 0.2Total net revenues5,551.2 4,204.3 100.0 100.0Cost of sales1,709.4 1,324.2 30.8 31.5Store operating expenses2,182.3 1,664.8 39.3 39.6Other operating expenses98.9 89.2 1.8 2.1Depreciation and amortization expenses447.6 233.2 8.1 5.5General and administrative expenses302.5 236.4 5.4 5.6Restructuring and impairments55.1 17.9 1.0 0.4Total operating expenses4,795.8 3,565.7 86.4 84.8Income from equity investees117.4 197.0 2.1 4.7Operating income$872.8 $835.6 15.7% 19.9%Discussion of our International segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating our East China business from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of December 31, 2017. Under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product cost of sales as well as our proportionate share of East China's net earnings, which resulted in a higher margin business. Under a company-operated ownership model, East China's operating results are reflected in most line items on the statements of earnings.RevenuesInternational total net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased $1.3 billion, or 32%, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in East China ($850 million), 433 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings, or a 12.1% increase, over the past 12 months ($298 million), and favorable foreign currency translation ($121 million). Also contributing were higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($100 million), primarily resulting from the opening of 669 net new Starbucks licensed stores, or a 13.6% increase, over the past 12 months and the conversion of our Taiwan joint venture to fully licensed operations at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($25 million). Operating MarginInternational operating income for fiscal 2018 increased 4% to $872.8 million, compared to $835.6 million in fiscal 2017. Operating margin decreased 420 basis points to 15.7%, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 350 basis points). Also contributing were higher goodwill impairment charges associated with our Switzerland retail reporting unit (approximately 40 basis points) and restructuring costs, including severance and asset impairments (approximately 40 basis points).34Table of ContentsChannel DevelopmentFiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 As a % of Channel DevelopmentTotal Net RevenuesTotal net revenues$2,297.3 $2,256.6 Cost of sales1,252.3 1,209.3 54.5 53.6Other operating expenses286.5 260.4 12.5 11.5Depreciation and amortization expenses1.3 3.0 0.1 0.1General and administrative expenses13.9 11.3 0.6 0.5Total operating expenses1,554.0 1,484.0 67.6 65.8Income from equity investees183.8 194.4 8.0 8.6Operating income$927.1 $967.0 40.4% 42.9%Discussion of our Channel Development segment results reflects the impact of the licensing of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé and the sale of the Tazo brand. Late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we licensed our CPG (Starbucks-, Starbucks Reserve-, Teavana-, Seattle's Best Coffee-, Starbucks VIA- and Torrefazione Italia-branded packaged coffee and tea) and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé and formed the Global Coffee Alliance. Eleven months of fiscal 2018 results reflect our CPG and Foodservice businesses as company-owned and one month as licensed operations. Our collaborative business relationships for our global ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the Global Coffee Alliance.RevenuesChannel Development net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased $41 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2017. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in sales of our packaged coffee and premium single-serve products ($115 million), lapping a prior year revenue deduction adjustment ($13 million) and favorable foreign currency translation ($10 million). These increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue from the sale of our Tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($56 million) and licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 ($50 million).Operating MarginChannel Development operating income for fiscal 2018 decreased 4% to $927.1 million, compared to $967.0 million in fiscal 2017. Operating margin decreased 250 basis points to 40.4%, primarily driven by business taxes associated with the up-front payment received from Nestlé (approximately 120 basis points), Global Coffee Alliance headcount-related costs, including employee bonus and retention costs (approximately 80 basis points), and the impact of our ownership changes, including licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé and the sale of our Tazo brand.35Table of ContentsCorporate and OtherFiscal Year EndedSep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 %ChangeNet revenues: Company-operated stores$66.7 $182.4 (63.4)%Licensed stores1.2 2.7 (55.6)Other54.5 111.4 (51.1)Total net revenues122.4 296.5 (58.7)Cost of sales84.9 161.3 (47.4)Store operating expenses41.3 148.5 (72.2)Other operating expenses18.3 36.8 (50.3)Depreciation and amortization expenses157.1 159.1 (1.3)General and administrative expenses1,086.7 904.4 20.2Restructuring and impairments135.9 131.5 3.3Total operating expenses1,524.2 1,541.6 (1.1)Operating loss$(1,401.8) $(1,245.1) 12.6 %Corporate and Other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses, as well as Evolution Fresh and the legacy operations of the Teavana retail business, which substantially ceased during fiscal 2018. Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash and Investment OverviewOur cash and investments were $3.0 billion and $9.2 billion as of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, respectively, with the decrease driven by the usage of the up-front prepaid royalty associated with the Global Coffee Alliance primarily for share repurchases. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and corporate debt securities. As of September 29, 2019, approximately $1.7 billion of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing capacityOur $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the “2018 credit facility”) and our $1.0 billion unsecured 364-Day credit facility (the “364-day credit facility”) are available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases.The 2018 credit facility, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on October 25, 2022. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility) in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the five-year credit agreement. The current applicable margin is 0.910% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.000% (nil) for Base Rate Loans. The 364-day credit facility, of which no amount may be used for issuances of letters of credit, was set to mature on October 23, 2019. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the maturity has been extended to October 21, 2020. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is 0.920% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.000% (nil) for Base Rate Loans.Both credit facilities contain provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 29, 2019, we were in 36Table of Contentscompliance with all applicable credit facility covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of September 29, 2019.Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facilities discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of September 29, 2019, we had no borrowings under our commercial paper program. In May 2019, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $1.0 billion of 10-year 3.550% Senior Notes (the “2029 notes”) due August 2029 and $1.0 billion of 30-year 4.450% Senior Notes (the “2049 notes”) due August 2049. Interest on the 2029 notes and the 2049 notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing on August 15, 2019.In August 2018, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $1.25 billion of 7-year 3.800% Senior Notes (the “2025 notes”) due August 2025, $750 million of 10-year 4.000% Senior Notes (the “2028 notes”) due November 2028 and $1 billion of 30-year 4.500% Senior Notes (the “2048 notes”) due November 2048. Interest on the 2025 notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing on February 15, 2019. Interest on the 2028 and 2048 notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15, commencing on November 15, 2018.In February 2018, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $1.0 billion of 5-year 3.100% Senior Notes (the “2023 notes”) due March 2023 and $600 million of 10-year 3.500% Senior Notes (the “2028 notes”) due March 2028. Interest on the 2023 and 2028 notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1, commencing on September 1, 2018.In November 2017, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 3-year 2.200% Senior Notes (the “2020 notes”) due November 2020 and $500 million of 30-year 3.750% Senior Notes (the “2047 notes”) due December 2047. Interest on the 2020 notes is payable semi-annually on May 22 and November 22, commencing on May 22, 2018 and interest on the 2047 notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1, commencing on June 1, 2018.We will use the net proceeds from the offering of the 2049 notes to enhance our sustainability programs. We will use the net proceeds from these remaining offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repurchases of our common stock under our ongoing share repurchase program, business expansion and payment of dividends.See Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.The indentures under which all of our Senior Notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 29, 2019, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of CashWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt, to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures, new product innovations, related marketing support and partner and digital investments, return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core and other developing businesses. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as any shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.We regularly review our cash positions and our determination of indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional 37Table of Contentsforeign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. We have revised our indefinite reinvestment assertions for prior years' cumulative earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. This change did not have a material impact to our financial results. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need for, repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. See Note 13, Income Taxes, for further discussion.During each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2018, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.30 per share. In the last two quarters of fiscal 2018 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, we declared a cash dividend of $0.36 per share. Dividends are paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2019 and 2018 totaled $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion, respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we declared a cash dividend of $0.41 per share to be paid on November 29, 2019 with an expected payout of approximately $486 million.We entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASR agreements”) with third-party financial institutions totaling $5.0 billion, effective October 1, 2018. We made a $5.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 72.0 million shares of our common stock. In March 2019, we received an additional 4.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $65.03.Additionally, we entered into ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions totaling $2.0 billion, effective March 22, 2019. We made a $2.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 22.2 million shares of our common stock. In June 2019, we received an additional 3.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $76.50.Outside of the ASR agreements noted above, during fiscal 2019 and 2018, we repurchased 36.6 million and 131.5 million shares of common stock, respectively, or $3.1 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively, on the open market. For fiscal 2019, in connection with the ASR agreements and other open market transactions, we repurchased 139.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $10.1 billion. In the first quarter 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase of 120 million shares to our ongoing share repurchase program. As of September 29, 2019, 29.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations.Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2020 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores and our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 are expected to be approximately $1.8 billion.Cash FlowsCash provided by operating activities was $5.0 billion for fiscal 2019, compared to $11.9 billion for fiscal 2018. The change was primarily driven by lapping the prior year receipt of the up-front payment from Nestlé in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.Cash used by investing activities totaled $1.0 billion for fiscal 2019, compared to $2.4 billion for fiscal 2018. The change was primarily driven by lapping the prior year payment to acquire the 50% ownership interest in our East China joint venture and higher proceeds from the divestiture of certain operations.Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2019 totaled $10.1 billion, compared to $3.2 billion for fiscal 2018. The change was primarily due to lower proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and higher repurchases of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase agreements in fiscal 2019.38Table of ContentsContractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 29, 2019, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations (1)Total Less than 1Year 1 - 3Years 3 - 5Years More than5 YearsOperating lease obligations (2)$10,230.9 $1,432.9 $2,589.6 $2,120.7 $4,087.7Financing lease obligations67.9 5.2 10.2 9.9 42.6Debt obligations Principal payments11,238.3 — 1,750.0 2,538.3 6,950.0Interest payments5,109.7 372.6 705.1 602.3 3,429.7Purchase obligations (3)1,135.4 665.3 411.1 59.0 —Other obligations (4)454.6 109.4 63.2 85.3 196.7Total$28,236.8 $2,585.4 $5,529.2 $5,415.5 $14,706.7(1) We have excluded long-term gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties of $140.1 million from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain.

Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 93% of total purchase obligations.(4) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of the Tax Act transition tax, asset retirement obligations, Valor Siren Ventures I L.P. (VSV) investment and hedging instruments.Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONSCommodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. Excluding interest rate swaps, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.39Table of ContentsCommodity Price RiskWe purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 29, 2019 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices.

However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 29, 2019 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates.

Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of September 29, 2019 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.40Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskLong-term DebtWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of September 29, 2019.The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of September 29, 2019 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): Change in Fair Value Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying Rate Long-term debt (1) $12,033 $846 $(846)(1) Amount disclosed is net of ($26 million) change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap. Refer to Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge.Available-for-Sale Debt SecuritiesOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 29, 2019 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESCritical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived AssetsWe evaluate property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an 41Table of Contentsappropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. During fiscal 2019, there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion.The goodwill impairment charges are discussed in Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates 42Table of Contentswe use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We have revised our indefinite reinvestment assertions for prior years’ cumulative earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material.Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.Refer to Note 13, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for additional discussion surrounding the changes as a result of the Tax Act.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Commodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Report.43Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:46:06.892164
829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2020,"Item 7.Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsGeneralOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted.OverviewStarbucks results for fiscal 2020 reflect the challenges our business faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted our results, particularly during the second and third fiscal quarters. Consolidated revenues declined 11% to $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $26.5 billion in fiscal 2019 driven by temporary closures of a significant number of our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as modified business operations and reduced customer traffic. We gradually reopened our stores and, since then, have seen sequential improvements in comparable store sales in both our Americas and International segments as transaction volumes continue to climb, reflecting the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brand.Comparable store sales for the Americas segment declined by 12% for fiscal 2020, primarily due to the temporary store closures, reduced customer traffic and shortened store hours. The most negative impacts occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Most company-operated and licensed stores were re-opened as of early May, and over 60% of company-operated stores in the U.S. provided limited seating by the end of the fiscal year. To help protect the health and welfare of our partners, we incurred incremental labor costs, including paying the wages and benefits to partners who were either unable or uncomfortable working from mid-March through May, a temporary wage increase for partners who continued working during this period and additional benefits to furloughed or separated partners resulting from reduced store hours. The incremental wages incurred were partially offset by qualified tax credits provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (“CEWS”). In June 2020, we announced a plan to optimize our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense, metropolitan markets, by blending store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we closed approximately 100 stores in the U.S. and Canada, and we expect to close an additional 700 stores in those markets over the next 18 months. This reflects an additional 200 store closures than the initial announcement estimate of 600 stores. Costs incurred related to the restructuring efforts are recorded as restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statement of earnings and will continue to be recorded in accordance with the anticipated timeline of store closures.For the International segment, comparable store sales declined by 19% for fiscal 2020, mostly due to the 31% and 37% reduction in comparable store sales during the second and third fiscal quarters of 2020, respectively. Company-operated stores in the China market began re-opening in the fiscal second quarter, and nearly all company-operated stores were open by the end of the fiscal third quarter. To support our international licensees in their recovery efforts, we extended more flexible development and financial terms, including waiving royalty payments during the fiscal third quarter. Revenue for our Channel Development segment declined $68 million, or 3%, when compared with fiscal 2019. This is largely due to the lapping of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including higher inventory sales in the prior year as Nestlé prepared to fulfill customer orders. These are partially offset by the continued growth of the Global Coffee Alliance during fiscal 2020.Throughout the second half of fiscal 2020, we experienced initial business recovery as our stores gradually reopened under modified operations to meet public health guidelines and evolving customer behaviors and expectations. As of September 27, 2020, nearly all of our company-operated and licensed stores were re-opened. Those that have remained closed are located in travel or transportation hubs as well as central business districts. Our global business is recovering steadily, with China approaching comparable store sales recovery and the U.S. demonstrating continued upward momentum in sales and profitability. Our Channel Development segment continues to grow category share as customers adjust to their at-home routines. In fiscal 2021, we expect lower revenues for the segment as we transitioned our single-serve coffee business to a more royalty-based model. We do not expect the change to have a material impact on our earnings. However, the change is anticipated to have an accretive impact on operating margin for the segment. We continue to invest in technologies and innovations to elevate the customer and partner experience and to drive long-term growth. By reimagining our store formats, we are moving swiftly to adapt to new customer behaviors. Absent significant COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our retail business recovery and our focused efforts to expand contactless customer experiences, digital capabilities and beverage innovation, we believe we are well positioned to regain the positive business momentum we had demonstrated prior to the pandemic. Financial Highlights•Total net revenues decreased 11% to $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $26.5 billion in fiscal 2019.25Table of Contents•Consolidated operating income decreased to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to operating income of $4.1 billion in fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2020 operating margin was 6.6% compared to 15.4% in fiscal 2019. Operating margin contraction was primarily driven by sales deleverage and additional costs incurred attributable to COVID-19, including catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs for retail store partners, net of benefits provided by government subsidies. Higher restructuring activities related to our Americas store portfolio optimization and investments to support key business partners also contributed. These decreases were partially offset by sales leverage realized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 prior to the onset of COVID-19 impacts and supply chain efficiencies.•Earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2020 decreased to $0.79, compared to EPS of $2.92 in fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the adverse impacts of COVID-19, including lower revenues due to temporary store closures, reduced customer traffic and modified operations, as well as incremental labor expenses and restructuring costs.•Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to a pause in new store openings due to COVID-19.•We returned $3.6 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2020 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $12.0 billion in fiscal 2019. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in March 2020.Acquisitions and DivestituresSee Note 2, Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):RevenuesFiscal Year EndedSep 27,2020Sep 29,2019%ChangeNet revenues:Company-operated stores$19,164.6 $21,544.4 (11.0)%Licensed stores2,327.1 2,875.0 (19.1)Other 2,026.3 2,089.2 (3.0)Total net revenues$23,518.0 $26,508.6 (11.3)%Total net revenues decreased $3.0 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower revenues from company-operated stores ($2.4 billion). The decline in company-operated store revenue was due to a 14% decrease in comparable store sales ($2.9 billion), attributable to a 22% decrease in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 10% increase in average ticket. Also contributing to the decrease were the conversions of our retail businesses in Thailand, France and the Netherlands to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($204 million). Partially offsetting these decreases were the incremental revenues from 806 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings, or a 5% increase, over the past 12 months ($718 million).Licensed stores revenue declined by $548 million, driven by lower product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees.Other revenues decreased $63 million, primarily due to the lapping of a higher volume of transition activities related to the Global Coffee Alliance and the Tazo brand sale, partially offset by higher sales from the growth of the Global Coffee Alliance. 26Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 27,2020Sep 29,2019Sep 27,2020Sep 29,2019As a % of TotalNet RevenuesProduct and distribution costs$7,694.9 $8,526.9 32.7 %32.2 %Store operating expenses 10,764.0 10,493.6 45.8 39.6 Other operating expenses430.3 371.0 1.8 1.4 Depreciation and amortization expenses1,431.3 1,377.3 6.1 5.2 General and administrative expenses1,679.6 1,824.1 7.1 6.9 Restructuring and impairments278.7 135.8 1.2 0.5 Total operating expenses22,278.8 22,728.7 94.7 85.7 Income from equity investees322.5 298.0 1.4 1.1 Operating income$1,561.7 $4,077.9 6.6 %15.4 %Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues56.2 %48.7 %Product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage attributable to COVID-19 impacts, which included inventory write-offs and product waste (approximately 10 basis points), partially offset by supply chain efficiencies (approximately 60 basis points).Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 620 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 750 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage attributable to COVID-19 impacts, which included catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs for retail partners, net of benefits provided by temporary subsidies from the U.S. and certain foreign governments (approximately 150 basis points).Other operating expenses increased $59 million, primarily due to incremental costs to develop and grow the Global Coffee Alliance.Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 90 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage.General and administrative expenses decreased $145 million, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation ($63 million), lapping of the 2018 U.S stock award granted in fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (“Tax Act”) and vested in fiscal 2019 ($61 million), and lapping of the 2019 Starbucks Leadership Experience in Chicago ($52 million), partially offset by incremental strategic investments in technology. Restructuring and impairment expenses increased $143 million, primarily due to higher asset impairment related to our North America store portfolio optimization ($136 million), higher lease-related costs associated with the closure of certain company-operated stores ($28 million) and intangible asset impairment related to changes in our branding and marketing strategies ($22 million). Partially offsetting theses increases were lower severance costs ($38 million) and lapping the impairment related to our Switzerland retail market ($10 million).Income from equity investees increased $25 million, primarily due to higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture and growth in our South Korea joint venture.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 880 basis points in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019.27Table of ContentsOther Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 27,2020Sep 29,2019Sep 27,2020Sep 29,2019 As a % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income$1,561.7 $4,077.9 6.6 %15.4 %Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations — 622.8 — 2.3 Interest income and other, net39.7 96.5 0.2 0.4 Interest expense(437.0)(331.0)(1.9)(1.2)Earnings before income taxes1,164.4 4,466.2 5.0 16.8 Income tax expense239.7 871.6 1.0 3.3 Net earnings including noncontrolling interests924.7 3,594.6 3.9 13.6 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests(3.6)(4.6)— — Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$928.3 $3,599.2 3.9 %13.6 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests20.6 %19.5 %Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations decreased $623 million due to lapping the sale of retail operations in Thailand, France and the Netherlands in fiscal 2019. Interest income and other, net decreased $57 million, primarily due to lower interest rates and lapping the gain on the sale of a non-operating asset.Interest expense increased $106 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in March 2020 and May 2020.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 20.6% compared to 19.5% for fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to the valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets of certain international jurisdictions (approximately 980 basis points). This unfavorable impact was partially offset by lower pre-tax earnings including the foreign rate differential on our jurisdictional mix of earnings (approximately 340 basis points), stock-based compensation excess tax benefits in relation to pre-tax earnings (approximately 250 basis points), remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to enacted corporate rate change (approximately 220 basis points) and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (approximately 170 basis points).

Also contributing were lower product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($354 million). These decreases were partially offset by 134 net new Starbucks® company-operated stores, or a 1% increase, over the past 12 months ($436 million). Operating MarginAmericas operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 52% to $1.8 billion, compared to $3.8 billion in fiscal 2019. Operating margin decreased 960 basis points to 11.1%, primarily due to sales deleverage attributed to reduced labor productivity and additional costs incurred as a result of COVID-19, mainly catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs for retail store partners incurred primarily during the fiscal third quarter, net of benefits provided by the CARES Act and CEWS (approximately 180 basis points). Higher restructuring expenses relating to our North America portfolio optimization (approximately 130 basis points) also contributed to the decrease. Partially offsetting these decreases were sales leverage realized prior to the onset of COVID-19 and pricing increases.29Table of ContentsInternationalFiscal Year EndedSep 27,2020Sep 29,2019Sep 27,2020Sep 29,2019As a % of International Total Net RevenuesNet revenues:Company-operated stores$4,385.8 $5,256.2 85.2 %84.9 %Licensed stores734.2 917.0 14.3 14.8 Other27.6 17.5 0.5 0.3 Total net revenues5,147.6 6,190.7 100.0 100.0 Product and distribution costs1,682.0 1,894.9 32.7 30.6 Store operating expenses2,276.0 2,428.5 44.2 39.2 Other operating expenses141.3 116.4 2.7 1.9 Depreciation and amortization expenses518.4 511.5 10.1 8.3 General and administrative expenses279.4 317.9 5.4 5.1 Restructuring and impairments(1.2)59.2 — 1.0 Total operating expenses4,895.9 5,328.4 95.1 86.1 Income from equity investees102.3 102.4 2.0 1.7 Operating income$354.0 $964.7 6.9 %15.6 %RevenuesInternational total net revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased $1.0 billion, or 17%, primarily due to a 19% decrease in comparable store sales ($931 million) driven by a 23% decrease in transactions, partially offset by a 5% increase in average ticket. Also contributing were lower product sales and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($199 million) and the conversions of our retail businesses in Thailand, France and the Netherlands to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($186 million). These decreases were partially offset by 672 net new Starbucks® company-operated stores, or an 11% increase, over the past 12 months ($282 million). Operating MarginInternational operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 63% to $354 million, compared to $965 million in fiscal 2019. Operating margin decreased 870 basis points to 6.9%, primarily driven by sales deleverage concentrated in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020 attributable to COVID-19, including continued partner wages and benefits as well as occupancy costs. Royalty relief granted to licensees during the third fiscal quarter also contributed to the decline (approximately 80 basis points).30Table of ContentsChannel DevelopmentFiscal Year EndedSep 27,2020Sep 29,2019Sep 27,2020Sep 29,2019As a % of Channel Development Total Net RevenuesNet revenues$1,925.0 $1,992.6 Product and distribution costs1,338.1 1,390.0 69.5 69.8 Other operating expenses108.2 76.2 5.6 3.8 Depreciation and amortization expenses1.2 13.0 0.1 0.7 General and administrative expenses10.5 11.5 0.5 0.6 Total operating expenses1,458.0 1,490.7 75.7 74.8 Income from equity investees220.2 195.6 11.4 9.8 Operating income$687.2 $697.5 35.7 %35.0 %RevenuesChannel Development total net revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased $68 million, or 3% compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to the lapping of higher transition activities related to the Global Coffee Alliance ($115 million) and product sales to Unilever as a result of the sale and transition of the Tazo brand ($34 million). These were partially offset by the expansion of the Global Coffee Alliance ($70 million), as at-home coffee consumption grew while the Foodservice business experienced softening due to COVID-19. Operating MarginChannel Development operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 1% to $687 million, compared to $698 million in fiscal 2019. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 35.7%, primarily due to the transfer of certain single-serve products to Nestlé as part of the Global Coffee Alliance (approximately 150 basis points), strong performance from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture (approximately 80 basis points) and lapping the correction of amortization expense (approximately 60 basis points) in the prior year, partially offset by certain transition items related to the Global Coffee Alliance (approximately 190 basis points).31Table of ContentsCorporate and OtherFiscal Year EndedSep 27,2020Sep 29,2019% ChangeNet revenues:Other $66.2 $66.3 (0.2)%Total net revenues66.2 66.3 (0.2)Product and distribution costs63.3 67.3 (5.9)Store operating expenses— 0.3 nmOther operating expenses14.0 18.6 (24.7)Depreciation and amortization expenses149.7 156.7 (4.5)General and administrative expenses1,121.7 1,170.8 (4.2)Restructuring and impairments22.3 19.7 13.2 Total operating expenses1,371.0 1,433.4 (4.4)Operating loss$(1,304.8)$(1,367.1)(4.6)%Corporate and Other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses and Evolution Fresh.

This decrease was primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation and lapping of the 2018 U.S stock award granted in fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the Tax Act and vested in fiscal 2019, partially offset by incremental strategic investments in technology. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):RevenuesFiscal Year EndedSep 29,2019Sep 30,2018%ChangeNet revenues:Company-operated stores$21,544.4 $19,690.3 9.4 %Licensed stores2,875.0 2,652.2 8.4 Other2,089.2 2,377.0 (12.1)Total net revenues$26,508.6 $24,719.5 7.2 %Total net revenues increased $1.8 billion, or 7%, over fiscal 2018, primarily driven by higher revenues from company-operated stores ($1.9 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 947 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($957 million) and a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($879 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($189 million) and the conversion of our Thailand, France and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($161 million).Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($223 million), primarily due to higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($228 million), largely due to the opening of 992 net new Starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months, and the conversion of our Thailand, France and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($35 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($41 million).Other revenues decreased $288 million, primarily driven by the licensing of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé. Partially offsetting this decrease was growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with the Global Coffee Alliance.32Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 29,2019Sep 30,2018Sep 29,2019Sep 30,2018As a % of TotalNet RevenuesProduct and distribution costs$8,526.9 $7,930.7 32.2 %32.1 %Store operating expenses10,493.6 9,472.2 39.6 38.3 Other operating expenses371.0 554.9 1.4 2.2 Depreciation and amortization expenses1,377.3 1,247.0 5.2 5.0 General and administrative expenses1,824.1 1,708.2 6.9 6.9 Restructuring and impairments135.8 224.4 0.5 0.9 Total operating expenses22,728.7 21,137.4 85.7 85.5 Income from equity investees298.0 301.2 1.1 1.2 Operating income$4,077.9 $3,883.3 15.4 %15.7 %Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues48.7 %48.1 %Product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 10 basis points, primarily due to licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé (approximately 80 basis points), partially offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 70 basis points) and leverage on product and distribution costs, largely driven by price increases.Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 130 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily driven by investments in our store partners that are funded by savings from the Tax Act and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the Americas segment, partially offset by sales leverage driven by price increases and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage.Other operating expenses decreased $184 million, primarily due to cost savings related to licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé ($176 million) and lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance ($34 million), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestlé and headcount-related costs, primarily relating to employee bonus and retention costs.Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 20 basis points).General and administrative expenses increased $116 million, primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation ($89 million) and the 2019 Starbucks Leadership Experience in Chicago, heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter ($52 million).Restructuring and impairment expenses decreased $89 million, primarily due to lower restructuring and impairment costs related to TeavanaTM/MC retail store closures ($128 million) and lower impairments related to our Switzerland retail market ($27 million), partially offset by higher exit costs associated with the closure of certain Starbucks® company-operated stores ($32 million) and severance costs ($25 million).Income from equity investees decreased $3 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership changes in East China. This decrease was partially offset by improved comparable store sales from our joint venture in South Korea and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 30 basis points in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018.33Table of ContentsOther Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedSep 29,2019Sep 30,2018Sep 29,2019Sep 30,2018 As a % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income$4,077.9 $3,883.3 15.4 %15.7 %Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture— 1,376.4 — 5.6 Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations622.8 499.2 2.3 2.0 Interest income and other, net96.5 191.4 0.4 0.8 Interest expense(331.0)(170.3)(1.2)(0.7)Earnings before income taxes4,466.2 5,780.0 16.8 23.4 Income tax expense871.6 1,262.0 3.3 5.1 Net earnings including noncontrolling interests3,594.6 4,518.0 13.6 18.3 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests(4.6)(0.3)— — Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$3,599.2 $4,518.3 13.6 %18.3 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests19.5 %21.8 %Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture in fiscal 2018 was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50% ownership interest in our East China joint venture to fair value upon acquisition.Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations was primarily due to the sale of our Thailand, France and the Netherlands retail operations in fiscal 2019. The gain in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the sale of our Tazo brand and Taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our Brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018.Interest income and other, net decreased $95 million, primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on a prospective basis, which required estimated breakage on unredeemed store value cards to be recorded as revenue. We recorded stored value card breakage in interest income and other, net in the prior year.Interest expense increased $161 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in November 2017, March 2018, August 2018 and May 2019.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 19.5% compared to 21.8% for fiscal 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Act (approximately 350 basis points), lapping prior year's transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities (approximately 300 basis points), higher stock-based compensation excess tax benefit (approximately 140 basis points), the release of income tax reserves related to the settlement of a U.S. tax examination and the expiration of statute of limitations (approximately 130 basis points) and the tax impacts of the gain on the sale of our Thailand retail operations (approximately 130 basis points). These favorable impacts were partially offset by the lapping of prior year's gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture that was not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (approximately 170 basis points).

Partially offsetting these were cost savings initiatives, primarily in product and distribution costs (approximately 90 basis points), the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage (approximately 50 basis points) and sales leverage.35Table of ContentsInternationalFiscal Year EndedSep 29,2019Sep 30,2018Sep 29,2019Sep 30,2018 As a % of InternationalTotal Net RevenuesNet revenues:Company-operated stores$5,256.2 $4,702.1 84.9 %84.7 %Licensed stores917.0 837.0 14.8 15.1 Other17.5 12.1 0.3 0.2 Total net revenues6,190.7 5,551.2 100.0 100.0 Product and distribution costs1,894.9 1,709.4 30.6 30.8 Store operating expenses2,428.5 2,182.3 39.2 39.3 Other operating expenses116.4 98.9 1.9 1.8 Depreciation and amortization expenses511.5 447.6 8.3 8.1 General and administrative expenses317.9 302.5 5.1 5.4 Restructuring and impairments59.2 55.1 1.0 1.0 Total operating expenses5,328.4 4,795.8 86.1 86.4 Income from equity investees102.4 117.4 1.7 2.1 Operating income$964.7 $872.8 15.6 %15.7 %Discussion of our International segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating our East China business from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of December 31, 2017. Under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product and distribution costs as well as our proportionate share of East China's net earnings, which resulted in a higher margin business. Under the company-operated ownership model, East China’s operating results are reflected in most income statement lines of this segment.RevenuesInternational total net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased $640 million, or 12%%, primarily driven by 665 net new Starbucks® company-operated stores, or a 12% increase, over the past 12 months ($377 million), the ownership change in East China ($280 million) and a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($135 million).

In fiscal 2020, cash and investments increased by $1.8 billion primarily due to the issuance of short-term and long-term debt as well as lower share repurchases following the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program in March 2020. These liquidity increases offset lower retail cash inflows due to temporary store closures and modified operations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper. As of September 27, 2020, approximately $2.0 billion of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing capacityCredit Facilities and Commercial PaperOur total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $2.7 billion as of the end of fiscal 2020 when combining the unused commercial paper program and credit facilities discussed below, less outstanding borrowing.Revolving Lines of CreditOur $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (“the 2018 credit facility”), of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on October 25, 2022.

Interest on the 2027 notes, the 2030 notes and the 2050 notes is payable semi-annually on March 12 and September 12, commencing on September 12, 2020.See Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.Our ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the Senior Notes were issued. As of September 27, 2020, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of CashWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including 39Table of Contentsinvesting in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our “Growth at Scale” agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.We believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases. To further strengthen our liquidity in the near term, we currently expect the suspension of share repurchases to continue through the end of fiscal 2021. If necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances.We regularly review our cash positions and our determination of indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. We do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. See Note 14, Income Taxes, for further discussion.During fiscal 2020, we entered into a new $500 million unsecured 364-day term-loan facility (“the 2020 term-loan facility”) which we drew on and subsequently repaid within the fiscal year. The 2020 term-loan facility was originally set to mature on March 19, 2021.During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.36 per share. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $0.41 per share. Dividends are paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2020 and 2019 totaled $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $0.45 per share to be paid on November 27, 2020 with an expected payout of approximately $527.9 million. As of the date of this report, we do not expect to reduce our quarterly dividend as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.In September 2018, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASR agreements”) with third-party financial institutions totaling $5.0 billion, effective October 1, 2018. We made a $5.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 72.0 million shares of our common stock. In March 2019, we received an additional 4.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $65.03.Additionally, in March 2019, we entered into ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions totaling $2.0 billion, effective March 22, 2019. We made a $2.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 22.2 million shares of our common stock. In June 2019, we received an additional 3.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $76.50. Outside of the ASR agreements noted above, we repurchased 36.6 million shares of common stock for $3.1 billion on the open market during the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019. In total, we repurchased 139.6 million shares at a total cost of $10.1 billion for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019.Our Board of Directors approved an increase of 120 million and 40 million shares to our ongoing share repurchase program during the fiscal first quarter of 2019 and fiscal second quarter of 2020, respectively. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in March 2020. Prior to the suspension, we repurchased 20.3 million shares of common stock for $1.7 billion on the open market during the year ended September 27, 2020. As of September 27, 2020, 48.9 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. The existing share repurchase program remains authorized by the Board of Directors. The suspension of the share repurchases is currently expected to continue through fiscal 2021, and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time, depending upon operating results, our capital needs and other factors.Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2021 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores and our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are expected to be approximately $1.9 billion.40Table of ContentsCash FlowsCash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $5.0 billion for fiscal 2019. The change was primarily due to temporary retail store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. federal tax payment related to the Nestlé transaction and the timing of other tax payments and refunds.Cash used in investing activities totaled $1.7 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $1.0 billion for fiscal 2019. The change was primarily driven by lapping proceeds from the divestiture of certain operations related to the conversions of our retail businesses in Thailand, France and the Netherlands to fully licensed markets during 2019 and an increase in purchase of investments in fiscal 2020. This was partially offset by lower capital expenditures for new and existing stores.Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 totaled $1.7 billion, compared to cash used in financing activities of $10.1 billion for fiscal 2019. The change was primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase agreements in fiscal 2019 and higher proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2020.Contractual ObligationsThe following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 27, 2020, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by PeriodContractual Obligations(1)TotalLess than 1Year1 - 3Years3 - 5YearsMore than5 YearsOperating lease obligations(2)$10,089.6 $1,528.1 $2,668.7 $2,112.6 $3,780.2 Debt obligationsPrincipal payments16,445.2 1,688.8 2,000.0 2,806.4 9,950.0 Interest payments7,140.5 501.2 893.4 793.5 4,952.4 Purchase obligations(3)1,237.1 750.3 423.4 63.4 — Other obligations(4)498.9 101.0 71.5 115.9 210.5 Total$35,411.3 $4,569.4 $6,057.0 $5,891.8 $18,893.1 (1)We have excluded long-term gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties of $137.5 million from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain.

Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 93% of total purchase obligations.(4)Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of the Tax Act transition tax, asset retirement obligations, Valor Siren Ventures I L.P. (VSV) investment and hedging instruments.Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business.Off-Balance Sheet ArrangementsOff-balance sheet arrangements relate to purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONSCommodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate 41Table of Contentsrisk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances and cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and foreign exchange exposure of net investments in Japan. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.Commodity Price RiskWe purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 27, 2020 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): Increase/(Decrease) to Net EarningsIncrease/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate10% Increase inUnderlying Rate10% Decrease inUnderlying RateCommodity hedges$1 $(1)$13 $(13)Foreign Currency Exchange RiskThe majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. The volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 27, 2020 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates.

Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of September 27, 2020 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.42Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskLong-term DebtWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of September 27, 2020.The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of September 27, 2020 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): Change in Fair ValueFair Value100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying RateLong-term debt(1)$17,500 $1,294 $(1,294)(1)Amount disclosed is net of $23 million change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap. Refer to Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge.Available-for-Sale Debt SecuritiesOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 27, 2020 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESCritical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, especially in light of the current economic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity.We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise.43Table of ContentsProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived AssetsWe evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses.Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. In each of the three fiscal years prior to fiscal 2020, our business has operated at levels of growth and profitability that have not required material numbers of our store assets to be reviewed for potential impairment. Given the substantial reduction in our revenues and cash flows as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, along with our announced restructuring plans to close up to 800 of our company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada in the next 18 months, we identified triggering events that required us to assess the need for potential impairment charges for a larger number of company-operated stores in fiscal 2020 than in prior years. As a result of these activities, we recorded store impairment charges of $298.9 million in fiscal 2020, of which $239.3 million was included in restructuring and impairment expenses on our consolidated statement of earnings. The magnitude of these charges was not particularly sensitive to variations in fair value inputs, as the majority of charges recorded were the result of full impairments of stores identified for closure, based on factors such as the format and location of the store or its current operating performance. Excluding stores in areas impacted by our restructuring plans, our company-operated store portfolio is projecting a return to pre-COVID-19 levels of operations and cash flow recoverability within the next 12 months. However, irrespective of the above, our expectations of business recovery trends may vary materially in future periods based on the pace of global and market-specific recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.As of September 27, 2020, we had identified 405 stores in the U.S. and Canada for closure under our restructuring plans. We expect to potentially identify up to another 395 stores for closure. We expect total future restructuring costs, which are attributable to our Americas segment, to range from approximately $260 million to $400 million. These restructuring costs include accelerated amortization or impairments of ROU assets due to planned store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms ($150 million to $190 million), store asset impairment and disposal costs not previously recorded as part of our ongoing store impairment process ($100 million to $190 million) and the remaining amount relates to employee termination costs. Our estimates of future restructuring costs are based on actual costs incurred for recently closed stores of similar profile under the restructuring plans. As we have previously recorded impairment charges in fiscal 2020 for stores that may be identified for closure under our plans, and because store closure decisions are still subject to change, the final costs associated with these store closures may be different from the initial estimates. These costs will depend on the asset carrying value and remaining lease term for each store identified. Future restructuring costs are expected to be incurred over the next 18 months as stores are specifically identified for closure or, in the case of lease exit costs, when the stores cease operations.Asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair 44Table of Contentsvalue of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post COVID-19, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. Our goodwill impairment assessments were not significantly altered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the U.S. and China, we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months.When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post COVID-19, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. During fiscal 2020, we recorded a charge of $22.1 million relating to the impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset due to changes in branding and marketing strategy. The amount of charge taken was not materially impacted by our choice of fair value assumptions, and we do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months.Definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). During fiscal 2020, we recorded valuation allowances of $56.5 million to reduce our deferred tax asset balance as of the beginning of the fiscal year relating to certain foreign jurisdictions not expected to generate enough future income to offset accumulated losses. Absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the U.S., China and Japan, we do not anticipate incurring significant additional valuation allowances against our remaining deferred tax assets as of September 27, 2020 in the next 12 months.In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is 45Table of Contentsmore likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. These plans have been unaltered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material.Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted COVID-19 business recovery, could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Commodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Report.46Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:45:45.751020
829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2021,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2020. The fiscal 2021 Latin America and Caribbean licensed store market resegmentation did not have a material impact to prior year North America and International operating segment business trends and operating margins.OverviewIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, certain changes were made to our management team, and our operating segment reporting structure was realigned as a result. We realigned our fully licensed Latin America and Caribbean markets from our Americas operating segment to our International operating segment. Additionally, we renamed the Americas operating segment to the North America operating segment, since it is comprised of our company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada. We also made certain other immaterial changes between our International operating segment and Corporate and Other. Concurrent with the change in reportable segments, we revised our prior period financial information to be consistent with the current period presentation. There was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income or net earnings per share as a result of these changes.We have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments such as Evolution Fresh and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.Our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales and margin management. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:•New store openings and store count•Comparable store sales•Operating marginStarbucks results for fiscal 2021 demonstrate the overall strength and resilience of our brand. Consolidated revenues increased 24% to $29.1 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020, primarily due to business recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Also contributing to the increase was $576 million of incremental revenue attributable to the extra week in fiscal 2021.For the North America segment, comparable store sales increased 22% for fiscal 2021 compared to a decline of 12% in fiscal 2020. Comparable store sales for our U.S. market increased 21% for fiscal 2021 compared to a decline of 12% in fiscal 2020. The U.S. market also had a 7% increase in two-year comparable store sales(1). We lapped higher costs attributable to COVID-19 in the prior year, including catastrophe pay programs for company-operated store partners (employees), net of qualified tax credits provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (“CEWS”). In fiscal 2020, we announced a restructuring plan to optimize our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense, metropolitan markets, by blending store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. As of the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021, we had substantially completed our restructuring plan, which resulted in the closure of 807 stores in the U.S. and Canada. Costs incurred related to the restructuring efforts were recorded as restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. In October 2021, we announced plans to deliver retail wage increases across the U.S. in fiscal 2022. This investment, combined with industry-leading benefits, supports Starbucks aspiration to remain an employer of choice that can attract and retain the high-quality talent necessary to support our continued growth.For the International segment, comparable store sales increased by 16% for fiscal 2021 compared to a decline of 19% in fiscal 2020. Comparable store sales for our China market increased 17%, inclusive of a 3% adverse impact from lapping the prior-year value-added tax (“VAT”) benefit. Key markets in the International segment continued to experience pandemic-related restrictions that significantly impacted customer mobility during the year. Although nearly all company-operated stores in these markets remained open, the modified operating protocols had an adverse impact to comparable store sales and operating results.26Table of ContentsRevenue for our Channel Development segment decreased $331 million, or 17%, when compared with fiscal 2020. This was largely due to the transition of certain single-serve product activities to Nestlé beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. This was partially offset by growth in our ready-to-drink business. We expect Channel Development to return to more normalized reported revenue growth levels in fiscal 2022, as the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 is the last quarter lapping these transition related activities.During fiscal 2021, we began to experience certain supply shortages and transportation delays largely attributable to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as changes in customer demand and behaviors. While we expect these shortages and delays may continue into fiscal 2022, we view them to be temporary and do not believe they will have a material impact to our long-term growth and profitability. Absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts to elevate customer experiences, enhance digital capabilities and drive beverage innovation, we are confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of long-term “Growth at Scale” strategy to deliver consistent revenue and income growth. We anticipate the planned wage investment in the U.S., along with increased supply chain costs primarily related to inflationary pressures that began in the latter half of the fiscal year, will have an impact to operating margin in fiscal 2022. However, these should be meaningfully offset by benefits from pricing decisions and leverage from revenue growth and productivity efficiency.(1)Two-year comparable store sales metric is calculated as ((1 + % change in comparable store sales in FY20) * (1 + % change in comparable store sales in FY21)) - 1. Two-year comparable store sales for the U.S. of 7% = ((1 + (-12%)) * (1 + 21%)) - 1. Financial Highlights•Total net revenues increased 24% to $29.1 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020, including $576 million attributable to the extra week in fiscal 2021.•Consolidated operating income increased to $4.9 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2021 operating margin was 16.8% compared to 6.6% in fiscal 2020. Operating margin expansion was primarily due to sales leverage from business recovery and lapping higher COVID-19 related costs in the prior year, mainly catastrophe and service pay for store partners, net of temporary subsidies from the U.S. and certain foreign governments, as well as pricing in North America in the current year. These increases were partially offset by enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits and, to a lesser extent, increased supply chain costs due to accelerated inflationary pressures in the latter half of fiscal 2021.•Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2021 increased to $3.54, compared to EPS of $0.79 in fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lapping the adverse impacts of COVID-19 in prior year. Also contributing to the increase was a $0.56 gain net of estimated taxes on the divestiture of our South Korea joint venture and $0.10 related to the extra week in fiscal 2021.•Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020.•We returned $2.1 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2021 through dividends. We returned $3.6 billion in fiscal 2020 through share repurchases and dividends. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in March 2020. Due to our business recovery and restoration of certain leverage metrics, we have resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.Acquisitions and DivestituresSee Note 2, Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.27Table of ContentsRESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2021 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2020 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):RevenuesFiscal Year EndedOct 3,2021Sep 27,2020%ChangeNet revenues:Company-operated stores$24,607.0 $19,164.6 28.4 %Licensed stores2,683.6 2,327.1 15.3 Other 1,770.0 2,026.3 (12.6)Total net revenues$29,060.6 $23,518.0 23.6 %Total net revenues increased $5.5 billion, or 24%, over fiscal 2020, primarily due to higher revenues from company-operated stores ($5.4 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenue was driven by a 20% increase in comparable store sales ($3.8 billion), attributable to a 9% increase in comparable transactions and a 10% increase in average ticket, the incremental revenues from 524 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings, or a 3% increase, over the past 12 months ($782 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($496 million) and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation ($359 million).Licensed stores revenue of $357 million also contributed to the increase in total net revenues, driven by higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($270 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($57 million) and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation ($28 million).Other revenues decreased $256 million, primarily driven by the transition of certain single-serve product activities to Nestlé. Partially offsetting this decrease was growth in our ready-to-drink business ($43 million) and the impact of the extra fiscal week in fiscal 2021 ($23 million).Operating ExpensesFiscal Year EndedOct 3,2021Sep 27,2020Oct 3,2021Sep 27,2020As a % of TotalNet RevenuesProduct and distribution costs$8,738.7 $7,694.9 30.1 %32.7 %Store operating expenses 11,930.9 10,764.0 41.1 45.8 Other operating expenses359.5 430.3 1.2 1.8 Depreciation and amortization expenses1,441.7 1,431.3 5.0 6.1 General and administrative expenses1,932.6 1,679.6 6.7 7.1 Restructuring and impairments170.4 278.7 0.6 1.2 Total operating expenses24,573.8 22,278.8 84.6 94.7 Income from equity investees385.3 322.5 1.3 1.4 Operating income$4,872.1 $1,561.7 16.8 %6.6 %Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues48.5 %56.2 %Product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 260 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage driven by lapping the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year and pricing in North America in the current year. These decreases were partially offset by increased supply chain costs due to accelerated inflationary pressures in the latter half of fiscal 2021.Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 470 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues decreased 770 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage from business recovery and lapping higher COVID-19 related costs in the prior year, mainly catastrophe and service pay for store partners, net of temporary subsidies from the U.S. and certain foreign governments (approximately 190 basis points) and labor efficiencies (approximately 110 basis points). These decreases were partially offset by enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits (approximately 140 basis points).28Table of ContentsOther operating expenses decreased $71 million, primarily due to lower Global Coffee Alliance transaction costs, inclusive of lapping integration costs for the Global Coffee Alliance and a change of a related accrual estimate in fiscal 2021.Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 110 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage.General and administrative expenses increased $253 million, primarily due to higher performance-based compensation, recognizing the strength of the Company's overall recovery from pandemic-related business impacts ($111 million), incremental strategic investments in technology ($89 million), increased partner wages and benefits ($26 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($22 million).Restructuring and impairment expenses decreased $108 million, primarily due to lower asset impairment related to our North America store portfolio optimization ($65 million), lapping the intangible asset impairment from the prior year ($22 million) and lower severance costs.Income from equity investees increased $63 million, primarily due to higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture ($30 million) and growth in our South Korea joint venture prior to divestiture ($22 million). We expect lower income from equity method investments in the future as a result of the sale of our South Korea joint venture (see Note 2); however, we do not expect this transaction to have a material impact on future revenue and operating margin trends.The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 1,020 basis points in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020.Other Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedOct 3,2021Sep 27,2020Oct 3,2021Sep 27,2020 As a % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income$4,872.1 $1,561.7 16.8 %6.6 %Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations 864.5 — 3.0 — Interest income and other, net90.1 39.7 0.3 0.2 Interest expense(469.8)(437.0)(1.6)(1.9)Earnings before income taxes5,356.9 1,164.4 18.4 5.0 Income tax expense1,156.6 239.7 4.0 1.0 Net earnings including noncontrolling interests4,200.3 924.7 14.5 3.9 Net earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests1.0 (3.6)— — Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$4,199.3 $928.3 14.5 %3.9 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests21.6 %20.6 %Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations increased $865 million due to the sale of our ownership interest in our South Korea joint venture.Interest income and other, net increased $50 million, primarily due to additional income from certain investments and net favorable fair value adjustments from derivatives used to manage our commodity price fluctuation risk.Interest expense increased $33 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in March 2020 and May 2020.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 21.6% compared to 20.6% for fiscal 2020. The increase was due to the foreign rate differential on our jurisdictional mix of earnings (approximately 380 basis points) as well as higher pre-tax income in fiscal 2021, which resulted in lower rate benefits from several discrete items, including stock-based compensation excess tax benefits (approximately 380 basis points), the release of income tax reserves upon expiration of statute of limitations (approximately 150 basis points) and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to an enacted foreign corporate rate change (approximately 80 basis points). These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by lapping valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets of certain international jurisdictions in the prior year (approximately 990 basis points).

Also contributing to these increases were the performance of new stores compared to the closure of underperforming stores, including stores related to our restructuring plan ($394 million), higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($151 million) primarily due to lapping the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year and favorable foreign currency translation ($76 million).Operating MarginNorth America operating income for fiscal 2021 increased 136% to $4.3 billion, compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2020. Operating margin increased 970 basis points to 20.8%, primarily due to sales leverage from business recovery and lapping higher COVID-19 related costs in the prior year, mainly catastrophe and service pay for store partners, net of temporary subsidies provided by the CARES Act and CEWS (approximately 180 basis points). Also contributing to the margin improvements were pricing (approximately 130 basis points), lower restructuring expenses (approximately 80 basis points) and benefits from the closure of lower-performing stores (approximately 60 basis points). These increases were partially offset by enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits (approximately 150 basis points) and, to a lesser extent, increased supply chain costs due to accelerated inflationary pressures in the latter half of fiscal 2021.30Table of ContentsInternational (1)Fiscal Year EndedOct 3,2021Sep 27,2020Oct 3,2021Sep 27,2020As a % of International Total Net RevenuesNet revenues:Company-operated stores$5,869.7 $4,385.8 84.8 %83.8 %Licensed stores981.4 817.2 14.2 15.6 Other70.5 27.6 1.0 0.5 Total net revenues6,921.6 5,230.6 100.0 100.0 Product and distribution costs2,187.3 1,729.1 31.6 33.1 Store operating expenses2,571.4 2,276.0 37.2 43.5 Other operating expenses147.3 153.6 2.1 2.9 Depreciation and amortization expenses544.7 518.4 7.9 9.9 General and administrative expenses360.5 286.4 5.2 5.5 Restructuring and impairments— (1.2)— — Total operating expenses5,811.2 4,962.3 84.0 94.9 Income from equity investees135.3 102.3 2.0 2.0 Operating income$1,245.7 $370.6 18.0 %7.1 %(1)International licensed store revenues, total net revenues, product and distribution costs, other operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, total operating expenses and operating income for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2020, have been restated to conform with current period presentation.RevenuesInternational total net revenues for fiscal 2021 increased $1.7 billion, or 32%, primarily due to a 16% increase in comparable store sales ($697 million), driven by a 14% increase in transactions and a 1% increase in average ticket.

This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($81 million) and higher performance-based compensation, due to better than expected business recovery ($57 million).FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash and Investment OverviewOur cash and investments were $6.9 billion and $4.8 billion as of October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper. As of October 3, 2021, approximately $2.9 billion of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing capacityCredit Facilities and Commercial PaperOur total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $3.0 billion as of the end of fiscal 2021.Revolving Lines of CreditDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we replaced our $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the “2018 credit facility”) and our $1.0 billion unsecured 364-Day credit facility (the “364-day credit facility”) with a new $3.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the “2021 credit facility”).Our 2021 credit facility, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The 2021 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The “Base Rate” of interest is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.025%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1.025%. The 2021 credit facility is available for general corporate purposes. As of October 3, 2021, we had no borrowings under the 2021 credit facility.Commercial Paper33Table of ContentsUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under the 2021 credit facility discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 3, 2021, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program.Credit Facilities in JapanAdditionally, we hold Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities which are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market.•A ¥5 billion, or $44.9 million, facility is currently set to mature on December 30, 2021. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.400%.•A ¥10 billion, or $89.9 million, facility is currently set to mature on March 26, 2022. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus 0.350%.As of October 3, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.See Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.Our ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the long-term notes were issued. As of October 3, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of CashWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our “Growth at Scale” agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.We believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. However, significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases. If necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances.We regularly review our cash positions and our determination of partial indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or another portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. We currently do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. See Note 14, Income Taxes, for further discussion.During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we replaced our $2.0 billion 2018 credit facility and our $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility with a new $3.0 billion 2021 credit facility. The 2021 credit facility was not drawn on in fiscal 2021 and is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026.During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.41 per share. On September 30, 2020, and for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.45 per share. Dividends are generally paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in 34Table of Contentsfiscal 2021 and 2020 totaled $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.49 per share to be paid on November 26, 2021, with an expected payout of approximately $578.1 million. In March 2019, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASR agreements”) with third-party financial institutions totaling $2.0 billion, effective March 22, 2019. We made a $2.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 22.2 million shares of our common stock. In June 2019, we received an additional 3.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $76.50.Outside of the ASR agreements noted above, we repurchased 36.6 million shares of common stock for $3.1 billion on the open market during the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019. In total, we repurchased 139.6 million shares at a total cost of $10.1 billion for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019.Our Board of Directors approved an increase of 120 million and 40 million shares to our ongoing share repurchase program during the fiscal first quarter of 2019 and fiscal second quarter of 2020, respectively. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in March 2020. Prior to the suspension, we repurchased 20.3 million shares of common stock for $1.7 billion on the open market during the year ended September 27, 2020. As of October 3, 2021, 48.9 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. Due to our business recovery and restoration of certain leverage metrics, we have resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.Other than operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2022 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores, our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are expected to be approximately $2 billion.The following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of October 3, 2021, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows (in millions): Material Cash RequirementsTotalLess than 1Year1 - 3Years3 - 5YearsMore than5 YearsOperating lease obligations(1)$10,129.9 $1,504.6 $2,751.5 $2,169.1 $3,704.7 Debt obligationsPrincipal payments14,713.8 1,000.0 2,513.8 1,750.0 9,450.0 Interest payments6,639.0 457.1 840.7 730.1 4,611.1 Purchase obligations(2)1,800.2 1,202.6 533.9 63.7 — Other obligations(3)368.4 54.6 92.6 136.5 84.7 Total$33,651.3 $4,218.9 $6,732.5 $4,849.4 $17,850.5 (1)Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses.(2)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 96% of total purchase obligations.(3)Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of long-term income taxes payable, asset retirement obligations and equity investment capital commitments.Cash FlowsCash provided by operating activities was $6.0 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $1.6 billion for fiscal 2020. The change was primarily due to higher net earnings and lapping the U.S. federal tax payment related to the Nestlé transaction in fiscal 2020.Cash used in investing activities totaled $0.3 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2020. The change was primarily driven by net proceeds from the divestiture of our ownership interest in our South Korea joint venture and higher maturities and calls of investments. This was partially offset by a decrease in sales of investments and higher capital contributions to equity method investments.Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2021 totaled $3.7 billion, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1.7 billion for fiscal 2020. The change was primarily due to lower net proceeds from borrowing activities and higher debt repayments, partially offset by the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program.35Table of ContentsCOMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONSCommodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. We also use cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and foreign exchange exposure of net investments in Japan. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.Commodity Price RiskWe purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 3, 2021 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices.

However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. The volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. 36Table of ContentsThe following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 3, 2021 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates.

Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of October 3, 2021 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.Interest Rate RiskLong-term DebtWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of October 3, 2021.The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of October 3, 2021 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): Change in Fair ValueFair Value100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying RateLong-term debt(1)$16,014 $1,216 $(1,216)(1)Amount disclosed is net of $13 million change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap. Refer to Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge.Available-for-Sale Debt SecuritiesOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of October 3, 2021 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, especially in light of the current economic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.Our significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise. We believe that our significant accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity for the reasons discussed below:37Table of ContentsProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived AssetsWe evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions or comparable company analyses.Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. The fair value of a store’s ROU asset is estimated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. In fiscal 2020, we announced a restructuring plan to optimize our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense metropolitan markets, by developing new store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. As of October 3, 2021, 807 stores in the U.S. and Canada were identified for closure, and substantially all were closed under the plan. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we recorded approximately $155.4 million and $254.7 million, respectively, to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. These totals included $53.1 million and $151.0 million, respectively, related to impairment and disposition of company-operated store assets and $89.5 million and $87.7 million, respectively, primarily associated with accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms. We expect total future restructuring costs under this plan, which are attributable to our North America segment, to be immaterial.Asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post COVID-19, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based 38Table of Contentson the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. Our goodwill impairment assessments were not significantly altered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the U.S. and China, we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months. Our fiscal 2021 annual goodwill impairment testing, which was completed in the third fiscal quarter, resulted in an estimated fair value of our reporting units where a quantitative assessment was performed, was in excess of carrying value of approximately $74 billion. When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group’s forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post COVID-19, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months.Definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, such as the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, we do not expect a significant amount of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized by the end of fiscal 2022 for reasons such as a lapse of the statute of limitations or resolution of examinations with tax authorities.We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated as our plans are based on our estimated working and other capital needs in jurisdictions where our earnings are generated. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material.39Table of ContentsOur income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted business performance could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Commodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Report.40Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:45:33.844353
829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2022,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021.OverviewWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.Our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales and margin management. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:•New store openings and store count•Comparable store sales•Operating marginStarbucks results for fiscal 2022 demonstrate the resiliency and strength of our brand. Consolidated revenues increased 11% to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $29.1 billion in fiscal 2021, primarily driven by strength in our U.S. business and growth in our International segment excluding China, partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($496 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation.For both the North America segment and U.S. market, comparable store sales increased 12% for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 22% and 21% for the North America segment and the U.S. market, respectively, in fiscal 2021. Average ticket for the North America segment and the U.S. market grew 7% and 8%, respectively, primarily driven by strategic pricing and increased demand for food items in our U.S. market. The segment also experienced higher costs, primarily related to investments and growth in labor including enhanced store partner wages as well as increased spend on new partner training. Also contributing were inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain. In fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. We believe the investments in partner wages and training will increase retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies will provide additional convenience and connection with our customers.For the International segment, comparable store sales decreased by 9% for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 16% in fiscal 2021, driven by comparable store sales decline of 24% in our China market. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022, our China market experienced COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility. Outside of China, strong growth in our major International markets, driven by product innovation and increasing digital capabilities, partially offset the unfavorability in our China market.Revenue for our Channel Development segment increased $250 million, or 16%, when compared with fiscal 2021, driven by higher product sales to and royalty revenue from the Global Coffee Alliance and growth in our global ready-to-drink business. Operating margin decreased 520 basis points to 44.3%, primarily due to a decline in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income due to inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints as well as business mix shift.Despite COVID-19 induced business interruptions, especially in our China market, we have seen the strength and resilience of our brand as well as strong customer demand across our portfolio. We expect inflationary pressures on commodities and supply chain to continue to a lesser extent in fiscal 2023, relative to the impact on our business and financial metrics, including operating margin, as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate that these should be offset by benefits from pricing decisions as well as from increased sales leverage and higher productivity driven by our Reinvention Plan. Absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts on the Reinvention Plan, we are confident in the strength of our brand and strategy for sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term.26Table of ContentsFinancial Highlights•Total net revenues increased 11% to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $29.1 billion in fiscal 2021, inclusive of $576 million attributable to the extra week in fiscal 2021.•Consolidated operating income decreased to $4.6 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $4.9 billion in fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2022 operating margin was 14.3% compared to 16.8% in fiscal 2021. Operating margin contraction of 250 basis points was primarily due to investments and growth in labor, including enhanced retail store partner wages (approximately 290 basis points) as well as increased spend on new partner training and support costs (approximately 80 basis points). Also contributing were inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain (approximately 270 basis points), sales deleverage related to COVID-19 pandemic related impacts in our China market (approximately 110 basis points), business mix shift (approximately 60 basis points) and lower government subsidies (approximately 60 basis points). These increases were partially offset by sales leverage across markets outside of China (approximately 390 basis points) and strategic pricing, primarily in North America (approximately 320 basis points).•Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2022 decreased to $2.83, compared to EPS of $3.54 in fiscal 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by lapping the prior year $0.56 gain, net of estimated taxes, on the divestiture of our South Korea joint venture and $0.10 related to the extra week in fiscal 2021. Also contributing were investments in labor and inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain, partially offset by growth in comparable store sales and lower restructuring costs.•Capital expenditures were $1.8 billion in fiscal 2022 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2021.•We returned $6.3 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2022 through share repurchases and dividends. We returned $2.1 billion in fiscal 2021 through dividends. In April 2022, we announced a temporary suspension of our share repurchase program to allow us to augment investments in our stores and partners. We resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.Acquisitions and DivestituresSee Note 2, Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):RevenuesFiscal Year EndedOct 2,2022Oct 3,2021%ChangeNet revenues:Company-operated stores$26,576.1 $24,607.0 8.0 %Licensed stores3,655.5 2,683.6 36.2 Other 2,018.7 1,770.0 14.1 Total net revenues$32,250.3 $29,060.6 11.0 %Total net revenues increased $3.2 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher revenues from company-operated stores ($2.0 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenue was driven by an 8% increase in comparable store sales ($1.8 billion) attributed to a 5% increase in average ticket and 2% increase in comparable transactions. Also contributing were the incremental revenues from 1,120 net new Starbucks company-operated store openings, or a 7% increase, over the past 12 months ($1.0 billion). Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($496 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation ($368 million).Licensed stores revenue increased $972 million, primarily driven by higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($922 million) and the conversion of our Korea market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ($187 million). Partially offsetting these increases were unfavorable foreign currency translation ($81 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($57 million).Other revenues increased $249 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance ($216 million) and growth in our ready-to-drink business ($44 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($23 million).27Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesFiscal Year EndedOct 2,2022Oct 3,2021Oct 2,2022Oct 3,2021As a % of TotalNet RevenuesProduct and distribution costs$10,317.4 $8,738.7 32.0 %30.1 %Store operating expenses 13,561.8 11,930.9 42.1 41.1 Other operating expenses461.5 359.5 1.4 1.2 Depreciation and amortization expenses1,447.9 1,441.7 4.5 5.0 General and administrative expenses2,032.0 1,932.6 6.3 6.7 Restructuring and impairments46.0 170.4 0.1 0.6 Total operating expenses27,866.6 24,573.8 86.4 84.6 Income from equity investees234.1 385.3 0.7 1.3 Operating income$4,617.8 $4,872.1 14.3 %16.8 %Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues51.0 %48.5 %Product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 190 basis points, primarily due to higher supply chain costs due to inflationary pressures.Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 100 basis points.

Also contributing were lower temporary government subsidies (approximately 70 basis points). These increases were partially offset by sales leverage.Other operating expenses increased $102 million, primarily due to lapping a change in estimate relating to a transaction cost accrual ($23 million), higher support costs for our growing North America and International licensed stores ($22 million), transaction costs associated with our Russia market exit ($20 million) and strategic investments in technology and other initiatives ($15 million).Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 50 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage.General and administrative expenses increased $99 million, primarily due to incremental investments in technology ($92 million), increased partner wages and benefits ($59 million) and higher support costs to address labor market conditions ($36 million). These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($95 million).Restructuring and impairment expenses decreased $124 million, primarily due to lower costs incurred related to our Reinvention Plan in the current year compared to prior year's North America store portfolio optimization, including lower accelerated lease right-of-use asset amortization costs ($84 million) and asset impairment charges ($68 million), partially offset by higher professional fees and higher severance costs ($27 million).Income from equity investees decreased $151 million, primarily due to the conversion of our Korea market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ($140 million) and lower income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture ($18 million).The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 250 basis points in fiscal 2022 when compared to fiscal 2021.28Table of ContentsOther Income and ExpensesFiscal Year EndedOct 2,2022Oct 3,2021Oct 2,2022Oct 3,2021 As a % of TotalNet RevenuesOperating income$4,617.8 $4,872.1 14.3 %16.8 %Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations — 864.5 — 3.0 Interest income and other, net97.0 90.1 0.3 0.3 Interest expense(482.9)(469.8)(1.5)(1.6)Earnings before income taxes4,231.9 5,356.9 13.1 18.4 Income tax expense948.5 1,156.6 2.9 4.0 Net earnings including noncontrolling interests3,283.4 4,200.3 10.2 14.5 Net earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests1.8 1.0 0.0 0.0 Net earnings attributable to Starbucks$3,281.6 $4,199.3 10.2 %14.5 %Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests22.4 %21.6 %Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations decreased $865 million due to lapping the sale of our ownership interest in our South Korea joint venture in the prior year.Interest expense increased $13 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in February 2022.The effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 22.4% compared to 21.6% for fiscal 2021. The increase was due to lapping a prior year remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to an enacted foreign corporate rate change (approximately 130 basis points) and lapping the release of income tax reserves upon expiration of statute of limitations (approximately 70 basis points), partially offset by the release of valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets of a certain international jurisdiction (approximately 120 basis points). See Note 14, Income Taxes, for further discussion.The Inflation Reduction Act was enacted on August 16, 2022, and includes a new 15% minimum tax on “adjusted financial statement income” beginning with the Company’s fiscal year 2024, and a new 1% excise tax on stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. While these tax law changes have no immediate effect and are not expected to have a material impact on our future financial results, we will continue to evaluate its impact as further information becomes available.29Table of ContentsSegment InformationResults of operations by segment (in millions):North AmericaFiscal Year EndedOct 2,2022Oct 3,2021Oct 2,2022Oct 3,2021As a % of North AmericaTotal Net RevenuesNet revenues:Company-operated stores$21,214.2 $18,737.3 90.8 %91.6 %Licensed stores2,150.5 1,702.2 9.2 8.3 Other 6.1 8.4 0.0 0.0 Total net revenues23,370.8 20,447.9 100.0 100.0 Product and distribution costs6,677.2 5,453.8 28.6 26.7 Store operating expenses10,860.0 9,359.5 46.5 45.8 Other operating expenses202.1 166.0 0.9 0.8 Depreciation and amortization expenses808.4 753.9 3.5 3.7 General and administrative expenses303.3 300.0 1.3 1.5 Restructuring and impairments33.3 155.4 0.1 0.8 Total operating expenses18,884.3 16,188.6 80.8 79.2 Operating income$4,486.5 $4,259.3 19.2 %20.8 %RevenuesNorth America total net revenues for fiscal 2022 increased $2.9 billion, or 14%, primarily due to a 12% increase in comparable store sales ($2.2 billion) driven by a 7% increase in average ticket and a 5% increase in transaction. Also contributing to these increases were the performance of net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($628 million) and higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($487 million), primarily due to business recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($427 million).Operating MarginNorth America operating income for fiscal 2022 increased 5% to $4.5 billion, compared to $4.3 billion in fiscal 2021. Operating margin decreased 160 basis points to 19.2%, primarily due to investments and growth in labor, including enhanced retail store partner wages (approximately 350 basis points) as well as increased spend on new partner training and support costs (approximately 120 basis points). Also contributing were inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain (approximately 350 basis points). These were partially offset by strategic pricing (approximately 400 basis points) and sales leverage.30Table of ContentsInternationalFiscal Year EndedOct 2,2022Oct 3,2021Oct 2,2022Oct 3,2021As a % of International Total Net RevenuesNet revenues:Company-operated stores$5,361.9 $5,869.7 77.3 %84.8 %Licensed stores1,505.0 981.4 21.7 14.2 Other73.2 70.5 1.1 1.0 Total net revenues6,940.1 6,921.6 100.0 100.0 Product and distribution costs2,357.7 2,187.3 34.0 31.6 Store operating expenses2,701.8 2,571.4 38.9 37.2 Other operating expenses191.4 147.3 2.8 2.1 Depreciation and amortization expenses513.0 544.7 7.4 7.9 General and administrative expenses345.3 360.5 5.0 5.2 Total operating expenses6,109.2 5,811.2 88.0 84.0 Income from equity investees2.3 135.3 0.0 2.0 Operating income$833.2 $1,245.7 12.0 %18.0 %RevenuesInternational total net revenues for fiscal 2022 increased $19 million, or 0.3%, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($435 million), mainly due to continuing business improvement from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, there were 765 net new Starbucks company-operated stores, or a 11% increase over the past 12 months ($406 million). Also contributing to the increase was the conversion of our Korea market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ($187 million). These were partially offset by a 9% decline in comparable store sales ($459 million), driven by a 5% decrease in customer transactions and a 4% decrease in average ticket, primarily attributable to COVID-19 related restrictions in China and lapping the prior-year value-added-tax benefit in China, unfavorable foreign currency translation ($436 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($127 million).Operating MarginInternational operating income for fiscal 2022 decreased 33% to $833.2 million, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021. Operating margin decreased 600 basis points to 12.0%, primarily due to sales deleverage related to COVID-19 pandemic impacts in our China market (approximately 460 basis points), investments and growth in retail store partner wages and benefits (approximately 140 basis points), lower temporary government subsidies (approximately 100 basis points), higher commodity and supply chain costs due to inflationary pressures (approximately 90 basis points) and strategic initiatives (approximately 90 basis points). These decreases were partially offset by sales leverage across markets outside of China.31Table of ContentsChannel DevelopmentFiscal Year EndedOct 2,2022Oct 3,2021Oct 2,2022Oct 3,2021As a % of Channel Development Total Net RevenuesNet revenues$1,843.6 $1,593.6 Product and distribution costs1,194.2 1,011.2 64.8 %63.5 %Other operating expenses51.6 31.3 2.8 2.0 Depreciation and amortization expenses0.1 1.2 0.0 0.1 General and administrative expenses12.2 10.8 0.7 0.7 Total operating expenses1,258.1 1,054.5 68.2 66.2 Income from equity investees231.8 250.0 12.6 15.7 Operating income$817.3 $789.1 44.3 %49.5 %RevenuesChannel Development total net revenues for fiscal 2022 increased $250 million, or 16%, compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher Global Coffee Alliance product sales and royalty revenue ($216 million) and growth in our ready-to-drink business ($44 million).

This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($84 million), increased support costs to address labor market conditions ($36 million) and increased partner wages and benefits ($31 million). These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($62 million).FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCESCash and Investment OverviewOur cash and investments were $3.5 billion and $6.9 billion as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of October 2, 2022, approximately $2.7 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing capacityCredit Facilities and Commercial PaperOur total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $2.8 billion as of the end of fiscal 2022.Revolving Lines of CreditOur $3.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the “2021 credit facility”), of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The 2021 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The “Base Rate” of interest is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1.000%. As of October 2, 2022, we had no borrowings under the 2021 credit facility.Commercial PaperUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under the 33Table of Contents2021 credit facility discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 2, 2022, we had $175.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program.Credit Facilities in JapanAdditionally, we hold Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities which are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market.•A ¥5 billion, or $34.6 million, facility is currently set to mature on December 31, 2022. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.400%.•A ¥10 billion, or $69.2 million, facility is currently set to mature on March 27, 2023. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus 0.350%.As of October 2, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.See Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.Our ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the long-term notes were issued. As of October 2, 2022, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of CashWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.We believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally, combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt, will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for at least the next 12 months. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months.We regularly review our cash positions and our determination of partial indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or another portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. We currently do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. See Note 14, Income Taxes, for further discussion.During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2021, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.45 per share. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, and for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, we declared a cash dividend of $0.49 per share. Dividends are generally paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2022 and 2021 totaled $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we declared a cash dividend of $0.53 per share to be paid on November 25, 2022, with an expected payout of approximately $608.3 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we resumed our share repurchase program which had been temporarily suspended in March 2020. During the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022, we repurchased 36.3 million shares of common stock for $4.0 billion on the open market. On March 15, 2022, we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 40 million shares under our ongoing share repurchase program. On April 4, 2022, we announced a temporary suspension of our share repurchase program to allow us to augment investments in our stores and partners. Repurchases pursuant to this program were last made on April 1, 2022. As of October 2, 2022, 52.6 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. We have resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.34Table of ContentsOther than operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2023 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores, our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 are expected to be approximately $2.5 billion.The following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of October 2, 2022, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows (in millions): Material Cash RequirementsTotalLess than 1Year1 - 3Years3 - 5YearsMore than5 YearsOperating lease obligations(1)$9,863.7 $1,473.5 $2,729.2 $2,121.4 $3,539.6 Debt obligationsPrincipal payments15,038.4 1,000.0 3,088.4 1,000.0 9,950.0 Interest payments6,499.8 487.3 865.2 725.3 4,422.0 Purchase obligations(2)1,354.5 1,030.1 324.4 — — Other obligations(3)401.6 125.0 118.7 84.6 73.3 Total$33,158.0 $4,115.9 $7,125.9 $3,931.3 $17,984.9 (1)Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses.(2)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 99% of total purchase obligations.(3)Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of long-term income taxes payable, asset retirement obligations and equity investment capital commitments.Cash FlowsCash provided by operating activities was $4.4 billion for fiscal 2022, compared to $6.0 billion for fiscal 2021. The change was primarily due to lower net earnings and an increase in inventory purchases and timing of income tax payments.Cash used in investing activities totaled $2.1 billion for fiscal 2022, compared to $0.3 billion for fiscal 2021. The change was primarily driven by lapping the net proceeds from the divestiture of our ownership interest in our South Korea joint venture and an increase in spend on capital expenditures.Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2022 totaled $5.6 billion, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $3.7 billion for fiscal 2021. The change was primarily due to resuming our share repurchase program, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt.COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONSCommodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and speculative trading activities are prohibited. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. We also use cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and foreign exchange exposure of net investments in Japan. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, and Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.35Table of ContentsThe sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.Commodity Price RiskWe purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 2, 2022 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): Increase/(Decrease) to Net EarningsIncrease/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate10% Increase inUnderlying Rate10% Decrease inUnderlying RateCommodity hedges$3.0 $(3.0)$74 $(74)Foreign Currency Exchange RiskThe majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. The volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 2, 2022 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): Increase/(Decrease) to Net EarningsIncrease/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate10% Increase inUnderlying Rate10% Decrease inUnderlying RateForeign currency hedges$46 $(46)$155 $(155)Equity Security Price RiskWe have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of October 2, 2022 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.36Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskLong-term DebtWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of October 2, 2022.The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of October 2, 2022 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): Change in Fair ValueFair Value100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying RateLong-term debt(1)$13,052 $1,100 $(1,100)(1)Amount disclosed is net of $28 million change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap. Refer to Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge.Available-for-Sale Debt SecuritiesOur available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of October 2, 2022 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, especially in light of the current economic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.Our significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise. We believe that our significant accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity for the reasons discussed below:37Table of ContentsProperty, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived AssetsWe evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions or comparable company analyses.Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. The fair value of a store’s ROU asset is estimated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. In fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded an immaterial impairment charge on our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022. Future impairment charges attributed to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material.In fiscal 2021, we substantially completed our plan to reposition our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense metropolitan markets by pursuing strategic store closures and focusing on new store formats that better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. During fiscal year 2021, we recorded approximately $155.4 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. These totals included $53.1 million related to disposal and impairment of company-operated store assets and $89.5 million primarily associated with accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms. As this restructuring plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2021, we did not recognize any material restructuring and impairment amounts related to this plan during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022.Asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance 38Table of Contentsand forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post COVID-19, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. Our goodwill impairment assessments were not significantly altered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the U.S. and China, we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months. Our fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment testing, which was completed in the third fiscal quarter, resulted in an estimated fair value of our reporting units where a quantitative assessment was performed, was in excess of carrying value of approximately $95 billion for the business units where a quantitative analysis on impairment was performed. When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group’s forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post COVID-19, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months.Definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, such as the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, we do not expect a significant amount of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized by the end of fiscal 2023 for reasons such as a lapse of the statute of limitations or resolution of examinations with tax authorities.We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated as our plans are based on our estimated working and other capital needs in jurisdictions where our earnings are generated. While we do not expect to 39Table of Contentsrepatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material.Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted business performance, could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTSSee Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskThe information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Commodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Report.40Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:45:43.325197
829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2023,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022.OverviewWe have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other.Our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales and margin management. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics:•New store openings and store count•Comparable store sales•Operating marginStarbucks results for fiscal 2023 demonstrate the overall strength of our brand. Consolidated revenues increased 12% to $36.0 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by strength in our U.S. business and growth in our International segment, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation.For both the North America segment and U.S. market, comparable store sales increased 9% for fiscal 2023 compared to an increase of 12% in fiscal 2022. Average ticket for both the North America segment and the U.S. market grew 6%, primarily driven by pricing in our U.S. market. The segment also experienced higher costs, primarily related to previously-committed investments in store partner wages and benefits and increased spend on partner training, as well as inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain. In fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. We believe the investments in partner wages and training have increased retention and in-store operational efficiencies while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies have provided additional convenience and connection with our customers.For the International segment, despite COVID-19 pandemic-related headwinds in China in the first half of the year, revenue grew 8% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily driven by net new company-operated store openings and higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees. Also contributing to the increase was a 5% increase in comparable store sales, driven by customer transactions, compared to a decrease of 9% in fiscal 2022. These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Revenue for our Channel Development segment increased 3% in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022, primarily driven by higher Global Coffee Alliance product sales and royalty revenue and growth in our global ready-to-drink business. In fiscal 2023, we sold the assets associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand to Nestlé, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $91.3 million. We have seen the strength and resilience of our brand as well as strong customer demand across our portfolio, with revenue and operating margin growth in fiscal 2023. We expect to continue our trend of global new store growth in fiscal 2024, driven by a dynamic portfolio of store formats in the U.S. and leveraging the strength of our brand internationally. We anticipate continued benefits from increased sales leverage and pricing decisions as well as in-store operational efficiencies driven by our Reinvention Plan. We expect the inflationary pressures on commodities and supply chain that impacted fiscal 2023 to moderate in fiscal 2024, relative to the impact on our business and financial metrics, including operating margin. Absent global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts on the Reinvention Plan, we are confident in the strength of our brand and strategy for sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term.28Table of ContentsFinancial Highlights•Total net revenues increased 12% to $36.0 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022.•Consolidated operating income increased to $5.9 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $4.6 billion in fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2023 operating margin was 16.3% compared to 14.3% in fiscal 2022. Operating margin expansion of 200 basis points was primarily due to pricing (approximately 250 basis points), sales leverage (approximately 240 basis points) and in-store operational efficiencies (approximately 160 basis points). These increases were partially offset by previously-committed investments in store partner wages (approximately 250 basis points) and higher general and administrative expenses, primarily in support of our Reinvention Plan (approximately 130 basis points).•Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2023 increased to $3.58, compared to EPS of $2.83 in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily driven by sales growth and in-store operational efficiencies. This increase was partially offset by previously-committed investments in store partner wages and higher general and administrative expenses, primarily in support of our Reinvention Plan.•Capital expenditures were $2.3 billion in fiscal 2023 and $1.8 billion in fiscal 2022.•We returned $3.4 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2023 through share repurchases and dividends. We returned $6.3 billion in fiscal 2022 through share repurchases and dividends.Acquisitions and DivestituresSee Note 2, Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2022 Consolidated results of operations (in millions):RevenuesFiscal Year EndedOct 1,2023Oct 2,2022%ChangeNet revenues:Company-operated stores$29,462.3 $26,576.1 10.9 %Licensed stores4,512.7 3,655.5 23.4 Other 2,000.6 2,018.7 (0.9)Total net revenues$35,975.6 $32,250.3 11.6 %Total net revenues increased $3.7 billion, or 12%, over fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher revenues from company-operated stores ($2.9 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenue was driven by an 8% increase in comparable store sales ($2.1 billion) attributed to a 5% increase in average ticket and 3% increase in comparable transactions. Also contributing were the incremental revenues from 1,339 net new Starbucks company-operated store openings, or a 7% increase, over the past 12 months ($1.2 billion). These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($555 million).Licensed stores revenue increased $857 million, primarily driven by higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($898 million), largely due to revenue growth from existing stores and the opening of 988 net new Starbucks licensed stores over the past 12 months, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($64 million).Other revenues decreased $18 million, primarily due to the absence of revenues from the Evolution Fresh business following its sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 ($60 million), partially offset by an increase in revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance ($37 million).29Table of ContentsOperating ExpensesFiscal Year EndedOct 1,2023Oct 2,2022Oct 1,2023Oct 2,2022As a % of TotalNet RevenuesProduct and distribution costs$11,409.1 $10,317.4 31.7 %32.0 %Store operating expenses 14,720.3 13,561.8 40.9 42.1 Other operating expenses539.4 461.5 1.5 1.4 Depreciation and amortization expenses1,362.6 1,447.9 3.8 4.5 General and administrative expenses2,441.3 2,032.0 6.8 6.3 Restructuring and impairments21.8 46.0 0.1 0.1 Total operating expenses30,494.5 27,866.6 84.8 86.4 Income from equity investees298.4 234.1 0.8 0.7 Gain from sale of assets91.3 — 0.3 — Operating income$5,870.8 $4,617.8 16.3 %14.3 %Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues50.0 %51.0 %Product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to pricing (approximately 120 basis points), partially offset by inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain (approximately 80 basis points).Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 120 basis points.

We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, fund acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of October 1, 2023, approximately $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing CapacityCredit Facilities and Commercial PaperRevolving Credit FacilityOur $3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “2021 credit facility”), of which $150.0 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The “Base Rate” is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%. Term SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%.The 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of October 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of October 1, 2023 or October 2, 2022.35Table of ContentsOur total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $3.0 billion as of the end of fiscal 2023.Commercial PaperUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our 2021 credit facility. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 1, 2023, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. As of October 2, 2022, we had $175.0 million in borrowings outstanding under this program.Credit Facilities in JapanAdditionally, we hold the following Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities that are are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market:•A ¥5 billion, or $33.5 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on January 4, 2024. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.400%.•A ¥10 billion, or $67.0 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on March 27, 2024. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.300%.As of October 1, 2023 we had ¥5 billion, or $33.5 million, of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. As of October 2, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities.See Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt.Our ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the long-term notes were issued. As of October 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of CashWe expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Furthermore, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy.We believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally, combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt, will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for at least the next 12 months. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases, refinancing debt maturities, as well as investing in new business opportunities. If necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances.We regularly review our cash positions and our determination of partial indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or another portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. While we do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity requirements, any foreign earnings which are not indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated at management’s discretion. See Note 14, Income Taxes, for further discussion.During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.49 per share. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, we declared a cash dividend of $0.53 per 36Table of Contentsshare. Dividends are generally paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2023 and 2022 totaled $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share to be paid on November 24, 2023, with an expected payout of approximately $651.2 million. During the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022, we repurchased 36.3 million shares of common stock for $4.0 billion on the open market. During the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023, we repurchased 10.0 million shares of common stock for $1.0 billion on the open market. On March 15, 2022, we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 40 million shares under our ongoing share repurchase program. As of October 1, 2023, 42.6 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations.Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2024 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores, our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 are expected to be approximately $3.0 billion.The following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of October 1, 2023, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows (in millions): Material Cash RequirementsTotalLess than 1Year1 - 3Years3 - 5YearsMore than5 YearsOperating lease obligations(1)$10,594.2 $1,577.6 $2,931.1 $2,206.9 $3,878.6 Debt obligationsPrincipal payments15,519.3 1,819.3 2,750.0 1,100.0 9,850.0 Interest payments6,362.2 520.8 909.3 740.6 4,191.5 Purchase obligations(2)1,078.4 694.6 311.4 72.4 — Other obligations(3)391.4 114.4 145.6 33.4 98.0 Total$33,945.5 $4,726.7 $7,047.4 $4,153.3 $18,018.1 (1)Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses.(2)Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 92% of total purchase obligations.(3)Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of long-term income taxes payable, asset retirement obligations, equity investment capital commitments and finance lease obligations.Cash FlowsCash provided by operating activities was $6.0 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $4.4 billion for fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to a decrease in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities, including lower inventory purchases driven by reduced coffee commodity prices, and higher net earnings during the period.Cash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $2.1 billion for fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to an increase in spend on capital expenditures and increased purchases of investments in fiscal 2023, partially offset by increased maturities and calls of investments in fiscal 2023.Cash used in financing activities was $3.0 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $5.6 billion for fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to a decrease in share repurchase activities, partially offset by an increase in net payments of commercial paper.COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONSCommodity price risk represents our primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K.FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENTMarket risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate 37Table of Contentsrisk. Risk limits are set annually and speculative trading activities are prohibited. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. We also use cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our net investments in foreign operations. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, and Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments.The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses.Commodity Price RiskWe purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure.The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 1, 2023 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): Increase/(Decrease) to Net EarningsIncrease/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate10% Increase inUnderlying Rate10% Decrease inUnderlying RateCommodity hedges$1.2 $(1.2)$33 $(33)Foreign Currency Exchange RiskThe majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. The volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 1, 2023 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates.

Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings.We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of October 1, 2023 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.38Table of ContentsInterest Rate RiskLong-term DebtWe utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3, Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9, Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of October 1, 2023.The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of October 1, 2023 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): Fair ValueDecrease in Fair Value for a 100 Basis Point Increase in Underlying RateLong-term debt(1)(2)$13,426 $(820)(1)Amount disclosed is net of $16 million change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swaps.

The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of October 1, 2023 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments.CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATESCritical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions.Our significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise. We believe that our significant accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity for the reasons discussed below:Income TaxesWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). 39Table of ContentsIn addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, such as the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated as our plans are based on our estimated working and other capital needs in jurisdictions where our earnings are generated. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted business performance, could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived AssetsWe evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions or comparable company analyses.Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. The fair value of a store’s ROU asset is estimated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. 40Table of ContentsIn fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded immaterial impairment charges on our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022. Future impairment charges attributed to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material.Asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible AssetsWe evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches.When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the U.S. and China, we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months. Our fiscal 2023 annual goodwill impairment testing was completed in the third fiscal quarter. Where a quantitative assessment was performed, the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded carrying value by approximately $101 billion.When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group’s forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months.Definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 8, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K.

829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2005,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Starbucks Corporation’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal years ended on October 2, 2005 and September 28, 2003, included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended October 3, 2004, included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fiscal fourth quarter. Management Overview During the fiscal year ended October 2, 2005, all areas of Starbucks business, from U.S. and International Company-operated retail operations to the Company’s specialty businesses, delivered strong financial performance. Starbucks believes the Company’s ability to achieve the balance between growing its core business and building the foundation for future growth is the key to increasing long-term shareholder value. Starbucks fiscal 2005 performance reflects the Company’s continuing commitment to achieving this balance. The primary driver of the Company’s revenue growth continues to be the opening of new retail stores, both Company-operated and licensed, in pursuit of the Company’s objective to establish Starbucks as the most recognized and respected brand in the world. Starbucks opened 1,672 new stores in fiscal 2005 and plans to open approximately 1,800 in fiscal 2006. With a presence in 37 countries, management continues to believe that the Company’s long-term goal of 15,000 Starbucks retail locations throughout the United States and at least 15,000 stores in International markets is achievable. In addition to opening new retail stores, Starbucks works to increase revenues generated at new and existing Company-operated stores by attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current 21 Table of Contents customers. The strategy is to increase comparable store sales by continuously improving the level of customer service, introducing innovative products and improving the speed of service through training, technology and process improvement. Global comparable store sales for Company-operated markets increased by 8%, making fiscal 2005 the 14th consecutive year with comparable store sales growth of five percent or greater. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2006 are expected to be in the range of three to seven percent. In licensed retail operations, Starbucks leverages the expertise of local partners and shares its operating and store development experience to help licensees improve the profitability of existing stores and build new stores. Internationally, the Company’s strategy is to selectively increase its equity stake in licensed international operations as these markets develop. The combination of more retail stores, higher revenues from existing stores and growth in other business channels in both the United States and International operating segments resulted in a 20% increase in total net revenues for the 52 weeks of fiscal 2005, compared to the 53 weeks of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, total net revenues increased 23%. Both of these revenue growth measures were at or above the Company’s three to five year target of approximately 20%. The Company’s International operations delivered improved operating results, primarily due to leverage gained on most operating expenses distributed over an expanded revenue base. In recent fiscal years, the Company made substantial infrastructure investments in corporate and regional support facilities and personnel, as well as established more efficient distribution networks. Such investments have been and will continue to be necessary to support the Company’s planned international expansion, which is now realizing substantial benefit from this foundation. Since both additional International and U.S. retail stores can leverage existing support organizations and facilities, the Company’s infrastructure can be expanded more slowly than the rate of revenue growth and generate margin improvement. In fiscal 2005, operating income as a percentage of total net revenues increased to 12.3% from 11.5% in fiscal 2004, and net earnings increased by 27%, compared to fiscal 2004. These results demonstrated the Company’s ability to improve operating margin while at the same time making strategic investments in the core retail business and in emerging specialty channels. Acquisitions During fiscal 2005, Starbucks increased its equity ownership in its licensed operations in Germany, Southern China and Chile, to 100%, 51% and 100%, respectively, for a combined purchase price of $41 million. Previously, the Company owned less than 20% in each of these operations, which were accounted for under the cost method. These increases in equity ownership resulted in a change of accounting method, from the cost method to the consolidation method, on the respective dates of acquisition. This accounting change also included adjusting previously reported information for the Company’s proportionate share of net losses in Germany, Southern China and Chile. The cumulative effect of the accounting change for previously reported information resulted in a reduction of net earnings of $0.1 million for the 39 weeks ended July 3, 2005, and a reduction of retained earnings of $4.0 million prior to fiscal 2005. In April 2005, Starbucks acquired substantially all of the assets of Ethos Brands, LLC, (“Ethos”), a privately held bottled water company based in Santa Monica, California, for $8 million. The earnings of Ethos are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 22 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 The following table presents the consolidated statement of earnings as well as the percentage relationship to total net revenues, unless otherwise indicated, of items included in the Company’s consolidated statements of earnings (amounts in thousands): Oct 2, 2005 % of Oct 3, 2004 % of Sept 28, 2003 % of Fiscal Year Ended (52 Wks) Revenues (53 Wks) Revenues (52 Wks) Revenues STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS DATA Net revenues: Company-operated retail $ 5,391,927 84.7 % $ 4,457,378 84.2 % $ 3,449,624 84.6 % Specialty: Licensing 673,015 10.5 565,798 10.7 409,551 10.1 Foodservice and other 304,358 4.8 271,071 5.1 216,347 5.3 Total specialty 977,373 15.3 836,869 15.8 625,898 15.4 Total net revenues 6,369,300 100.0 5,294,247 100.0 4,075,522 100.0 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 2,605,212 40.9 2,191,440 41.4 1,681,434 41.3 Store operating expenses 2,165,911 40.2 (1) 1,790,168 40.2 (1) 1,379,574 40.0 (1) Other operating expenses 197,024 20.2 (2) 171,648 20.5 (2) 141,346 22.6 (2) Depreciation and amortization expenses 340,169 5.3 289,182 5.5 244,671 6.0 General and administrative expenses 357,114 5.6 304,293 5.7 244,550 6.0 Subtotal operating expenses 5,665,430 88.9 4,746,731 89.7 3,691,575 90.6 Income from equity investees 76,745 1.2 59,071 1.1 36,903 0.9 Operating income 780,615 12.3 606,587 11.5 420,850 10.3 Interest and other income, net 15,829 0.2 14,140 0.2 11,622 0.3 Earnings before income taxes 796,444 12.5 620,727 11.7 432,472 10.6 Income taxes 301,977 4.7 231,754 4.4 167,117 4.1 Net earnings $ 494,467 7.8 % $ 388,973 7.3 % $ 265,355 6.5 % (1) Shown as a percentage of related Company-operated retail revenues.

Consolidated Results of Operations Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2005 increased 20% to $6.4 billion from $5.3 billion for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, driven by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. Net revenues increased 23% when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004. Net revenues are expected to grow approximately 20% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. During the fiscal year ended 2005, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased 21% to $5.4 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, 23 Table of Contents from $4.5 billion for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Company-operated retail revenues increased 23% when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 735 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 8% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 4% increase in the average value per transaction. Comparable store sales growth percentages were calculated excluding the extra week of fiscal 2004. Management believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by new product innovation, continued popularity of core products, a high level of customer satisfaction and improved speed of service through enhanced technology, training and execution at retail stores. The increase in the average value per transaction was primarily due to a beverage price increase in October 2004 in the Company’s U.S. and Canadian markets. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores, collectively known as “Specialty Operations.” Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 17% to $977 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $837 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, total specialty revenues increased 19%. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements, as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded-product licensed operations, increased 19% to $673 million for the 52 week period of 2005, from $566 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, total licensing revenues increased 21%, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 937 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 12% to $304 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $271 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, foodservice and other revenues increased 15%, primarily attributable to growth in new and existing U.S. and International foodservice accounts and, to a lesser extent, growth in the Company’s emerging entertainment business. Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased to 40.9% of total net revenues in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from 41.4% in the 53-week period of 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction, offset in part by higher initial costs associated with the continued expansion of a lunch program in Company-operated retail stores. Approximately 3,800 Company-operated stores had the lunch program at the end of fiscal 2005, compared to approximately 2,600 at the end of fiscal 2004. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues were 40.2% for both the 52-week period of fiscal 2005 and the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction in fiscal 2005, offset by higher payroll-related expenditures, as well as higher maintenance and repair expenditures to ensure a consistent Starbucks Experience in existing stores. In order to facilitate ongoing retail store revenue growth, the Company opened a higher number of drive-thru locations over the past year and extended store operating hours, which contributed to the higher payroll-related expenditures. Other operating expenses (expenses associated with the Company’s Specialty Operations) decreased to 20.2% of specialty revenues in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to 20.5% in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenditures within the grocery, warehouse club and foodservice businesses, partially offset by higher payroll-related expenditures to support the Company’s emerging entertainment business and to support the growth of Seattle’s Best Coffee licensed café operations. 24 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $340 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $289 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily from the opening of 735 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.3% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from 5.5% for the corresponding 53-week fiscal 2004 period. General and administrative expenses increased to $357 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to $304 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures in support of both domestic and international business growth and increased charitable donations to support multi-year corporate commitments. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.6% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from 5.7% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004. Income from equity investees increased to $77 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to $59 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to volume-driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino® coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot® espresso drink, and improved operating results from international investees, particularly in Japan and Korea, mainly as a result of new store openings. Operating income increased 29% to $781 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $607 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The operating margin increased to 12.3% of total net revenues in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to 11.5% in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to strong revenue growth. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, increased to $16 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $14 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher interest income earned due to higher interest rates in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and to foreign exchange gains in fiscal 2005 compared to losses in fiscal 2004. Partially offsetting these increases were higher realized losses on sales of available-for-sale securities. Starbucks funded the majority of its share repurchases during fiscal 2005 through sales of its available-for-sale securities. Income taxes for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.9%, compared to 37.3% in fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% due to a variety of factors, including state income taxes, the impact from foreign operations, tax credits and other provision adjustments. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 is expected to be approximately 38%, with quarterly variations. 25 Table of Contents Operating Segments Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Company’s management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes.

United States operations sells coffee and other beverages, whole bean coffees, complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and merchandise primarily through Company-operated retail stores. Specialty Operations within the United States include licensed retail stores and other licensing operations, foodservice accounts and other initiatives related to the Company’s core business. United States total net revenues increased 19% to $5.3 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $4.5 billion for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States total net revenues increased 21%. United States Company-operated retail revenues increased 19% to $4.5 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $3.8 billion for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States Company-operated retail revenues increased 22%, primarily due to the opening of 574 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 9% for the 52-week period of fiscal 2005. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in the average value per transaction, including 3% attributable to a beverage price increase in October 2004, and a 4% increase in the number of customer transactions. Management believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by new product innovation, continued popularity of core products, a high level of customer satisfaction and improved speed of service through enhanced technology, training and execution at retail stores. Total United States specialty revenues increased 15% to $795 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $690 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States specialty revenues increased 18%. United States licensing revenues increased 18% to $515 million, compared to $437 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States licensing revenues increased 20%, primarily due to increased product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 596 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 10% to $280 million from $254 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States foodservice and other revenues increased 13%, primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts, as well as growth in the emerging entertainment business. United States operating income increased by 24% to $946 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $763 million for the fiscal year ended 2004. Operating margin increased to 17.7% of related revenues from 17.0% in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to leverage from strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher retail store operating expenses primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures to facilitate ongoing retail store revenue growth. International The Company’s international operations (“International”) represent the remaining 16% of Company-operated retail revenues, 19% of total specialty revenues and 16% of total net revenues. International operations sells coffee and other beverages, whole bean coffees, complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through Company-operated retail stores in the United Kingdom, Canada, Thailand, Australia, Germany, Singapore, China, Chile and Ireland. Specialty Operations in International primarily include retail store licensing operations in more than 25 other countries and foodservice accounts in Canada and the United Kingdom. Certain of the Company’s International operations are in various early stages of development that 27 Table of Contents necessitate a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than in the United States. International total net revenues increased 29% to $1.0 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $803 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, International total net revenues increased 31%. International Company-operated retail revenues increased 30% to $852 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $657 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, International Company-operated revenues increased 32%, primarily due to the opening of 161 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of 6% for the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar against both the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a 4% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. Total International specialty revenues increased 25% to $182 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $146 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, International specialty revenues increased 27%. International licensing revenues increased 23% to $158 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $129 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, International licensing revenues increased 25%, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 341 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months, volume driven growth in the Canadian grocery and warehouse club businesses, and, to a lesser extent, the launch of new ready-to-drink coffee beverages in Japan and Taiwan. International foodservice and other revenues increased 38% to $24 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $18 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, international foodservice and other revenues increased 41%, primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. International operating income increased to $86 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $52 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Operating margin increased to 8.4% of related revenues from 6.4% in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to leverage gained on most fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base. Unallocated Corporate Unallocated corporate expenses pertain to certain functions, such as executive management, accounting, administration, tax, treasury and information technology infrastructure, that support but are not specifically attributable to the Company’s operating segments, and include related depreciation and amortization expenses. Unallocated corporate expenses increased to $252 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $208 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to increased charitable commitments as well as higher payroll-related expenditures. Total unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues remained unchanged at 3.9% for the fiscal year ended 2005 and the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. 28 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 Consolidated Results of Operations Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2004 increased 30% to $5.3 billion from $4.1 billion for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. Net revenues increased 27% when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003. During the fiscal year ended 2004, Starbucks derived 84% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased 29% to $4.5 billion for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $3.4 billion for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. Company-operated retail revenues increased 27% when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 634 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 10%. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 9% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 1% increase in the average value per transaction. Comparable store sales growth percentages were calculated excluding the extra week of fiscal 2004. The Company derived the remaining 16% of total net revenues from its Specialty Operations. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 34% to $837 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $626 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, total specialty revenues increased 31% to $820 million. Licensing revenues increased 38% to $566 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $410 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the addition of 710 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses. The growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses was a result of expanded agreements with Kraft Foods, Inc., which included the addition of six new Starbucks coffees along with a selection of Tazo® teas, and the acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Foodservice and other revenues increased 25% to $271 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $216 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to the growth in new and existing foodservice accounts, which benefited from the July 2003 acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased to 41.4% of total net revenues in fiscal 2004, from 41.3% in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs, partially offset by leverage gained on occupancy costs, which are primarily fixed expenses. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased to 40.2% in fiscal 2004, from 40.0% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher marketing expenditures for holiday and new product promotions, as well as increased costs to maintain retail stores and equipment due to sustained high traffic levels. Other operating expenses (expenses associated with the Company’s Specialty Operations) decreased to 20.5% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2004, compared to 22.6% in fiscal 2003. The decrease was primarily due to leverage gained on payroll-related expenditures distributed over an expanded revenue base. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $289 million in fiscal 2004, from $245 million in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to a net increase of 634 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and higher depreciation expenses associated with shortened estimated useful lives of equipment deployed in the Company’s foodservice operations. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.5% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from 6.0% for the corresponding 29 Table of Contents 52-week fiscal 2003 period, primarily due to the leverage of fixed depreciation expenses from the extra sales week in 2004. General and administrative expenses increased to $304 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $245 million in fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.7% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from 6.0% for the 52 weeks ended September 28, 2003. Income from equity investees was $59 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $37 million in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to volume-driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino® coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot® coffee drink, and improved profitability of Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd. (“Starbucks Japan”). The July 2003 increase in the Company’s ownership interest from 5% to 50% in the Taiwan and Shanghai licensed operations also contributed to the growth. Operating income increased 44% to $607 million in fiscal 2004, from $421 million in fiscal 2003. The operating margin increased to 11.5% of total net revenues in fiscal 2004, compared to 10.3% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to leverage gained on most fixed operating costs distributed over an expanded revenue base, partially offset by higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, increased to $14 million in fiscal 2004, from $12 million in fiscal 2003. The growth was a result of interest income earned on higher cash and liquid investment balances during fiscal 2004, compared to the prior year. Income taxes for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.3%, compared to 38.6% in fiscal 2003. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to improved operating results as fewer nondeductible losses were generated from international markets, which are in various phases of development. 30 Table of Contents Operating Segments Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Company’s management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes.

Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, United States total net revenues increased 27% to $4.4 billion. United States Company-operated retail revenues increased 28% to $3.8 billion for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $3.0 billion for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to the opening of 514 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 11%. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 10% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 1% increase in the average value per transaction. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, United States Company-operated retail revenues increased 26% to $3.7 billion. Total United States specialty revenues increased 36% to $690 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $507 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, United States specialty revenues increased 33% to $676 million. United States licensing revenues increased 45% to $437 million, compared to $301 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to volume-driven growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses as a result of expanded agreements with Kraft Foods Inc., which included the addition of six new Starbucks coffees along with a selection of Tazo® teas. In addition, product sales and royalty revenues increased as a result of opening 417 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 23% to $254 million from $206 million in fiscal 2003, due to both the addition of new and existing Starbucks and Seattle Coffee Company foodservice accounts. United States operating income increased by 26% to $763 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $604 million for the fiscal year ended 2003. Operating margin decreased to 17.0% of related revenues from 17.4% in the 52-week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs, as well as higher payroll-related expenditures to support the Company’s ongoing retail store growth. These increases were partially offset by leverage gained on fixed occupancy costs distributed over an expanded revenue base. International International total net revenues increased 33% to $803 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $603 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, International total net revenues increased 31%. International Company-operated retail revenues increased 36% to $657 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $484 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 120 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against both the British pound sterling and Canadian dollar, and comparable store sales growth of 6%. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 1% increase in the average value per transaction. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, International Company-operated retail revenues increased 33% to $644 million. Total International specialty revenues increased 23% to $146 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $119 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, International specialty revenues increased 21% to $144 million. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 293 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months, partially offset by proportionate eliminations of sales to equity investees in which the Company increased its ownership interest in late fiscal 2003. 32 Table of Contents International operating income increased to $52 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $4 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. Operating margin increased to 6.4% of related revenues from 0.6% in the 52-week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to leverage gained on most fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base. Unallocated Corporate Unallocated corporate expenses increased to $208 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $187 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation based on the Company’s performance and other payroll-related expenditures. Total unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased to 3.9% for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to 4.6% for the 52-week period of fiscal 2003. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table represents components of the Company’s most liquid assets (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2005 Oct 3, 2004 Cash and cash equivalents $ 173,809 $ 145,053 Short-term investments — available-for-sale 95,379 483,157 Short-term investments — trading securities 37,848 24,799 Long-term investments — available-for-sale securities 60,475 135,179 Total $ 367,511 $ 788,188 Starbucks has reclassified its auction rate securities of $154.1 million, previously classified in “Cash and cash equivalents,” as “Short-term investments — available-for-sale securities” on the consolidated balance sheet as of October 3, 2004. The Company had historically classified these securities as cash equivalents based on management’s ability to liquidate its holdings during the predetermined interest rate reset auctions, which generally occurred within 90 days of acquiring the securities. Although management had determined the risk of failure of an auction process to be remote, the definition of a cash equivalent in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, “Statement of Cash Flows,” required reclassification to short-term investments. The Company has made corresponding adjustments to its consolidated statement of cash flows for the prior fiscal years of 2004 and 2003 to reflect the gross purchases, sales and maturities of auction rate securities as investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents. There was no impact on previously reported cash flows from operating activities as a result of the reclassification. The Company manages its cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs. The $421 million decline in total cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments from October 3, 2004 to October 2, 2005, was nearly all due to the sale of securities to fund common stock repurchases. The Company intends to use its available cash resources, including any borrowings under its revolving credit facility described below, to invest in its core businesses and other new business opportunities related to its core businesses. The Company may use its available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees, as well as purchase larger ownership interests in selected equity method investees, particularly in international markets. Depending on market conditions, Starbucks may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. Management believes that strong cash flow generated from operations, existing cash and investments, as well as borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility, should be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses 33 Table of Contents for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions, share repurchases and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2006 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new Company-operated retail stores and the remodeling and refurbishment of existing Company-operated retail stores, as well as for additional share repurchases, if any. For fiscal 2006, management expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $700 million to $725 million, related to opening approximately 850 Company-operated stores on a global basis, remodeling certain existing stores and enhancing its production capacity and information systems. In August 2005, the Company entered into a $500 million unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “Facility”) with various banks, of which $100 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit. The Facility is scheduled to expire in August 2010 and is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and share repurchases. The Company may request an increase up to an additional $500 million under the credit facility, provided there is no existing default, which would increase total availability to $1 billion. The interest rate for borrowings under the Facility ranges from 0.150% to 0.275% over LIBOR or an alternate base rate, which is the greater of the bank prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%. The specific spread over LIBOR will depend upon the Company’s performance under specified financial criteria. The Facility contains provisions that require the Company to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. As of October 2, 2005, the Company was in compliance with each of these covenants. There were borrowings of $277 million outstanding under the Facility as of October 2, 2005, with a weighted average contractual interest rate of 4.0%. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $924 million in fiscal 2005 and was generated primarily by net earnings of $494 million and noncash depreciation and amortization expenses of $367 million. Cash used by investing activities totaled $221 million in fiscal 2005. Net capital additions to property, plant and equipment used $644 million, primarily from opening 735 new Company-operated retail stores and remodeling certain existing stores. Gross capital additions for fiscal 2005 were $668 million and were offset by impairment provisions and foreign currency translation adjustments totaling $24 million. During fiscal 2005, the Company increased its equity ownership in its licensed operations in Germany, Southern China and Chile and also acquired substantially all of the assets of Ethos Brands, LLC, which together used $22 million, net of cash acquired. Partially offsetting these uses of cash, the net activity in the Company’s portfolio of available-for-sale securities provided $452 million for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2005. Cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2005 totaled $674 million. During fiscal 2005, the Company repurchased 45 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $25.26 per share, using $1.1 billion. Share repurchases, up to the limit authorized by the Board of Directors, are at the discretion of management and depend on market conditions, capital requirements and other factors. The total remaining amount of shares authorized for repurchase as of October 2, 2005 was 22 million. Partially offsetting cash used for share repurchases were borrowings of $277 million under the Facility and $164 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of the Company’s common stock from employee stock purchase plans. As options granted are exercised, the Company will continue to receive proceeds (financing activity) and a tax deduction (operating activity); however, the amounts and the timing cannot be predicted. 34 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and borrowings as of October 2, 2005, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1-3 Years 3-5 Years 5 Years Debt obligations(1) $ 280,618 $ 277,748 $ 1,537 $ 1,127 $ 206 Operating lease obligations(2) 3,097,493 423,564 804,055 690,838 1,179,036 Purchase obligations 384,588 279,076 82,887 20,449 2,176 Total $ 3,762,699 $ 980,388 $ 888,479 $ 712,414 $ 1,181,418 (1) Debt amounts include principal maturities only. The amount due in less than one year includes $277 million of short term borrowings under the Facility. (2) Amounts include the direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. Starbucks expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement The Company has unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen-denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of an unconsolidated equity investee, Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd. (“Starbucks Japan”). The guarantees continue until the loans, including accrued interest and fees, have been paid in full, with the final loan amount due in 2014. The maximum amount is limited to the sum of unpaid principal and interest amounts, as well as other related expenses. These amounts will vary based on fluctuations in the yen foreign exchange rate. As of October 2, 2005, the maximum amount of the guarantees was approximately $9.0 million. Since there has been no modification of these loan guarantees subsequent to the Company’s adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indebtedness of Others,” Starbucks has applied the disclosure provisions only and has not recorded the guarantees on its balance sheet. Product Warranties Coffee brewing and espresso equipment sold to customers through Company-operated and licensed retail stores, as well as equipment sold to the Company’s licensees for use in retail licensing operations, are under warranty for defects in materials and workmanship for a period ranging from 12 to 24 months. The Company establishes an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale, based on historical experience. The following table summarizes the activity related to product warranty reserves during fiscal 2005 and 2004 (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2005 Oct 3, 2004 Balance at beginning of fiscal year $ 3,091 $ 2,227 Provision for warranties issued 7,494 5,093 Warranty claims (8,827 ) (4,229 ) Balance at end of fiscal year $ 1,758 $ 3,091 35 Table of Contents COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS The Company manages its exposure to various risks within the consolidated financial statements according to an umbrella risk management policy, which was approved in May 2005 by the Company’s Board of Directors. Under this policy, market-based risks, including commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates, are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. Additionally, this policy restricts, among other things, the amount of market-based risk the Company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and does not allow for speculative trading activity. The Company purchases significant amounts of coffee and dairy products to support the needs of its Company-operated retail stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the Company’s results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations. For additional details see “Product Supply” in Item 1, as well as “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of the Company’s revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of the Company’s operations consists of activities outside of the United States, the Company has transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Euro and Japanese yen. Under the Company’s umbrella risk management policy, the Company frequently evaluates its foreign currency exchange risk by monitoring market data and external factors that may influence exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, Starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments, with maturities generally not exceeding five years, to hedge assets, liabilities, revenues and purchases denominated in foreign currencies. As of October 2, 2005, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” to hedge a portion of anticipated international revenue and product purchases. In addition, Starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as a hedge of its net investment in Starbucks Japan. These contracts expire within 31 months. Based on the foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of October 2, 2005, a 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract as of October 2, 2005, would result in a reduced fair value of these derivative financial instruments of approximately $11.3 million, of which $4.6 million may reduce the Company’s future earnings. Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in an increase in the fair value of these instruments of approximately $11.3 million, of which $5.8 million may increase the Company’s future earnings. Consistent with the nature of the economic hedges provided by these foreign exchange contracts, increases or decreases in their fair value would be mostly offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the dollar value of the Company’s foreign investment, future foreign currency royalty fee payments and product purchases that would occur within the hedging period. 36 Table of Contents Equity Security Price Risk The Company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds within its trading portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). A corresponding liability is included in “Accrued compensation and related costs” on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in “Interest and other income, net” in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in “General and administrative expenses.” Interest Rate Risk The Company’s available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss).” The Company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its available-for-sale securities. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying interest rate of its interest bearing financial instruments, including its short-term borrowings and long-term debt, as of the end of fiscal 2005, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS The Company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, significant portions of the Company’s net revenues and profits were, and may continue to be realized during the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year, which includes the December holiday season. In addition, quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores, and the Company’s rapid growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences. Because of the seasonality of the Company’s business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results, and require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Starbucks considers its policies on impairment of long-lived assets and accounting for self insurance reserves to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses. For goodwill and other intangible assets, impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the Company’s trademarks. Upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be 37 Table of Contents recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations. Property, plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment. Cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Judgments made by the Company related to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and the ability of the Company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. As the Company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, these factors could cause the Company to realize material impairment charges. Self Insurance Reserves The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance and vehicle liability. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities, portions of which are calculated by third party actuarial firms, could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 115-1, “The Meaning of Other-Than-Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments” (“FSP 115-1”). FSP 115-1 provides accounting guidance for identifying and recognizing other-than-temporary impairments of debt and equity securities, as well as cost method investments in addition to disclosure requirements. FSP 115-1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005, and earlier application is permitted. The Company has adopted this new pronouncement in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of FSP 115-1 did not have an impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The required disclosures are presented in Notes 4 and 7 of this Report. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, “Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143” (“FIN 47”). FIN 47 requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of a legally-required conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred, if the liability’s fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, or no later than Starbucks fiscal fourth quarter of 2006. The Company has not yet determined the impact of adoption on its consolidated statement of earnings and balance sheet. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, “Share-Based Payment” (“SFAS 123R”), a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R will require Starbucks to, among other things, measure all employee stock-based compensation awards using a fair value method and record the expense in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The provisions of SFAS 123R, as amended by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, “Share-Based Payment,” are effective no later than the beginning of the next fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005. Starbucks will adopt the new requirements using the modified prospective transition method in 38 Table of Contents its first fiscal quarter of 2006, which ends January 1, 2006. In addition to the recognition of expense in the financial statements, under SFAS 123R, any excess tax benefits received upon exercise of options will be presented as a financing activity inflow rather than as an adjustment of operating activity as currently presented. Based on its current analysis and information, management has determined that the impact of adopting SFAS 123R will result in a reduction of net earnings and expects diluted earnings per share to be reduced by approximately $0.09 on a full year basis for fiscal 2006. In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 109-1, “Application of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP 109-1”). FSP 109-1 states that qualified domestic production activities should be accounted for as a special deduction under SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” and not be treated as a rate reduction. The provisions of FSP 109-1 are effective immediately. The Company will qualify for a benefit beginning in fiscal 2006, which is not expected to be material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 109-2, “Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004” (“FSP 109-2”). The American Jobs Creation Act allows a special one-time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer (repatriation provision), provided certain criteria are met. The law allows the Company to make an election to repatriate earnings through fiscal 2006. FSP 109-2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. Although FSP 109-2 was effective upon its issuance, it allows companies additional time beyond the enactment date to evaluate the effects of the provision on its plan for investment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the new Act to determine whether it will repatriate foreign earnings and the impact, if any, this pronouncement will have on its consolidated financial statements. As of October 2, 2005, the Company has not made an election to repatriate earnings under this provision. The Company may or may not elect to repatriate earnings in fiscal 2006. Earnings under consideration for repatriation range from $0 to $75 million and the related income tax effects range from $0 to $5 million. As provided in FSP 109-2, Starbucks has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provision. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151, “Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4” (“SFAS 151”). SFAS 151 clarifies that abnormal inventory costs such as costs of idle facilities, excess freight and handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) are required to be recognized as current period charges. The provisions of SFAS 151 are effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 151 in fiscal 2006 is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet or statement of earnings. Item 7A.

The fiscal years ended on October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005, included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended October 3, 2004, included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fiscal fourth quarter. MANAGEMENT OVERVIEW During the fiscal year ended October 1, 2006, the Company’s focus on execution in all areas of its business, from U.S. and International Company-operated retail operations to the Company’s specialty businesses, delivered strong financial performance. Management believes that its ability to achieve the balance between growing the core business and building the foundation for future growth is the key to increasing long-term shareholder value. Starbucks fiscal 2006 performance reflects the Company’s continuing commitment to achieving this balance. The primary driver of the Company’s revenue growth continues to be the opening of new retail stores, both Company-operated and licensed, in pursuit of the Company’s objective to establish Starbucks as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Starbucks opened 2,199 new stores in fiscal 2006 and plans to open approximately 2,400 in fiscal 2007. With a presence in 37 countries, serving customers more than 40 million times per week, management STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K 19 Table of Contents continues to believe that the Company’s long-term goal of approximately 20,000 Starbucks retail locations throughout the United States and at least 20,000 stores in International markets is achievable. In addition to opening new retail stores, Starbucks works to increase revenues generated at new and existing Company-operated stores by attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current customers. The strategy is to increase comparable store sales by continuously improving the level of customer service, introducing innovative products and improving speed with service through training, technology and process improvement. Global comparable store sales for Company-operated markets increased by 7%, making fiscal 2006 the 15th consecutive year with comparable store sales growth of 5% or greater. Comparable store sales growth for fiscal 2007 is expected to be in the range of 3% to 7%. In licensed retail operations, Starbucks shares operating and store development experience to help licensees improve the profitability of existing stores and build new stores. Internationally, the Company’s strategy is to selectively increase its equity stake in licensed international operations as these markets develop. In January 2006, the Company increased its equity ownership from 5% to 100% in its operations in Hawaii and Puerto Rico, and subsequent to the end of fiscal 2006 purchased a 90% stake in its previously-licensed operations in Beijing, China. The combination of more retail stores, comparable store sales growth of 7% and growth in other business channels in the U.S., International, and CPG operating segments resulted in a 22% increase in total net revenues for fiscal 2006, compared to fiscal 2005. The Company expects revenue growth of approximately 20% in fiscal 2007, consistent with its three to five year revenue growth target. Operating income as a percentage of total net revenues decreased to 11.5% in fiscal 2006 from 12.3% in fiscal 2005, due to the recognition of stock-based compensation. Net earnings increased by 14% in fiscal 2006, compared to fiscal 2005. Reported operating margin and net earnings include the effects of stock-based compensation in fiscal 2006, while stock-based compensation expense was not included in the Company’s consolidated financial results in fiscal 2005. ACQUISITIONS In January 2006, Starbucks increased its equity ownership to 100% in its operations in Hawaii and Puerto Rico and applied the consolidation method of accounting from the acquisition date. Previously the Company owned 5% of both Coffee Partners Hawaii and Café del Caribe in Puerto Rico. Because Coffee Partners Hawaii was a general partnership, the equity method of accounting was previously applied. Retroactive application of the equity method of accounting for the Puerto Rico investment, which was previously accounted for under the cost method, resulted in a reduction of retained earnings of $0.5 million as of April 2, 2006. The cumulative effect of the accounting change for financial results previously reported under the cost method and as restated in this report under the equity method reduced net earnings by $97 thousand for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2005 and $93 thousand for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2004. Previously reported earnings per share amounts were not impacted. On October 18, 2006, the Company acquired 90% equity ownership of the licensed operations of 61 Starbucks retail stores in Beijing and Tianjin, China (See Note 20 “Subsequent Event”). 20 STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 The following table presents the consolidated statement of earnings as well as the percentage relationship to total net revenues, unless otherwise indicated, of items included in the Company’s consolidated statements of earnings (amounts in thousands): Oct 1, 2006 % of Oct 2, 2005 % of Oct 3, 2004 % of FISCAL YEAR ENDED (52 Wks) Revenues (52 Wks) Revenues (53 Wks) Revenues STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS DATA Net revenues: Company-operated retail $ 6,583,098 84.5 % $ 5,391,927 84.7 % $ 4,457,378 84.2 % Specialty: Licensing 860,676 11.1 673,015 10.5 565,798 10.7 Foodservice and other 343,168 4.4 304,358 4.8 271,071 5.1 Total specialty 1,203,844 15.5 977,373 15.3 836,869 15.8 Total net revenues 7,786,942 100.0 6,369,300 100.0 5,294,247 100.0 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 3,178,791 40.8 2,605,212 40.9 2,191,440 41.4 Store operating expenses 2,687,815 40.8 (1) 2,165,911 40.2 (1) 1,790,168 40.2 (1) Other operating expenses 260,087 21.6 (2) 197,024 20.2 (2) 171,648 20.5 (2) Depreciation and amortization expenses 387,211 5.0 340,169 5.3 289,182 5.5 General and administrative expenses 473,023 6.1 357,114 5.6 304,293 5.7 Subtotal operating expenses 6,986,927 89.7 5,665,430 88.9 4,746,731 89.7 Income from equity investees 93,937 1.2 76,648 1.2 58,978 1.1 Operating income 893,952 11.5 780,518 12.3 606,494 11.5 Interest and other income, net 12,291 0.1 15,829 0.2 14,140 0.2 Earnings before income taxes 906,243 11.6 796,347 12.5 620,634 11.7 Income taxes 324,770 4.1 301,977 4.7 231,754 4.4 Earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 581,473 7.5 % 494,370 7.8 % 388,880 7.3 % Cumulative effect of accounting change for FIN 47, net of taxes 17,214 0.3 — — — — Net earnings $ 564,259 7.2 % $ 494,370 7.8 % $ 388,880 7.3 % (1) Shown as a percentage of related Company-operated retail revenues.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2006 increased 22% to $7.8 billion from $6.4 billion for fiscal 2005, driven by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. Net revenues are expected to grow approximately 20% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. During the fiscal year ended 2006, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased 22% to $6.6 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $5.4 billion for fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 1,040 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 7% in fiscal 2006. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. Management believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by sustained popularity of core products, new product innovation and a high level of customer satisfaction. STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K 21 Table of Contents The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores, collectively known as “Specialty Operations.” Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 23% to $1.2 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $977 million for fiscal 2005. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements, as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded product operations, increased 28% to $861 million for fiscal 2006, from $673 million for fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,159 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and, to a lesser extent, growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business. Foodservice and other revenues increased 13% to $343 million for fiscal 2006, from $304 million for fiscal 2005. Foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing U.S. foodservice accounts. Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased slightly to 40.8% of total net revenues for fiscal 2006, from 40.9% in fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to fixed rent costs in fiscal 2006 being distributed over an expanded revenue base, as well as increased occupancy costs in fiscal 2005 resulting from intensified store maintenance activities. These favorable items, combined with lower dairy costs, offset higher green coffee costs for fiscal 2006. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased to 40.8% for fiscal 2006 from 40.2% for fiscal 2005. The increase was due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense and to higher provisions for incentive compensation. Other operating expenses, which are expenses associated with the Company’s Specialty Operations, increased to 21.6% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2006, compared to 20.2% in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense as well as higher payroll-related expenditures to support the expanding licensed store operations, both in the U.S. and in existing and new international markets. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $387 million in fiscal 2006, from $340 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $47 million was due to the opening of 1,040 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.0% for fiscal 2006, from 5.3% for fiscal 2005. General and administrative expenses increased to $473 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $357 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was due to higher payroll-related expenditures from the recognition of stock-based compensation expense, additional employees to support continued global growth, and higher professional fees in support of global systems infrastructure development. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.1% for fiscal 2006, from 5.6% for fiscal 2005. Income from equity investees increased to $94 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $77 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to favorable volume-driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready-to-drink beverages which include, among others, bottled Frappuccino® coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot® espresso drinks, as well as improved operating results from international investees, including Korea and Japan, mainly as a result of new store openings. Operating income increased 15% to $894 million in fiscal 2006, from $781 million in fiscal 2005. The operating margin decreased to 11.5% of total net revenues in fiscal 2006, compared to 12.3% in fiscal 2005, due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, decreased to $12 million in fiscal 2006, from $16 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to higher interest expense on the Company’s revolving credit facility, as well as lower interest income earned due to lower average investment balances, offset in part by the recognition of $4.4 million of income on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal 2006. There was no income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal 2005. Income taxes for fiscal 2006 resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.8%, compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2005. The decline in the effective tax rate was due to the reversal of a valuation allowance in fiscal 2006 that had been established in fiscal 2005, 22 STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K Table of Contents the settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 of a multi-year income tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction for which the Company had established a contingent liability, and to increased effectiveness of the Company’s long-term tax planning strategies. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2007 is expected to be approximately 38%, with quarterly variations. OPERATING SEGMENTS Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Company’s management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. Beginning in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006, the Company increased its reporting segments from two to three to include a Global CPG segment in addition to the United States and International segments. This additional operating segment reflects the culmination of internal management realignments in fiscal 2006, and the successful development and launch of certain branded products in the United States and internationally commencing in fiscal 2005 and continuing throughout fiscal 2006. Additionally, with the 100% acquisition of the Company’s operations in Hawaii in fiscal 2006 and the shift in internal management of this market to the United States, these operations have been moved from the International segment into the United States segment. Segment information for all prior periods presented has been revised to reflect these changes.

United States operations sell coffee and other beverages, whole bean coffees, complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and merchandise primarily through Company-operated retail stores. Specialty Operations within the United States include licensed retail stores, foodservice accounts and other initiatives related to the Company’s core business. 24 STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K Table of Contents United States total net revenues increased 21% to $6.2 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $5.1 billion for fiscal 2005. United States Company-operated retail revenues increased 21% to $5.5 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $4.5 billion for fiscal 2005. United States Company-operated retail revenues increased primarily due to the opening of 810 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 7% for fiscal 2006. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in the average value per transaction and a 2% increase in the number of customer transactions. Management believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by new product innovation, continued popularity of core products and a high level of customer satisfaction. Total United States specialty revenues increased 22% to $683 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $558 million in fiscal 2005. United States licensing revenues increased 33% to $369 million, compared to $278 million for fiscal 2005. United States licensing revenues increased due to increased product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 733 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 12% to $314 million from $280 million for fiscal 2005. United States foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. United States operating income increased 17% to $955 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $819 million for the fiscal year ended 2005. Operating margin decreased to 15.5% of related revenues from 16.1% in fiscal 2005. The decrease was due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense. International The Company’s International operations (“International”) represent the remaining 17% of Company-operated retail revenues and 18% of total specialty revenues as well as 17% of total net revenues. International operations sell coffee and other beverages, whole bean coffees, complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through Company-operated retail stores in the United Kingdom, Canada, Thailand, Australia, Germany, China, Singapore, Puerto Rico, Chile and Ireland. Specialty Operations in International primarily include retail store licensing operations in more than 25 countries and foodservice accounts in Canada and the United Kingdom. The Company’s International store base continues to increase rapidly and Starbucks is achieving a growing contribution from established areas of the business while at the same time investing in emerging markets and channels, such as China. The Company’s International operations are in various early stages of development that require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than in the United States. This continuing investment is part of the Company’s long-term, balanced plan for profitable growth. International total net revenues increased 27% to $1.3 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $1.0 billion for fiscal 2005. International Company-operated retail revenues increased 28% to $1.1 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $852 million for fiscal 2005. International Company-operated revenues increased due to the opening of 230 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of 8% for fiscal 2006, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 3% increase in the average value per transaction. Total International specialty revenues increased 26% to $215 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $170 million for fiscal 2005. International licensing revenues increased 28% to $186 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $146 million in fiscal 2005. International licensing revenues increased due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 426 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. International foodservice and other revenues increased 19% to $29 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $24 million in fiscal 2005. International foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in the total number of foodservice accounts. International operating income increased to $108 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $82 million in fiscal 2005. Operating margin increased to 8.3% of related revenues from 8.0% in fiscal 2005, primarily due to lower cost of sales including occupancy costs due to leverage gained from fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base, as STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K 25 Table of Contents well as lower dairy costs. These improvements were partially offset by higher store operating expenses and other operating expenses due to higher payroll-related expenditures primarily to support global expansion as well as the recognition of stock-based compensation expense. Global Consumer Products Group The Company’s CPG segment represents 25% of total specialty revenues and 4% of total net revenues. CPG operations sell a selection of whole bean and ground coffees as well as a selection of premium Tazo® teas through licensing arrangements with Kraft and other grocery and warehouse club stores in United States and international markets. CPG operations also produce and sell ready-to-drink beverages which include, among others, bottled Frappuccino® coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot® espresso drinks, and Starbucks® superpremium ice creams, through its joint venture partnerships, and Starbuckstm Coffee and Cream Liqueurs through a marketing and distribution agreement. Through other manufacturing, distribution and co-packing agreements, the Company produces and sells ready-to-drink products in international locations. CPG total net revenues increased 23% to $305 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $249 million for fiscal 2005, primarily due to volume growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business as well as sales of ready-to-drink coffee beverages introduced in Japan, Taiwan and Korea in the fall of 2005. CPG operating income increased to $167 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $131 million for fiscal 2005. Operating margin increased to 54.6% of related revenues, from 52.7% in fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher income from the Company’s equity investees and lower cost of sales as a percentage of revenues. The increase in equity investee income was primarily due to volume-driven results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready-to-drink beverages which include, among others, bottled Frappuccino® coffee drinks and Starbucks Doubleshot® espresso drinks. Lower cost of sales was due to a sales mix shift to products with higher gross margins. Unallocated Corporate Unallocated corporate expenses pertain to corporate administrative functions that support but are not specifically attributable to the Company’s operating segments, and include related depreciation and amortization expenses. Unallocated corporate expenses increased to $337 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $252 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was due to higher payroll-related expenditures from the recognition of stock-based compensation expense and to additional employees, as well as higher professional fees primarily in support of global systems infrastructure development. Total unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 4.3% for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to 3.9% for fiscal 2005. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2005 increased 20% to $6.4 billion from $5.3 billion for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, driven by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. Net revenues increased 23% when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004. During the fiscal year ended 2005, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased 21% to $5.4 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $4.5 billion for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Company-operated retail revenues increased 23% when calculated on a comparative 52-week basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 746 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 8% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 4% increase in the average value per transaction. Comparable store sales growth percentages were calculated excluding the extra week of fiscal 2004. The increase in the average value per transaction was primarily due to a beverage price increase in October 2004 in the Company’s U.S. and Canadian markets. 26 STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K Table of Contents The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 17% to $977 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $837 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, total specialty revenues increased 19%. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements, as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded-product licensed operations, increased 19% to $673 million for the 52-week period of 2005, from $566 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, total licensing revenues increased 21%, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 926 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 12% to $304 million for the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $271 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, foodservice and other revenues increased 15%, primarily attributable to growth in new and existing U.S. and International foodservice accounts and, to a lesser extent, growth in the Company’s emerging entertainment business. Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased to 40.9% of total net revenues in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from 41.4% in the 53-week period of 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction, offset in part by higher initial costs associated with the continued expansion of a lunch program in Company-operated retail stores. Approximately 3,800 Company-operated stores had the lunch program at the end of fiscal 2005, compared to approximately 2,600 at the end of fiscal 2004. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues were 40.2% for both the 52-week period of fiscal 2005 and the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction in fiscal 2005, offset by higher payroll-related expenditures, as well as higher maintenance and repair expenditures to ensure a consistent Starbucks Experience in existing stores. In order to facilitate ongoing retail store revenue growth, the Company opened a higher number of Drive Thru locations over the past year and extended store operating hours, which contributed to the higher payroll-related expenditures. Other operating expenses, which are expenses associated with the Company’s Specialty Operations, decreased to 20.2% of specialty revenues in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to 20.5% in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenditures within the grocery, warehouse club and foodservice businesses, partially offset by higher payroll-related expenditures to support the Company’s emerging entertainment business and to support the growth of Seattle’s Best Coffee licensed café operations. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $340 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $289 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily from the opening of 746 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.3% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from 5.5% for the corresponding 53-week fiscal 2004 period. General and administrative expenses increased to $357 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to $304 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures in support of both domestic and international business growth and increased charitable donations to support multi-year corporate commitments. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.6% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from 5.7% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004. Income from equity investees increased to $77 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to $59 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to volume-driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready-to-drink beverages which include, among others, bottled Frappuccino® coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot® espresso drinks, and improved operating results from international investees, particularly in Japan and Korea, mainly as a result of new store openings. STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K 27 Table of Contents Operating income increased 29% to $781 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $606 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The operating margin increased to 12.3% of total net revenues in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, compared to 11.5% in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to strong revenue growth. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, increased to $16 million in the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, from $14 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher interest income earned due to higher interest rates in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and to foreign exchange gains in fiscal 2005 compared to losses in fiscal 2004. Partially offsetting these increases were higher realized losses on sales of available-for-sale securities. Starbucks funded the majority of its share repurchases during fiscal 2005 through sales of its available-for-sale securities. Income taxes for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.9%, compared to 37.3% in fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% due to a variety of factors, including state income taxes, the impact from foreign operations, tax credits and other provision adjustments.

STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K 29 Table of Contents United States United States total net revenues increased 20% to $5.1 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $4.3 billion for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States total net revenues increased 22%. United States Company-operated retail revenues increased 19% to $4.5 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $3.8 billion for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States Company-operated retail revenues increased 22%, primarily due to the opening of 580 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 9% for the 52-week period of fiscal 2005. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in the average value per transaction, including 3% attributable to a beverage price increase in October 2004, and a 4% increase in the number of customer transactions. Total United States specialty revenues increased 20% to $558 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $465 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States specialty revenues increased 23%. United States licensing revenues increased 32% to $278 million, compared to $211 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States licensing revenues increased 35%, due to increased product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 596 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 10% to $280 million from $254 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States foodservice and other revenues increased 13%, primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts, as well as growth in the emerging entertainment business. United States operating income increased by 23% to $819 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $664 million for the fiscal year ended 2004. Operating margin increased to 16.1% of related revenues from 15.6% in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to leverage from strong revenue growth. International International total net revenues increased 29% to $1.0 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $794 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, International total net revenues increased 31%. International Company-operated retail revenues increased 30% to $852 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $657 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, International Company-operated revenues increased 32%, primarily due to the opening of 166 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of 6% for the 52-week period of fiscal 2005, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar against both the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a 4% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. Total International specialty revenues increased 24% to $170 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $137 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, International specialty revenues increased 26%.

Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, International licensing revenues increased 24%, due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 330 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. International foodservice and other revenues increased 38% to $24 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $18 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, international foodservice and other revenues increased 41%, primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. International operating income increased to $82 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $47 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Operating margin increased to 8.0% of related revenues from 5.9% in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to leverage gained on most fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base. 30 STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K Table of Contents Global Consumer Products Group CPG total net revenues increased 6% to $249 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $235 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, due to the national rollout of the Starbuckstm Coffee Liqueur during the fiscal second quarter of 2005 and growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business. CPG operating income increased by 26% to $131 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $104 million for the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. Operating margin increased to 52.7% of related revenues from 44.4% in fiscal 2004, primarily due to lower other operating expenses from reduced expenditures within the grocery and warehouse club channels and higher equity investee income from volume-driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready-to-drink beverages which include, among others, bottled Frappuccino® coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot® espresso drinks. Unallocated Corporate Unallocated corporate expenses increased to $252 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $208 million in the 53-week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to increased charitable commitments as well as higher payroll-related expenditures. Total unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues remained unchanged at 3.9% for the fiscal year ended 2005 and the 53-week period of fiscal 2004. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Components of the Company’s most liquid assets are as follows (in thousands): FISCAL YEAR ENDED Oct 1, 2006 Oct 2, 2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 312,606 $ 173,809 Short-term investments — available-for-sale securities 87,542 95,379 Short-term investments — trading securities 53,496 37,848 Long-term investments — available-for-sale securities 5,811 60,475 Total cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments $ 459,455 $ 367,511 The Company manages its cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs and pay down short-term borrowings. The $92 million increase in total cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments from October 2, 2005 to October 1, 2006, was primarily due to strong operating cash flows. The Company intends to use its cash and liquid investments, including any borrowings under its $1 billion revolving credit facility, to invest in its core businesses and other new business opportunities related to its core businesses. The Company may use its available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees, as well as purchase larger ownership interests in selected equity method investees and licensed operations, particularly in international markets. Depending on market conditions, Starbucks may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. Management believes that strong cash flow generated from operations, existing cash and liquid investments, as well as borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility, should be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions, share repurchases and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2007 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new Company-operated retail stores and the remodeling and refurbishment of existing Company-operated retail stores, as well as potential increased investments in International licensees and for additional share repurchases, if any. Management expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $950 million to $1.0 billion in fiscal 2007, primarily driven by new store development and existing store renovations. STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K 31 Table of Contents Cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.1 billion for fiscal 2006. Net earnings provided $564 million and noncash depreciation and amortization expenses further increased cash provided by operating activities by $413 million. In addition, an increase in accrued taxes payable due to the timing of payments provided $133 million. Cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2006 totaled $841 million. Net capital additions to property, plant and equipment used $771 million, primarily from opening 1,040 new Company-operated retail stores and remodeling certain existing stores. During fiscal 2006, the Company used $92 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. In addition, the net activity in the Company’s portfolio of available-for-sale securities provided $61 million. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2006 totaled $155 million. Cash used to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock totaled $854 million. This amount includes the effect of the net change in unsettled trades from October 2, 2005. Share repurchases, up to the limit authorized by the Board of Directors, are at the discretion of management and depend on market conditions, capital requirements and other factors. Approximately 21.5 million shares remained available for repurchase as of October 1, 2006. The Company had net borrowings under its credit facility of $423 million during fiscal 2006, which consisted of additional gross borrowings of $1.4 billion offset by gross principal repayments of $993 million. Management increased the Company’s borrowing capacity under its credit facility during the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006, from $500 million to $1.0 billion, as provided in the original credit facility. As of October 1, 2006, a total of $700 million was outstanding under the facility. Partially offsetting cash used for share repurchases were proceeds of $159 million from the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of the Company’s common stock from employee stock purchase plans. As options granted are exercised, the Company will continue to receive proceeds and a tax deduction; however, the amounts and the timing cannot be predicted. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and borrowings as of October 1, 2006, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in thousands): PAYMENTS DUE BY PERIOD Less than 1 – 3 3 – 5 More than CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Total 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Debt obligations (1) $ 740,480 $ 738,405 $ 1,660 $ 415 $ — Operating lease obligations (2) 3,892,938 531,634 1,013,312 861,271 1,486,721 Purchase obligations (3) 619,862 440,720 153,044 21,761 4,337 Total $ 5,253,280 $ 1,710,759 $ 1,168,016 $ 883,447 $ 1,491,058 (1) Debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments. Rates utilized to determine interest payments for variable rate debt are based on an estimate of future interest rates. The amount due in less than one year includes $700 million of short term borrowings under the facility. (2) Amounts include the direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Purchase obligations relate primarily to green coffee and other commodities. Starbucks expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business, as well as ongoing borrowings under the facility. OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT The Company has unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen-denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of an unconsolidated equity investee, Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd. (“Starbucks Japan”). The guarantees continue until the loans, including accrued interest and fees, have been paid in full, with the final loan amount 32 STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K Table of Contents due in 2014. The maximum amount is limited to the sum of unpaid principal and interest amounts, as well as other related expenses. These amounts will vary based on fluctuations in the yen foreign exchange rate. As of October 1, 2006, the maximum amount of the guarantees was approximately $6.0 million. Since there has been no modification of these loan guarantees subsequent to the Company’s adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indebtedness of Others,” Starbucks has applied the disclosure provisions only and has not recorded the guarantees on its balance sheet. PRODUCT WARRANTIES Coffee brewing and espresso equipment sold to customers through Company-operated and licensed retail stores, as well as equipment sold to the Company’s licensees for use in retail licensing operations, are under warranty for defects in materials and workmanship for a period ranging from 12 to 24 months. Effective fiscal 2006, the Company elected to discontinue repairing brewing machines and instead offer an exchange to customers as a general right of return for any of its products. As a result, Starbucks maintains a sales return allowance based on historical patterns to reduce related revenues for estimated future product returns. Prior to fiscal 2006, the Company established an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale, also based on historical experience. Product warranty costs and changes to the related accrual were not significant for the periods ended October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005. COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS The Company manages its exposure to various risks within the consolidated financial statements according to an umbrella risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks, including commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates, are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. Additionally, this policy restricts, among other things, the amount of market-based risk the Company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity. The Company purchases significant amounts of coffee and dairy products to support the needs of its Company-operated retail stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the Company’s results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations. For additional details see “Product Supply” in Item 1, as well as “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and changes in interest rates. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISK The majority of the Company’s revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of the Company’s operations consists of activities outside of the United States, the Company has transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, euro and Japanese yen. Under the Company’s umbrella risk management policy, the Company frequently evaluates its foreign currency exchange risk by monitoring market data and external factors that may influence exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, Starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments, with maturities generally not exceeding five years, to hedge assets, liabilities, revenues and purchases denominated in foreign currencies. As of October 1, 2006, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” to hedge a portion of anticipated international revenue and product purchases. In addition, Starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as hedges of its net investment in Starbucks Japan, an equity method investment, as well as the Company’s net investments in its Canadian and U.K. subsidiaries. These contracts expire within 33 months. STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K 33 Table of Contents Based on the foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of October 1, 2006, a 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract as of October 1, 2006, would result in a reduced fair value of these derivative financial instruments of approximately $44 million, of which $22 million may reduce the Company’s future earnings. Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in an increase in the fair value of these instruments of approximately $38 million, of which $20 million may increase the Company’s future earnings. Consistent with the nature of the economic hedges provided by these foreign exchange contracts, increases or decreases in their fair value would be mostly offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the dollar value of the Company’s foreign investment, future foreign currency royalty fee payments and product purchases that would occur within the hedging period. EQUITY SECURITY PRICE RISK The Company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds within its trading portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). A corresponding liability is included in “Accrued compensation and related costs” on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in “Interest and other income, net” in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in “General and administrative expenses.” INTEREST RATE RISK The Company’s available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” The Company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its available-for-sale securities. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying interest rate of its interest bearing financial instruments, including its short-term borrowings and long-term debt, as of the end of fiscal 2006, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS The Company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Significant portions of the Company’s net revenues and profits are realized during the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal year, which includes the holiday season. In addition, quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores, and the Company’s rapid growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences. Because of the seasonality of the Company’s business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results, and require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Starbucks considers its policies on impairment of long-lived assets, accounting for self insurance reserves, stock-based compensation and accounting for operating leases to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements. 34 STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K Table of Contents IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses. For goodwill and other intangible assets, impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the Company’s trademarks. Upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations. Property, plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment. Cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Judgments made by the Company related to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and the ability of the Company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. As the Company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, these factors could cause the Company to realize material impairment charges. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION Starbucks accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS 123R. The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them (“expected term”), the estimated volatility of the Company’s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (“forfeitures”). Changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation and consequently, the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of earnings. OPERATING LEASES Starbucks leases retail stores, roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases. The Company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term. Estimating AROs involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs. Future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated. In addition, the large number of operating leases, and the significant number of international markets in which the Company has operating leases, adds administrative complexity to the calculation of ARO expense as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent. SELF INSURANCE RESERVES The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance and vehicle liability. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities, portions of which are calculated by third party actuarial firms, could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48 (“FIN 48”), “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109,” which seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with the accounting STARBUCKS CORPORATION, FORM 10-K 35 Table of Contents and reporting for uncertainty in income tax positions. This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and the Company will adopt the new requirements in its fiscal first quarter of 2008. The cumulative effects, if any, of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company has not yet determined the impact, if any, of adopting FIN 48 on its consolidated financial statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in GAAP, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Starbucks must adopt these new requirements no later than its first fiscal quarter of 2009. Starbucks has not yet determined the effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, if any, upon adoption of SFAS 157, or if it will adopt the requirements prior to the first fiscal quarter of 2009. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB 108”). The intent of SAB 108 is to reduce diversity in practice for the method companies use to quantify financial statement misstatements, including the effect of prior year uncorrected errors. SAB 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors using both an income statement and a cumulative balance sheet approach. SAB 108 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2006, and the Company will adopt the new requirements in fiscal 2008. The adoption of SAB 108 is not currently expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Item 7A.

829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2009,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Starbucks Corporation’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal years ended on September 27, 2009, September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007 all included 52 weeks. Starbucks 2010 fiscal year will include 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in its fourth fiscal quarter. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Overview Fiscal 2009 was a challenging year for Starbucks. The Company was confronted with extraordinary economic and operating challenges in addition to facing an increasingly competitive landscape. Although the global economy has shown some signs of improvement recently, management recognizes the difficult economic situation that many consumers are still facing and does not expect that to significantly change over the course of fiscal 2010. This challenging economic environment has strained consumer discretionary spending in the US and internationally, which in turn has impacted Company revenues, comparable store sales, operating income and operating margins. Starbucks responded to this difficult environment with a more disciplined focus on operations and the introduction of initiatives to permanently improve the Company’s cost structure. The result is an underlying business model that is less reliant on high revenue growth to drive profitability, and that still preserves the fundamental strengths and values of the Starbucks brand. The primary initiatives in this strategy include rationalizing the global Company-operated store portfolio, right-sizing the non-retail support organization, and reducing the Company’s cost structure, while renewing the focus on service excellence in the stores and delivering relevant innovation. Starbucks actions to rationalize its global store portfolio have included the planned closure of nearly 1,000 Company-operated stores globally. At the end of fiscal 2009, nearly all of the approximately 800 US Company-operated stores, 61 stores in Australia and 41 Company-operated stores in other International markets had been closed. The remaining International store closures are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2010. Initiatives targeting reductions in the Company’s cost structure in fiscal 2009 proceeded as planned, with full-year costs of $580 million removed from the Company’s cost structure. These targeted cost reductions and associated operational efficiency efforts, along with a more profitable Company-operated store base, have moved Starbucks toward a more sustainable business model, while preserving the fundamental strengths and values of the brand. The operational efficiency efforts are primarily focused on store level execution and include improved staffing models and better management of waste in coffee, dairy and food. Starbucks actions to improve the customer experience have resulted in a more focused effort toward in-store offerings, and simplifying the demands on store partners (employees), while concurrently raising already-high standards for beverage and food offerings, customer service and the overall in-store experience. The effects of these efforts have already been seen in the Company’s improved customer satisfaction scores. Starbucks has a renewed focus on relevant product innovation and the disciplined expansion and leveraging of its existing products and sales channels. For example, Starbucks VIAtm Ready Brew coffee was launched in fiscal 2009 and is designed to capture a significant share of both the $21 billion global instant coffee category and the single-serve market. The Company intends to drive sales within the retail store base and CPG channels, both in the US and internationally. The Company continues to maintain a solid financial foundation, with no short term debt outstanding at the end of fiscal 2009 and with cash and liquid investments totaling more than $650 million. This solid financial position and continued strong cash flow generation have provided Starbucks with the financial flexibility to implement its restructuring efforts as well as make ongoing investments in its core business. Fiscal 2010 — The View Ahead For fiscal 2010, the Company expects revenues to grow in the low-to-mid single digits compared to fiscal 2009, driven by modestly positive comparable store sales, a 53rd fiscal week, and approximately 100 planned net new 21 Table of Contents stores in the US and approximately 200 net new stores in International markets. Both the US and International net new additions are expected to be primarily licensed stores. Given these revenue expectations, combined with the Company’s reduced cost structure, in-store operating efficiencies, and lower restructuring charges, Starbucks currently expects significant improvement in its consolidated operating margin in fiscal 2010. Operating cash flow for fiscal 2010 is currently expected to reach approximately $1.4 billion and capital expenditures are expected to range from $500 million to $550 million. Operating Segment Overview Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: US, International and CPG. The US foodservice business, which was previously reported in the US segment, is now reported in the CPG segment, as a result of internal management realignments within the US and CPG businesses. Segment information for all prior periods presented has been revised to reflect this change. The US and International segments both include Company-operated retail stores and licensed retail stores. Licensed stores frequently have a higher operating margin than Company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues, but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee. The International segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus Company-operated compared to the US segment; however, the US segment has been operating significantly longer than the International segment and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the more mature US segment has significantly more stores, and higher total revenues than the International segment. Average sales per store are also higher in the US due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels. Further, certain market costs, particularly occupancy costs, are lower in the US segment compared to the average for the International segment, which comprises a more diverse group of operations. As a result of the relative strength of the brand in the US segment, the number of stores, the higher unit volumes, and the lower market costs, the US segment, despite its higher relative percentage of Company-operated stores, has a higher operating margin, excluding restructuring costs, than the less-developed International segment. The Company’s International store base continues to expand and Starbucks has been focusing on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets, such as China, Brazil and Russia. The Company’s newer international markets require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income. The CPG segment includes packaged coffee and tea, and other branded products operations worldwide, and the US foodservice business. For the packaged coffee and tea and branded products, Starbucks operates primarily through licensing arrangements and joint ventures with large consumer products business partners, most significantly with Kraft for distribution of packaged coffees and teas, and The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company for manufacturing and distribution of ready-to-drink beverages. This operating model allows the CPG segment to leverage the business partners’ existing infrastructures and to extend the Starbucks brand in an efficient way. Most of the customer revenues from the packaged coffee and ready-to-drink products are recognized as revenues by the licensed or joint venture business partner, not by the CPG segment. Royalties and payments from our licensing agreements are recorded under licensing revenue, and the proportionate share of the results of the Company’s joint ventures are included, on a net basis, in Income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings. The US foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broadline distribution networks. The CPG segment reflects relatively lower revenues, a modest cost structure, and a resulting higher operating margin, compared to the Company’s other two reporting segments, which consist primarily of retail stores. Expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. These unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses, related depreciation and amortization expenses, corporate restructuring charges and amounts included in Net interest income and other and Interest expense on the consolidated statements of earnings. 22 Table of Contents Acquisitions See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10-K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008 Financial Highlights • Consolidated operating income was $562 million for fiscal 2009 compared to $504 million in fiscal 2008, and operating margin improved to 5.7% compared to 4.9% in fiscal 2008. Cost reduction initiatives and related operational efficiency efforts contributed significantly to the margin improvement, offset in part by higher restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as Starbucks continued its work to rationalize its global store portfolio and support organization. • EPS for fiscal 2009 was $0.52, compared to EPS of $0.43 reported in fiscal 2008. Restructuring charges impacted EPS by approximately $0.28 per share in fiscal 2009 and restructuring and other transformation costs impacted EPS by approximately $0.28 in fiscal 2008. • Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008, while capital expenditures declined to $446 million in fiscal 2009 from $985 million in fiscal 2008. Available operating cash flow during fiscal 2009 was primarily used to reduce short-term borrowings to a zero balance in fiscal 2009, down from $713 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. • The Company realized approximately $580 million in reductions to its cost structure in fiscal 2009, with the initiatives focused on store closures, headcount reductions, in-store efficiencies and supply chain improvements. Consolidated results of operations (in millions): Sep 27, Sep 28, Sep 27, Sep 28, Fiscal Year Ended 2009 2008 % Change 2009 2008 % of Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated retail $ 8,180.1 $ 8,771.9 (6.7 )% 83.7 % 84.5 % Specialty: Licensing 1,222.3 1,171.6 4.3 12.5 11.3 Foodservice and other 372.2 439.5 (15.3 ) 3.8 4.2 Total specialty 1,594.5 1,611.1 (1.0 ) 16.3 15.5 Total net revenues $ 9,774.6 $ 10,383.0 (5.9 )% 100.0 % 100.0 % Company-operated retail revenues decreased from fiscal 2008, primarily attributable to a 6% decline in comparable store sales, comprised of a 4% decline in transactions and a 2% decline in the average value per transaction. Foreign currency translation also contributed to the decline with the effects of a stronger US dollar relative to the British pound and Canadian dollar. The weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the US segment, with a comparable store sales decline of 6% for the year. The International segment experienced a 2% decline in comparable store sales. The Company derived 16% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores, collectively known as specialty operations. The decrease in Foodservice and other revenue was primarily due to the softness in the hospitality industry. 23 Table of Contents Sep 27, Sep 28, % Sep 27, Sep 28, Fiscal Year Ended 2009 2008 Change 2009 2008 % of Total Net Revenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 4,324.9 $ 4,645.3 (6.9 )% 44.2 % 44.7 % Store operating expenses 3,425.1 3,745.1 (8.5 ) 35.0 36.1 Other operating expenses 264.4 330.1 (19.9 ) 2.7 3.2 Depreciation and amortization expenses 534.7 549.3 (2.7 ) 5.5 5.3 General and administrative expenses 453.0 456.0 (0.7 ) 4.6 4.4 Restructuring charges 332.4 266.9 24.5 3.4 2.6 Total operating expenses 9,334.5 9,992.7 (6.6 ) 95.5 96.2 Income from equity investees 121.9 113.6 7.3 1.2 1.1 Operating income $ 562.0 $ 503.9 11.5 % 5.7 % 4.9 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 41.9 % 42.7 % Other operating expenses 16.6 % 20.5 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the implementation of in-store operational efficiencies designed to reduce product waste, and due to lower dairy costs in the US, partially offset by higher coffee costs. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased primarily due to reduced headcount and spending in the regional support organization as a result of Starbucks restructuring efforts, and the effect of initiatives to improve store labor efficiencies. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize the Company’s global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Operating margin expansion was primarily due to the improved labor efficiency and reduced product waste in Company-operated stores, partially offset by increased restructuring charges. Sep 27, Sep 28, % Sep 27, Sep 28, Fiscal Year Ended 2009 2008 Change 2009 2008 % of Total Net Revenues Operating income $ 562.0 $ 503.9 11.5 % 5.7 % 4.9 % Interest income and other, net 36.3 9.0 nm 0.4 0.1 Interest expense (39.1 ) (53.4 ) (26.8 ) (0.4 ) (0.5 ) Earnings before income taxes 559.2 459.5 21.7 5.7 4.4 Income taxes 168.4 144.0 16.9 1.7 1.4 Net earnings $ 390.8 $ 315.5 23.9 % 4.0 % 3.0 % Effective tax rate 30.1 % 31.3 % Net interest income and other increased due primarily to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain balance sheet amounts. Also contributing to the increase were lower unrealized market value losses on the Company’s trading securities portfolio compared to fiscal 2008. As described in more detail in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the trading securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability under its Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). The MDCP liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance, with this offsetting impact recorded in General and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. Interest expense decreased due to a lower average balance of short term 24 Table of Contents borrowings and lower average short term borrowing rates in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. At the end of fiscal 2009, the Company had no short term debt. The relatively low 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized for retroactive tax credits and an income tax credit related to the settlement of an employment tax audit in fiscal 2009. As a result of the audit settlement, approximately $17 million of expense was recorded in Store operating expenses, with an offsetting income tax credit and no impact to net earnings. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35%. Operating Segments Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Company’s management reviews financial information for operational decision making purposes. Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: US, International and CPG. Unallocated Corporate includes expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. Operating income represents earnings before Net interest income and other, Interest expense and Income taxes. The US foodservice business, which was previously reported in the US segment, is now reported in the CPG segment, as a result of internal management realignments within the US and CPG businesses. Segment information for all prior periods presented has been revised to reflect this change. The following tables summarize the Company’s results of operations by segment for fiscal 2009 and 2008 (in millions). United States The US operating segment sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise primarily through Company-operated retail stores. Specialty operations within the US include licensed retail stores and other initiatives related to the Company’s core business.

This improvement was primarily due to operational changes designed to improve labor efficiency and reduce product waste in Company-operated stores, and to lower non-store support costs. Partially offsetting the favorability were higher restructuring charges during the year. The Company incurred higher lease exit and related costs due to the higher number of actual store closures compared to the prior year period. International The International operating segment sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through Company-operated retail stores in Canada, the UK and several other markets. Specialty operations primarily include retail store licensing operations in nearly 40 other countries and foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada and the UK. The Company’s International store base continues to expand and Starbucks expects to achieve a growing contribution from established areas of the business while at the same time investing in emerging markets and channels. Many of the Company’s International operations are in early stages of development that require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than in the US. This continuing investment is part of the Company’s long-term, balanced plan for profitable growth.

Restructuring charges of $27.0 million recognized during the year had a 50 basis point impact on operating margin compared to the prior year, due to the previously announced store closures. Higher store operating expenses as of percentage of Company-operated retail revenues were driven by an increase in store impairment charges and a decline in sales leverage impacting salaries and benefits. Partially offsetting the decrease in operating margin were lower other operating expenses due to headcount reductions in the non-store support functions. Global Consumer Products Group CPG’s licensing revenue is from selling a selection of whole bean and ground coffees and premium Tazo® teas through licensing arrangements in US and international markets, and also producing and selling a variety of ready-to-drink beverages through its joint ventures and marketing and distribution agreements. The foodservice revenue is from the US foodservice business, which sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broadline distribution networks.

During fiscal 2008, Starbucks derived 84% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased, primarily attributable to the opening of 681 new Company-operated retail stores in fiscal 2008, offset by negative 3% comparable store sales for the same period. Revenue growth was slower than in previous years due to a combination of declining comparable store sales and a decrease in the number of net new stores opened during fiscal 2008. The weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the US segment, which posted a comparable store sales decline of 5% for the year. Partially offsetting this was 2% comparable store sales growth in the International segment. Within fiscal 2008, consolidated quarterly revenue growth decelerated each quarter and comparable store sales declined each quarter, reflecting the ongoing challenging economic conditions in the US. The Company derived the remaining 16% of total net revenues from specialty operations. Licensing revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 988 new licensed retail stores in fiscal 2008. The increase in Foodservice and other revenues was primarily driven by growth in new and existing accounts in the foodservice business in the US.

Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased primarily due to higher payroll expenditures as a percentage of revenues coupled with impairment provisions in the US business, primarily driven by the slowdown in projected store openings. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the opening of 681 new Company-operated retail stores in fiscal 2008. General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll-related expenses. Restructuring charges include asset impairment, lease exit and severance costs. These costs are associated with the closure of underperforming stores in the US and Australia, and the rationalization of the Company’s leadership structure and non-store organization. 29 Table of Contents Operating margin compression was primarily due to lower revenues; in addition, restructuring charges accounted for approximately 40% of the decrease.

The trading securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability under its MDCP plan. The MDCP liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance, with this offsetting impact recorded in General and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. Interest expense increased due to the Company’s issuance of $550 million of 10-year 6.25% Senior Notes in August of fiscal 2007. Income taxes for fiscal 2008 resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.3% compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2007. The lower rate was due to the higher proportion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions which have lower tax rates, as well as an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction for manufacturing activities in the US.

Restructuring charges of $210.9 million had a 280 basis point impact on the operating margin. The increase in cost of sales including occupancy costs was primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues. Higher store operating expenses was due to the softer sales, higher payroll-related expenditures, and charges from canceling future store sites and asset impairments.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company’s existing cash and liquid investments were $666.1 million and $322.3 million as of September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, respectively. The Company manages its cash and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs and make scheduled interest and principal payments on its borrowings. Included in the cash and liquid investment balances are the following: • A portfolio of unrestricted trading securities, designed to hedge the Company’s liability under the MDCP. The value of this portfolio was $44.8 million and $49.5 million as of September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by declines in market values of the underlying equity funds. See Note 3 for further details. • Unrestricted cash and liquid securities held within the Company’s wholly owned captive insurance company to fund claim payouts. The value of these unrestricted cash and liquid securities was approximately $11.8 million and $24.0 million as of September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, respectively. 33 Table of Contents As of September 27, 2009, the Company had $92.7 million invested in available-for-sale securities. Included in available-for-sale securities were $55.7 million of auction rate securities (“ARS”), compared with $59.8 million of ARS held as of September 28, 2008, with the decrease due to calls of individual securities. As described in more detail in Note 3, while the ongoing auction failures will limit the liquidity of these investments for some period of time, the Company does not believe the auction failures will materially impact its ability to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures or other business requirements. Credit rating agencies currently rate the Company’s borrowings as follows: Description Standard & Poor’s Moody’s Short-term debt A-2 P-3 Senior unsecured long-term debt BBB Baa3 Outlook Stable Stable On August 28, 2009, Standard and Poor’s Ratings Services revised its outlook on the Company’s credit ratings to stable from negative based on improved credit metrics and stabilizing performance. The rating agency also affirmed the BBB corporate credit rating on the Company and raised the short-term rating to A-2 from A-3 to conform with the stable rating outlook. As a result of the Moody’s P-3 short-term rating issued in May 2009, commercial paper has become less liquid and more expensive than borrowing under the Company’s credit facility. Consequently, the Company utilized its credit facility for almost all short-term borrowing needs subsequent to May 2009. In the latter half of the year the Company reduced its total short-term borrowings to a zero balance due to strong operating cash flows and lower capital spending on new Company-operated stores. Management is unlikely to make significant use of its commercial paper program until its Moody’s short-term ratings improve. Despite limited access to the commercial paper markets, management believes that cash flow from operations and its existing cash and liquid investments, supplemented as needed by the $1 billion in short-term borrowing capacity under the Company’s revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses for the foreseeable future, as well as to fund the cost of lease termination and related costs from the remaining international store closures. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. The Company’s credit facility contains provisions requiring Starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. On June 8, 2009, the credit facility was amended to more accurately reflect the parties’ intent with respect to Amendment No. 4 to the credit facility. Amendment No. 5 to the credit facility did not impact the Company’s borrowing terms, facility size, or covenant ratio, and was completed at minimal cost to the Company. As of September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, the Company was in compliance with each of these covenants. The $550 million of 10-year 6.25% Senior Notes, issued in fiscal 2007, also require Starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants that limit future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, the Company was in compliance with each of these covenants. The Company generated strong operating cash flow during the year ended September 27, 2009 and used its free cash flow to reduce its short-term borrowings from $713.0 million at the end of fiscal 2008 to a zero balance at the end of fiscal 2009 and to increase the balance of its cash and liquid investments. The Company expects to use its cash and liquid investments, including any borrowings under its credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in its core businesses, including new beverage and product innovations, as well as other new business opportunities related to its core businesses. The Company may use its available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees. Any decisions to increase its ownership interest in its equity method investees or licensed operations will be driven by valuation and fit with the Company’s ownership strategy and are likely to be infrequent. Depending on market conditions and within the constraint of maintaining an appropriate capital structure, Starbucks may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. Starbucks 34 Table of Contents did not repurchase any shares in fiscal 2009 under the Company’s share repurchase program; however, the Company will continue to evaluate share repurchases and cash dividends in the future as a use for excess cash generated by the business. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2010 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing Company-operated retail stores; systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure; and new Company-operated retail stores. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 are expected to range from $500 million to $550 million. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion for fiscal 2009 compared to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2008. Cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2009 totaled $421.1 million compared to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2008. The decrease was due to lower capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to opening significantly fewer new Company-operated stores. Cash used by financing activities for the year ended September 27, 2009 totaled $642.2 million, with net repayments of commercial paper and short-term borrowings under the credit facility totaling $713.1 million. As of September 27, 2009, a total of $14.1 million in letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility, leaving $985.9 million of capacity available under the $1 billion combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 27, 2009, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 - 3 3 - 5 More than Contractual Obligations(1) Total Year Years Years 5 Years Debt obligations(2) $ 825.4 $ 34.7 $ 68.8 $ 68.8 $ 653.1 Operating lease obligations(3) 4,389.2 706.7 1,281.3 1,039.1 1,362.1 Purchase obligations(4) 308.3 264.1 34.2 9.5 0.5 Other obligations(5) 109.7 3.3 22.8 6.8 76.8 Total $ 5,632.6 $ 1,008.8 $ 1,407.1 $ 1,124.2 $ 2,092.5 (1) Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as the Company is not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. As of September 27, 2009, the Company had $49.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. (2) Debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments on the long-term debt. (3) Amounts include the direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (4) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Purchase obligations relate primarily to green coffee. (5) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations, capital lease obligations and hedging instruments. Starbucks expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business, as well as ongoing borrowings under the combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements relate to certain guarantees and are detailed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10-K. 35 Table of Contents COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents the Company’s primary market risk, generated by its purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other things. The Company purchases, roasts and sells high-quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, the Company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of its Company-operated retail stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the Company’s results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. The Company manages its exposure to various market-based risks according to an umbrella risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the risk to net earnings. The Company also monitors and limits the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. Additionally, this policy restricts, among other things, the amount of market-based risk the Company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity. In general, hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years. The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. Commodity Price Risk The Company purchases commodity inputs, including coffee, dairy products and diesel that are used in its operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact its financial results. In addition to fixed-price contracts and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, the Company has entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices of its commodity hedges, as of the end of fiscal 2009, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of the Company’s revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in US dollars. However, because a portion of the Company’s operations consists of activities outside of the US, the Company has transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound, euro, and Japanese yen. As a result, Starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues, inventory purchases, assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of September 27, 2009, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases. In addition, Starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of its net investment in Starbucks Japan, as well as the Company’s net investments in its Canada subsidiary, to minimize foreign currency exposure. The Company also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes (free standing derivatives), but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables. Increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the US dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency denominated payables and receivables (i.e. “hedged items”) that would occur within the hedging period. The following table summarizes the potential impact to the Company’s future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the 36 Table of Contents value of the US dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): September 27, 2009 Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 58 (58 ) 13 (13 ) Equity Security Price Risk The Company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within its trading portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability under the MDCP. A corresponding liability is included in Accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in Net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in General and administrative expenses. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of its investments as of the end of fiscal 2009, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Interest Rate Risk The Company utilizes short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt. At the end of fiscal years 2009 and 2008, the Company did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding. The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of the Company’s debt (in millions): September 27, 2009 Change in Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase in 100 Basis Point Decrease in Fair Value Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Debt $ 591.8 (39.8 ) 39.8 The Company’s available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. As of September 27, 2009, the Company’s long-term available-for-sale securities included ARS. Please see Note 3 for further information. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its available-for-sale securities. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of its available-for-sale securities as of the end of fiscal 2009, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results, and require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. 37 Table of Contents Starbucks considers its policies on asset impairment, stock-based compensation, operating leases, self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Asset Impairment When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses. For goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate carrying values exceed estimated fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the Company’s trademarks. Upon determination that the carrying values of such assets are in excess of their estimated fair values, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations. Judgments made by the Company related to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and the ability of the Company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. As the Company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, these factors could cause the Company to realize material impairment charges. Stock-based Compensation Starbucks accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with fair value recognition provisions, under which the Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them (“expected term”), the estimated volatility of the Company’s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. Changes in the subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation; however based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term, management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal 2009 would not have been material. Operating Leases Starbucks leases retail stores, roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases. The Company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term. Estimating AROs involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs. Future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated. In addition, the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which the Company has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of ARO expense, as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate. Self Insurance Reserves The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, and director and officers’ liability insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. 38 Table of Contents Income Taxes Starbucks recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and accrues for uncertain tax positions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. These include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets. Accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments, including estimating the amount, timing and likelihood of ultimate settlement. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.

829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2007,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Starbucks Corporation’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Some fiscal years include 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended on September 30, 2007, October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005, all included 52 weeks. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures. Management Overview Fiscal 2007 — The Year in Review Starbucks achieved solid performance in fiscal 2007 — meeting its targets for store openings, revenue growth, comparable store sales growth, and earnings per share — despite a challenging economic and operating environment, and significant cost increases from dairy. The Company completed the fiscal year with encouraging trends and momentum in its International business but faced increasing challenges in its U.S. business. While U.S. comparable store sales were within the Company’s stated target range, it was accomplished through two price increases which offset flat-to-negative transaction count trends in the U.S. business. The pressure on traffic is consistent with similar trends reported across both the retail and restaurant industry. Management believes that the combination of the economic slowdown and the price increases implemented in fiscal 2007 to help mitigate significant cost pressures have impacted the frequency of customer visits to Starbucks stores. Consolidated net revenues for fiscal year 2007 increased 21% to $9.4 billion. Company-operated retail revenues in fiscal 2007 rose 21% to $8.0 billion, predominantly due to the opening of 1,342 stores and comparable store sales growth of 5%. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the average value per transaction and 1% growth in the number of customer transactions. The Company opened a total of 2,571 new company-operated and licensed stores during the year, with 70% in the U.S. and 30% in International markets, to end the year with over 15,000 stores. For fiscal 2007, operating income increased to $1.1 billion, while operating margin contracted 30 basis points to 11.2% of total net revenues. Margin compression was due to higher costs of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a shift in sales to higher cost products and higher distribution costs, rent expense and dairy costs. These cost pressures were offset in part by leveraging general and administrative expenses, store operating expenses, and other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. Net earnings rose to $673 million in fiscal 2007 from $564 million for the previous year. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2007 increased to $0.87 compared to $0.71 a year ago. Excluding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006, earnings grew 16% and diluted earnings per share increased 19%. Fiscal 2008 — The View Ahead Throughout fiscal 2007, Starbucks experienced a consistent weakening in its U.S. business, exiting the year with a negative trend in transactions. Management recognizes that it faces a more challenging environment from an economic, operational and competitive standpoint entering fiscal 2008. In response to those challenges, management intends to focus in the following key areas: • Better operational excellence at the store level; • More meaningful innovation to continue to differentiate the store experience; and • Increased efficiencies and effectiveness in the general and administrative infrastructure, to become more capable of navigating through the fluctuations in the external environment. 20 Table of Contents In setting targets for fiscal 2008, management’s goal was to balance the long-term opportunity for store growth with the near-term realities of the challenging economic and operating environment. For fiscal 2008 the Company is targeting: • Opening approximately 2,500 new stores; • Comparable store sales growth in the range of 3% to 5%; • Total net revenue growth in the range of approximately 17% to 18%, to over $11 billion; and • Earnings per share in the range of $1.02 to $1.05, representing 17% to 21% growth, with earnings per share expansion expected to be greater in the second half of fiscal 2008. In summary, management believes these targets are balanced for fiscal 2008. The Company intends to continue to build out stores to take advantage of its global opportunity, to better execute in its U.S. business, to grow and deliver significant margin expansion in its International business, and to deliver margin improvement for the Company on a consolidated basis. Operating Segment Overview Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: United States, International and CPG. The United States and International segments both include Company-operated retail stores, licensed retail stores and foodservice operations. The United States segment has been operating significantly longer than the International segment and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the United States segment has significantly more stores, and higher total revenues than the International segment. Average sales per store are also higher in the United States due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels. Further, certain market costs, particularly occupancy costs, are lower in the United States segment compared to the average for the International segment, which comprises a more diverse group of operations. As a result of the relative strength of the brand in the United States segment, the number of stores, the higher unit volumes, and the lower market costs, the United States segment has a higher operating margin than the less-developed International segment. The Company’s International store base continues to increase rapidly and Starbucks is achieving a growing contribution from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets, such as China, Brazil and Russia. The Company’s newer international markets require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income. The CPG segment includes the Company’s grocery and warehouse club business as well as branded products operations worldwide. The CPG segment operates primarily through joint ventures and licensing arrangements with large consumer products business partners, most significantly The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company for distribution of ready-to-drink beverages, and with Kraft Foods Inc. for distribution of packaged coffees and teas. This operating model allows the CPG segment to leverage the business partners’ existing infrastructures and to extend the Starbucks brand in an efficient way. Most of the customer revenues from the ready-to-drink and packaged coffee channels are recognized as revenues by the joint venture or licensed business partner, not by the CPG segment, and the proportionate share of the results of the Company’s joint ventures are included on a net basis in “Income from equity investees” on the consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, the CPG segment reflects relatively lower revenues, a modest cost structure, and a resulting higher operating margin, compared to the Company’s other two reporting segments, which consist primarily of retail stores. Expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. These unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses, related depreciation and amortization expenses and amounts included in “Net interest and other income” on the consolidated statements of earnings. 21 Table of Contents Acquisitions In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company purchased a 90% stake in its previously-licensed operations in Beijing, China. Due to its majority ownership of these operations, Starbucks applied the consolidation method of accounting subsequent to the date of acquisition.

(2) As a percentage of related total specialty revenues, other operating expenses were 20.8%, 21.1% and 19.7% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005, respectively. 22 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, increased 21% to $9.4 billion from $7.8 billion for fiscal 2006, driven by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. During the fiscal year ended 2007, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased 21% to $8.0 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, from $6.6 billion for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 1,342 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 5% for the fiscal year ended 2007. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the average value per transaction and a 1% increase in the number of customer transactions. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores, collectively known as specialty operations. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 17% to $1.4 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, from $1.2 billion for fiscal 2006. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded-product operations, increased 19% to $1.0 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, from $861 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,229 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and a 20% increase in licensing revenues from the Company’s CPG business. Foodservice and other revenues increased 13% to $387 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, from $343 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in new and existing accounts in the U.S. foodservice business. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased to 42.5% of total net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to 40.8% for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to a shift in sales mix to higher cost products, the rise in distribution costs, higher rent expense and higher dairy costs. Dairy expense for the U.S. segment represents approximately 75% of the total Company’s dairy expense. For the U.S. segment the average dairy costs per gallon rose 10% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, resulting in approximately $20 million of additional expense. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased to 40.2% for the fiscal year ended 2007, from 40.8% for fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year due to exceptionally strong performance as well as leverage on regional overhead costs in fiscal 2007. Other operating expenses (expenses associated with the Company’s Specialty Operations) decreased to 20.8% of total specialty revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to 21.1% in fiscal 2006. The decline resulted primarily from controlled discretionary spending in fiscal 2007. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $467 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $387 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 1,342 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to 4.9% for the fiscal 2007, compared to 5.0% for fiscal 2006. General and administrative expenses increased to $489 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $479 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures in support of continued global growth, offset in part by unusually high charitable contributions in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.2% for the fiscal year ended 2007, from 6.1% for fiscal 2006. Income from equity investees increased 15% to $108 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $94 million for fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher equity income from international investees. Operating income increased 18% to $1.1 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $894 million for fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 11.2% of total net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, from 11.5% for fiscal 2006. Margin compression was due to higher costs of sales and occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a shift in sales to higher cost products and higher distribution costs, rent expense and dairy costs. 23 Table of Contents These cost pressures were offset in part by leveraging general and administrative expenses, store operating expenses, and other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. Net interest and other income was $2 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $12 million for fiscal 2006. The decrease was primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from a higher level of borrowings outstanding, which include the $550 million of senior notes issued in August 2007, offset in part by a higher amount of income recognized on unredeemed stored value card and gift certificate balances in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2007 resulted in an effective tax rate of 36.3%, compared to 35.8% for fiscal 2006. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is expected to be approximately in line with fiscal 2007, with quarterly variations. Net earnings for the fiscal year ended 2007, increased 19% to $673 million from $564 million for fiscal 2006. Diluted earnings per share increased to $0.87 for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $0.71 per share for fiscal 2006. Excluding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in fourth quarter 2006, earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle grew 16% and diluted earnings per share increased 19%. Operating Segments Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Company’s management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: United States, International and CPG. “Unallocated Corporate” includes expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. Operating income represents earnings before “Net interest and other income” and “Income taxes.” The following tables summarize the Company’s results of operations by segment for fiscal 2007 and 2006 (in thousands): United States 52 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended Sept 30, Oct 1, % Sept 30, Oct 1, 2007 2006 Change 2007 2006 As a % of U.S. total net revenues Net revenues: Company-operated retail $ 6,560,864 $ 5,495,240 19.4 % 89.3 % 88.9 % Specialty: Licensing 439,161 369,155 19.0 6.0 6.0 Foodservice and other 348,968 314,162 11.1 4.7 5.1 Total specialty 788,129 683,317 15.3 10.7 11.1 Total net revenues 7,348,993 6,178,557 18.9 100.0 100.0 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 2,956,231 2,374,485 24.5 40.2 38.4 Store operating expenses(1) 2,684,196 2,280,044 17.7 36.5 36.9 Other operating expenses(2) 204,672 190,624 7.4 2.8 3.1 Depreciation and amortization expenses 348,199 284,625 22.3 4.7 4.6 General and administrative expenses 85,948 93,754 (8.3 ) 1.2 1.5 Total operating expenses 6,279,246 5,223,532 20.2 85.4 84.5 Income from equity investees 768 151 nm — — Operating income $ 1,070,515 $ 955,176 12.1 % 14.6 % 15.5 % (1) As a percentage of related Company-operated retail revenues, store operating expenses were 40.9% and 41.5% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, respectively. 24 Table of Contents (2) As a percentage of related total specialty revenues, other operating expenses were 26.0% and 27.9% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, respectively. The United States operating segment (“United States”) sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise primarily through Company-operated retail stores. Specialty operations within the United States include licensed retail stores, foodservice accounts and other initiatives related to the Company’s core business. United States total net revenues increased 19% to $7.3 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $6.2 billion for fiscal 2006. United States Company-operated retail revenues increased 19% to $6.6 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $5.5 billion for fiscal 2006, primarily due to the opening of 1,065 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 4% for fiscal 2007, nearly all resulting from an increase in the average value per transaction. The U.S. Company-operated retail business experienced deteriorating trends in transactions late in the year, driven by, management believes, the U.S. economic slowdown combined with two price increases in U.S. retail stores implemented in fiscal 2007. Management believes that several initiatives underway in the U.S. business, namely an enhanced focus on operational excellence in the stores, a more robust marketing strategy, meaningful product innovation and a renewed focus on the core beverage and coffeehouse experience, will help address those challenges in the U.S. retail business. In addition, in fiscal 2008 the Company plans to slightly reduce the pace of new store openings in the U.S. from the previous year in order to ensure the selection of store location and store format are the best fit for its customers and the business. Total United States specialty revenues increased 15% to $788 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $683 million in fiscal 2006. United States licensing revenues increased 19% to $439 million, compared to $369 million for fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 723 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. United States foodservice and other revenues increased 11% to $349 million, from $314 million in fiscal 2006, primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. United States operating income increased 12% to $1.1 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $955 million for fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 14.6% of related revenues from 15.5% in fiscal 2006. The decrease was due to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs, primarily due to a shift in sales mix to higher cost products such as food and merchandise, higher distribution costs, higher rent expense and higher dairy costs. Partially offsetting these were lower store operating expenses, lower general and administrative expenses, and lower other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. The decline in store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year as well as leverage on regional overhead costs in fiscal 2007. General and administrative expenses were lower primarily due to decreased salary and related benefits expense as well as lower professional fees. The decline in other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to controlled discretionary spending in the current year. 25 Table of Contents International 52 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended Sept 30, Oct 1, % Sept 30, Oct 1, 2007 2006 Change 2007 2006 As a % of international total net revenues Net revenues: Company-operated retail $ 1,437,401 $ 1,087,858 32.1 % 84.7 % 83.5 % Specialty: Licensing 220,832 186,050 18.7 13.0 14.3 Foodservice and other 37,926 29,006 30.8 2.3 2.2 Total specialty 258,758 215,056 20.3 15.3 16.5 Total net revenues 1,696,159 1,302,914 30.2 100.0 100.0 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 824,594 625,008 31.9 48.6 48.0 Store operating expenses(1) 531,693 407,771 30.4 31.4 31.3 Other operating expenses(2) 69,881 50,900 37.3 4.1 3.9 Depreciation and amortization expenses 84,165 66,800 26.0 5.0 5.1 General and administrative expenses 93,806 78,337 19.7 5.5 6.0 Total operating expenses 1,604,139 1,228,816 30.5 94.6 94.3 Income from equity investees 45,723 34,370 33.0 2.7 2.6 Operating income $ 137,743 $ 108,468 27.0 % 8.1 % 8.3 % (1) As a percentage of related Company-operated retail revenues, store operating expenses were 37.0% and 37.5% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, respectively.

The International operating segment (“International”) sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through Company-operated retail stores in Canada, the UK and eight other markets. Specialty operations in International primarily include retail store licensing operations in more than 30 other countries and foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada and the UK. The Company’s International store base continues to increase rapidly and Starbucks is achieving a growing contribution from established areas of the business while at the same time investing in emerging markets and channels. Many of the Company’s International operations are in early stages of development that require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than in the United States. This continuing investment is part of the Company’s long-term, balanced plan for profitable growth. International total net revenues increased 30% to $1.7 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2006. International Company-operated retail revenues increased 32% to $1.4 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 277 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of 7% for fiscal 2007 and favorable foreign currency exchange for the British pound sterling. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions coupled with a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. Total International specialty revenues increased 20% to $259 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $215 million in fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 506 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. 26 Table of Contents International operating income increased 27% to $138 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $108 million in fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 8.1% of related revenues from 8.3% in fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs due in part to a shift in sales mix to higher cost products such as food and merchandise and higher distribution costs. Partially offsetting this increase was lower general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues.

CPG total net revenues increased 20% to $366 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $305 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to increased sales of U.S. packaged coffee and tea as well as increased product sales and royalties in the international ready-to-drink business. CPG operating income increased by 10% to $184 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $167 million in fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 50.1% of related revenues, from 54.6% in fiscal 2006. Contraction of operating margin was primarily due to slower growth in income from the North American Coffee Partnership, an equity investee, which produces ready-to-drink beverages.

Unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased to 3.6% for the fiscal year ended 2007, from 4.3% for fiscal 2006, primarily as a result of leveraging of the Company’s scale and infrastructure against global growth. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 Consolidated Results of Operations Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2006 increased 22% to $7.8 billion from $6.4 billion for fiscal 2005, driven by increases in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. During the fiscal year ended 2006, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased 22% to $6.6 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $5.4 billion for fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 1,043 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 7% in fiscal 2006. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 23% to $1.2 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $977 million for fiscal 2005. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements, as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded product operations, increased 28% to $861 million for fiscal 2006, from $673 million for fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,156 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and, to a lesser extent, growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business. Foodservice and other revenues increased 13% to $343 million for fiscal 2006, from $304 million for fiscal 2005. Foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing U.S. foodservice accounts. Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased slightly to 40.8% of total net revenues for fiscal 2006, from 40.9% in fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to fixed rent costs in fiscal 2006 being distributed over an expanded revenue base, as well as increased occupancy costs in fiscal 2005 resulting from intensified store maintenance activities. These favorable items, combined with lower dairy costs, offset higher green coffee costs for fiscal 2006. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased to 40.8% for fiscal 2006 from 40.2% for fiscal 2005. The increase was due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense and to higher provisions for incentive compensation. The Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of new accounting requirements to expense stock-based compensation at the beginning of its fiscal first quarter of 2006. Under the transition provisions allowed, it adopted the new requirements on a prospective basis and the financial statements for fiscal 2005 and prior years do not include stock-based compensation expense. Other operating expenses, which are expenses associated with the Company’s Specialty Operations, increased to 21.1% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2006, compared to 19.7% in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense as well as higher payroll-related expenditures to support the expanding licensed store operations, both in the U.S. and in existing and new international markets. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $387 million in fiscal 2006, from $340 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $47 million was due to the opening of 1,043 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.0% for fiscal 2006, from 5.3% for fiscal 2005. General and administrative expenses increased to $479 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $362 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was due to higher payroll-related expenditures from the recognition of stock-based compensation expense, additional employees to support continued global growth, and higher professional fees in support of global systems infrastructure development. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.1% for fiscal 2006, from 5.7% for fiscal 2005. 28 Table of Contents Income from equity investees increased to $94 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $77 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to favorable volume-driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready-to-drink beverages which include, among others, bottled Frappuccino® coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot® espresso drinks, as well as improved operating results from international investees, including Korea and Japan, mainly as a result of new store openings. Operating income increased 15% to $894 million in fiscal 2006, from $781 million in fiscal 2005. The operating margin decreased to 11.5% of total net revenues in fiscal 2006, compared to 12.3% in fiscal 2005, due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, decreased to $12 million in fiscal 2006, from $16 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to higher interest expense on the Company’s revolving credit facility, as well as lower interest income earned due to lower average investment balances, offset in part by the recognition of $4.4 million of income on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal 2006. There was no income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal 2005. Income taxes for fiscal 2006 resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.8%, compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2005. The decline in the effective tax rate was due to the reversal of a valuation allowance in fiscal 2006 that had been established in fiscal 2005, the settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 of a multi-year income tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction for which the Company had established a contingent liability, and to increased effectiveness of the Company’s long-term tax planning strategies.

United States Company-operated retail revenues increased 21% to $5.5 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $4.5 billion for fiscal 2005. United States Company-operated retail revenues increased primarily due to the opening of 810 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 7% for fiscal 2006. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. Total United States specialty revenues increased 22% to $683 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $558 million in fiscal 2005. United States licensing revenues increased 33% to $369 million, compared to $278 million for fiscal 2005. United States licensing revenues increased due to increased product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 733 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 12% to $314 million from $280 million for fiscal 2005. United States foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. United States operating income increased 17% to $955 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $819 million for the fiscal year ended 2005. Operating margin decreased to 15.5% of related revenues from 16.1% in fiscal 2005. The decrease was due to the recognition of stock-based compensation expense.

International Company-operated retail revenues increased 28% to $1.1 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $852 million for fiscal 2005. International Company-operated revenues increased due to the opening of 233 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of 8% for fiscal 2006, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 3% increase in the average value per transaction. Total International specialty revenues increased 26% to $215 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $170 million for fiscal 2005. International licensing revenues increased 28% to $186 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $146 million in fiscal 2005. International licensing revenues increased due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 423 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. International foodservice and other revenues increased 19% to $29 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $24 million in fiscal 2005. International foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in the total number of foodservice accounts. International operating income increased to $108 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $82 million in fiscal 2005. Operating margin increased to 8.3% of related revenues from 8.0% in fiscal 2005, primarily due to lower cost of sales including occupancy costs due to leverage gained from fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base, as well as lower dairy costs. These improvements were partially offset by higher store operating expenses and other operating expenses due to higher payroll-related expenditures primarily to support global expansion as well as the recognition of stock-based compensation expense.

CPG operating income increased to $167 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $131 million for fiscal 2005. Operating margin increased to 54.6% of related revenues, from 52.7% in fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher income from the Company’s equity investees and lower cost of sales as a percentage of revenues. The increase in equity investee income was primarily due to volume-driven results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready-to-drink beverages which include, among others, bottled Frappuccino® beverages and 31 Table of Contents Starbucks DoubleShot® espresso drinks. Lower cost of sales was due to a sales mix shift to products with higher gross margins.

Total unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 4.3% for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to 3.9% for fiscal 2005. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary sources of the Company’s liquidity are cash flows generated from retail store operations and other business channels, borrowings under available commercial paper programs and credit agreements, proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt securities and the Company’s existing cash and liquid investments, which were $460 million and $459 million as of September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, respectively. Components of the Company’s most liquid assets are as follows (in thousands): Sept 30, Oct 1, Fiscal Year Ended 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 281,261 $ 312,606 Short-term investments — available-for-sale securities 83,845 87,542 Short-term investments — trading securities 73,588 53,496 Long-term investments — available-for-sale securities 21,022 5,811 Total cash and liquid investments $ 459,716 $ 459,455 In order to hedge its liability under its Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”), the Company maintains a portfolio of unrestricted trading securities, the value of which was $74 million as of September 30, 2007. In addition, unrestricted cash and liquid securities held within the Company’s wholly owned captive insurance company to fund claim payouts totaled approximately $98 million as of September 30, 2007. The Company manages the balance of its cash and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs and make scheduled payments on short-term borrowings. In determining the appropriate capital structure for the Company, management considers, among other things, how debt may reduce its total cost of capital when used to fund increased distributions to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases. The Company also evaluates its degree of cash flow risk and how much financial flexibility should be retained for future investment opportunities given its high growth rate. The Company’s key metrics for monitoring its capital structure are leverage, measured as the ratio of debt to EBITDA, and coverage, measured as the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense including rent expense. Both ratios are adjusted to capitalize operating leases. The credit rating agencies, Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s, currently rate the Company’s commercial paper P-2 and A-2, respectively, and its long-term debt Baa1 and BBB+, respectively. The Company intends to use its cash and liquid investments, including any borrowings under its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and proceeds from the issuance of long term debt securities, to invest in its core businesses and other new business opportunities related to its core businesses. The Company may use its available 32 Table of Contents cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees, as well as purchase larger ownership interests in selected equity method investees and licensed operations, particularly in international markets. Depending on market conditions, Starbucks may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. Management believes that strong cash flow generated from operations, existing cash and liquid investments, as well as borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, should be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions, share repurchases and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2008 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new Company-operated retail stores and the remodeling and refurbishment of existing Company-operated retail stores, as well as potential increased investments in International licensees and for additional share repurchases, if any. Management expects capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 to be consistent with the $1.1 billion invested in fiscal 2007, primarily driven by new store development and existing store renovations. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.3 billion for fiscal 2007. Of this amount, net earnings provided $673 million and noncash depreciation and amortization expenses further increased cash provided by operating activities by $491 million. In addition, an increase in accrued taxes payable due to the timing of payments provided $86 million. Cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2007 totaled $1.2 billion. Net capital additions to property, plant and equipment used $1.1 billion, primarily from opening 1,342 new Company-operated retail stores and remodeling certain existing stores. During fiscal 2007, the Company used $53 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. In addition, the net activity in the Company’s portfolio of available-for-sale securities used $12 million. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2007 totaled $172 million. Cash used to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock totaled $997 million. This amount includes the effect of the net change in unsettled trades from October 1, 2006. Share repurchases, up to the limit authorized by the Board of Directors, are at the discretion of management and depend on market conditions, capital requirements and other factors. As of September 30, 2007, a total of up to 13.5 million shares remained available for repurchase, under existing authorizations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company issued $550 million of 6.25% Senior Notes due in August 2017, in an underwritten registered public offering. The proceeds of $549 million, before expenses, were primarily used to repay short-term borrowings and fund additional share repurchases. Net new borrowings under the Company’s credit facility and commercial paper program were $10 million for fiscal 2007. As of September 30, 2007, a total of $710 million in borrowings were outstanding under the commercial paper program and $13 million in letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility, leaving $275 million of capacity available under the $1 billion combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. Partially offsetting cash used for share repurchases were proceeds of $177 million from the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of the Company’s common stock from employee stock purchase plans. As options granted are exercised, the Company will continue to receive proceeds and a tax deduction; however, the amounts and the timing cannot be predicted. 33 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 30, 2007, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 1 - 3 3 - 5 More Than 5 Contractual Obligations Total Year Years Years Years Debt obligations(1) $ 1,607,845 $ 747,268 $ 69,896 $ 68,806 $ 721,875 Operating lease obligations(2) 5,016,583 691,011 1,300,776 1,109,193 1,915,603 Purchase obligations(3) 427,306 267,743 141,611 13,426 4,526 Other obligations(4) 57,594 1,181 17,159 4,741 34,513 Total $ 7,109,328 $ 1,707,203 $ 1,529,442 $ 1,196,166 $ 2,676,517 (1) Debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments on commercial paper and long-term debt. (2) Amounts include the direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Purchase obligations relate primarily to green coffee and other commodities. (4) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations, hedging instruments and capital lease obligations. Starbucks expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business, as well as ongoing borrowings under the commercial paper program. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement The Company has unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen-denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of an unconsolidated equity investee, Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd. (“Starbucks Japan”). The guarantees continue until the loans, including accrued interest and fees, have been paid in full, with the final loan amount due in 2014. The maximum amount is limited to the sum of unpaid principal and interest amounts, as well as other related expenses. These amounts will vary based on fluctuations in the yen foreign exchange rate. As of September 30, 2007, the maximum amount of the guarantees was approximately $4.9 million. Since there has been no modification of these loan guarantees subsequent to the Company’s adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Interpretation No. 45, “Guarantor’s Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others,” Starbucks has applied the disclosure provisions only and has not recorded the guarantees on its consolidated balance sheet. COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents the Company’s primary market risk, generated by its purchases of green coffee and dairy products. The Company purchases, roasts and sells high quality whole bean coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, the Company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of its Company-operated retail stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the Company’s results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations. For additional details see “Product Supply” in Item 1, as well as “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices, and interest rates. The Company manages its exposure to various market-based risks according to an umbrella risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The umbrella risk management policy governs the 34 Table of Contents hedging instruments the business may use and limits the dollar risk to net earnings. The Company also monitors and limits the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. Additionally, this policy restricts, among other things, the amount of market-based risk the Company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity. In general, hedge instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years. The sensitivity analyses performed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. Commodity Price Risk The Company purchases commodity inputs, including coffee and dairy products that are used in its operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact its financial results. In addition to fixed-priced contracts and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, the Company may enter into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices of its commodity hedges, as of the end of fiscal 2007, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of the Company’s revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of the Company’s operations consists of activities outside of the United States, the Company has transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, euro, and Japanese yen. As a result, Starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues, inventory purchases, assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of September 30, 2007, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (“SFAS”) No. 133, “Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities,” as amended and interpreted, to hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases. In addition, Starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of its net investment in Starbucks Japan, as well as the Company’s net investments in its Canadian, UK, and Chinese subsidiaries, to minimize foreign currency exposure. These contracts expire within 30 months. The Company also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes (free standing derivatives), but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables. Increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the U.S. dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency denominated payables and receivables (i.e. “hedged items”) that would occur within the hedging period. The following table summarizes the potential impact to the Company’s future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): September 30, 2007 Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 38 (34 ) 18 (22 ) Equity Security Price Risk The Company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds within its trading portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability under the MDCP. A corresponding liability is included in “Accrued compensation and related costs” on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are 35 Table of Contents recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in “Net interest and other income” in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in “General and administrative expenses.” The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of its investments, as of the end of fiscal 2007, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Interest Rate Risk The Company utilizes short and long term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt. At the end of fiscal years 2007 and 2006, the Company did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2007, the Company had Treasury interest rate contracts in place to mitigate a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the $550 million Senior Notes issued in August 2007. These contracts were dedesignated and settled at closing of the debt offering. The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of the Company’s debt (in millions): September 30, 2007 Change in Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase in 100 Basis Point Decrease in Fair Value Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Debt $ 1,269 (41 ) 41 The Company’s available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” The Company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its available-for-sale securities. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of its available-for-sale securities, as of the end of fiscal 2007, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS The Company’s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season. The Company’s cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the fiscal first quarter than the remainder of the year. This is largely driven by cash received as Starbucks Cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season. Since revenues from the Starbucks Card are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased, seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced. Quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores, and the Company’s growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences. For these reasons, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results, and require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Starbucks considers its policies on impairment of long-lived assets, stock-based compensation, operating leases, self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements. 36 Table of Contents Impairment of Long-Lived Assets When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses. For goodwill and other intangible assets, impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the Company’s trademarks. Upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations. Property, plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment. Cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Judgments made by the Company related to the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and the ability of the Company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. As the Company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, these factors could cause the Company to realize material impairment charges. Stock-based Compensation Starbucks accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them (“expected term”), the estimated volatility of the Company’s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (“forfeitures”). Changes in the subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation; however based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term, management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal 2007 would not have been material. Operating Leases Starbucks leases retail stores, roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases. The Company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term. Estimating AROs involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs. Future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated. In addition, the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which the Company has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of ARO expense, as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent. Self Insurance Reserves The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance and vehicle liability. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes Starbucks accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement 37 Table of Contents carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. These include establishing a valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets, and contingent tax liabilities provided for the possibility of unfavorable outcomes in certain tax positions. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”), which seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with the accounting and reporting for uncertainty in income tax positions. This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and the Company will adopt the new requirements in its first fiscal quarter of 2008. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company expects that the effect of adopting FIN 48 will result in an immaterial adjustment to fiscal year 2008 opening retained earnings. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, “Fair Value Measurements” (“SFAS 157”), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Starbucks must adopt these new requirements no later than its first fiscal quarter of 2009. Starbucks has not yet determined the effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, if any, upon adoption of SFAS 157, or if it will adopt the requirements prior to the first fiscal quarter of 2009. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, “Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements” (“SAB 108”). The intent of SAB 108 is to reduce diversity in practice for the method companies use to quantify financial statement misstatements, including the effect of prior year uncorrected errors. SAB 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors using both an income statement and cumulative balance sheet approach. SAB 108 was effective for annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006, and the Company adopted the new requirements in fiscal 2007 with no impact to its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, “The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities” (“SFAS 159”). SFAS 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, or Starbucks first fiscal quarter of 2009. Early adoption is permitted. Starbucks has not yet determined if it will elect to apply any of the provisions of SFAS 159 or what the effect of adoption of the statement would have, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.

829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2008,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Starbucks Corporation’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Some fiscal years include 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended on September 28, 2008, September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006 all included 52 weeks. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Management Overview Fiscal 2008 — The Year in Review Throughout fiscal 2008, Starbucks continued to experience declining comparable store sales in its US stores, primarily due to lower customer traffic. With the US segment representing 76% of consolidated revenues, the impact of this decline on the Company’s financial results for fiscal 2008 was significant. For fiscal year 2008 comparable store sales declined 5% in the US, with a declining trend over the course of the year, ending with a decline of 8% in the fourth quarter. The Company also experienced declining comparable sales in Canada and the UK, its two largest Company-operated International markets, primarily due to lower traffic. The Company believes that the weaker traffic has been caused by a number of ongoing factors in the global economies that have negatively impacted consumers’ discretionary spending, as well as factors within the Company’s control with respect to the pace of store openings in the US and store level execution. In the US, the economic factors included the higher cost of such basic consumer staples as gas and food, rising levels of unemployment and personal debt, reduced access to consumer credit, and lower home values as well as increased foreclosure activity in certain areas of the country (California and Florida) where Starbucks has a high concentration of Company-operated stores. These developments combined with recent and ongoing unprecedented shocks to the global financial system and capital markets have all contributed to sharp declines in consumer confidence in the US. Starbucks business is highly sensitive to increases and decreases in customer traffic. Increased customer visits create sales leverage, meaning that fixed expenses, such as occupancy costs, are spread across a greater revenue base, thereby improving operating margins. But the reverse is also true — sales de-leveraging creates downward pressure on margins. The softness in US revenues during fiscal 2008 impacted nearly all consolidated and US segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales. Since January 2008, when Company founder Howard Schultz reassumed the role of president and chief executive officer in addition to his role as chairman, Starbucks has taken steps to address the deterioration in the US retail environment and address its global support structure. These included the development and implementation of several important strategic initiatives as part of a transformation strategy designed to reinvigorate the Starbucks Experience for the Company’s customers, increase customer traffic in its US stores, reduce infrastructure expenses, and improve the Company’s results of operations. These significant actions have been designed to structure the Company’s business for long-term profitable growth. As a result of the continued weak economy and decreased customer traffic, as well as the costs associated with the store closures and other actions in its transformation strategy, the Company’s fiscal 2008 results were negatively impacted in the following ways: • Consolidated operating income was $503.9 million in fiscal 2008, and operating margin for the year was 4.9% compared with 11.2% in the prior year. Approximately 260 basis points of the decrease in operating margin was a result of restructuring charges, primarily related to the significant US store closures. Softness in US revenues along with higher cost of sales including occupancy costs and store operating expenses were also significant drivers in the margin decline. • EPS for fiscal 2008 was $0.43, compared to EPS of $0.87 per share earned in the prior year. Restructuring charges and costs associated with the execution of the transformation agenda impacted EPS by approximately $0.28 per share in fiscal 2008. 22 Table of Contents Significant Actions Taken in Fiscal 2008 The more significant actions taken by Starbucks in fiscal 2008 to transform and reinvigorate its business included: • A plan to close approximately 600 underperforming Company-operated stores in the US market, of which 205 were closed as of fiscal year-end with the remaining stores to be closed by the end of fiscal 2009; • Restructuring the Company’s Australia business by closing 61 Company-operated stores, focusing on the remaining 23 stores in three key metro areas; • Reducing approximately 1,000 open and filled positions within the Company’s leadership structure and its non-store organization, to rationalize its infrastructure for the reduced number of stores; and • Introducing new beverage platforms designed to reinvigorate the Starbucks beverage offerings, new breakfast food offerings and bakery and chilled foods, including health and wellness choices, and a new, everyday brewed coffee, Pike Placetm Roast, which returned the Company to the practice of grinding whole beans in stores and brewing every 30 minutes to provide customers with the freshest coffee possible. Fiscal 2009 — The View Ahead Management expects the Company to continue to face a very difficult economic environment throughout fiscal 2009, both in the US and internationally, including in its two largest Company-operated markets of Canada and the UK. As the global financial crisis has broadened and intensified, other sectors of the global economy have been adversely impacted and a severe global recession of uncertain length now appears likely. As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, the Company expects to face an extremely challenging fiscal 2009 because of these economic conditions. Accordingly, Starbucks expects to report negative comparable store sales for fiscal 2009. Additionally, the Company’s earnings for fiscal 2009 will be impacted by lease termination and severance costs from the US and Australia store closures, totaling up to an estimated $0.12 of EPS for fiscal 2009. The Company estimates that the combination of the US and Australia store closures and head count reductions will result in a pre-tax benefit to operating income of approximately $200 million to $210 million in fiscal 2009, which equates to approximately $0.17 to $0.18 of EPS. Starbucks plans to be disciplined in its approach to new store openings, in both Company-operated and licensed markets, and adjust as needed in response to further worsening in the global economy. Starbucks fiscal 2009 US store opening target is approximately a negative 20 net new stores, which includes a nearly 225 Company-operated store decline and approximately 205 net new licensed stores. Internationally, Starbucks is planning to open approximately 700 net new stores in fiscal 2009, two-thirds of which are expected to be licensed, as it factors in the current global economic climate, with a more cautious approach in the UK and western Europe. Operating Segment Overview Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: United States, International and CPG. The United States and International segments both include Company-operated retail stores, licensed retail stores and foodservice operations. Licensed stores frequently have a higher operating margin than Company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues, but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee. The International segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus Company-operated compared to the US segment; however, the US segment has been operating significantly longer than the International segment and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the more mature US segment has significantly more stores, and higher total revenues than the International segment. Average sales per store are also higher in the US due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels. Further, certain market costs, particularly occupancy costs, are lower in the US segment compared to the average for the International segment, which comprises a more diverse group of operations. As a result of the relative strength of the brand in the US segment, the number of stores, the higher unit volumes, and the lower market costs, the US segment, despite its higher relative percentage of Company-operated stores, has a higher operating margin, excluding restructuring costs, than the less-developed International segment. 23 Table of Contents The Company’s International store base continues to increase and Starbucks has been achieving a growing contribution from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets, such as China, Brazil and Russia. The Company’s newer international markets require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income. The CPG segment includes packaged coffee and tea as well as branded products operations worldwide. The CPG segment operates primarily through joint ventures and licensing arrangements with large consumer products business partners, most significantly The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company for distribution of ready-to-drink beverages, and with Kraft Foods Inc. for distribution of packaged coffees and teas. This operating model allows the CPG segment to leverage the business partners’ existing infrastructures and to extend the Starbucks brand in an efficient way. Most of the customer revenues from the ready-to-drink and packaged coffee channels are recognized as revenues by the joint venture or licensed business partner, not by the CPG segment, and the proportionate share of the results of the Company’s joint ventures are included on a net basis in “Income from equity investees” on the consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, the CPG segment reflects relatively lower revenues, a modest cost structure, and a resulting higher operating margin, compared to the Company’s other two reporting segments, which consist primarily of retail stores. Expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. These unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses, related depreciation and amortization expenses, restructuring charges and amounts included in “Interest income and other, net” and “Interest expense” on the consolidated statements of earnings. Acquisitions See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10-K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007 Consolidated results of operations (in millions): Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 % of Total Net Revenues STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS DATA Net revenues: Company-operated retail $ 8,771.9 $ 7,998.3 9.7 % 84.5 % 85.0 % Specialty: Licensing 1,171.6 1,026.3 14.2 11.3 10.9 Foodservice and other 439.5 386.9 13.6 4.2 4.1 Total specialty 1,611.1 1,413.2 14.0 15.5 15.0 Total net revenues $ 10,383.0 $ 9,411.5 10.3 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2008 increased due to growth in both Company-operated retail revenues and specialty operations. During fiscal 2008, Starbucks derived 84% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased, primarily attributable to the opening of 681 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, offset by negative 3% comparable store sales for the same period. Revenue growth was slower than in previous years due to a combination of declining comparable store sales and a decrease in the number of net new stores opened during fiscal 2008. The weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the US segment, which posted a comparable store sales decline of 5% for the year. Partially offsetting this was 2% comparable store sales growth in the International segment. Within fiscal 2008, consolidated quarterly revenue 24 Table of Contents growth decelerated each quarter and comparable store sales declined each quarter, reflecting the ongoing challenging economic conditions in the US. The Company derived the remaining 16% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores, collectively known as specialty operations. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded-product operations, increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 988 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. The increase in Foodservice and other revenues was primarily driven by growth in new and existing accounts in the US foodservice business. For fiscal 2009, the Company expects total revenues to be relatively flat compared to fiscal 2008, with variations driven by the level of comparable store sales. Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 % of Total Net Revenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 4,645.3 $ 3,999.1 16.2 % 44.7 % 42.5 % Store operating expenses(1) 3,745.1 3,215.9 16.5 36.1 34.2 Other operating expenses(2) 330.1 294.2 12.2 3.2 3.1 Depreciation and amortization expenses 549.3 467.2 17.6 5.3 5.0 General and administrative expenses 456.0 489.2 (6.8 ) 4.4 5.2 Restructuring charges 266.9 — nm 2.6 — Total operating expenses 9,992.7 8,465.6 18.0 96.2 89.9 Income from equity investees 113.6 108.0 5.2 1.1 1.1 Operating income $ 503.9 $ 1,053.9 (52.2 )% 4.9 % 11.2 % (1) As a percentage of related Company-operated retail revenues, store operating expenses were 42.7% and 40.2% for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. (2) As a percentage of related total specialty revenues, other operating expenses were 20.5% and 20.8% for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. As discussed in the Management Overview section above, many of the Company’s operating expenses are fixed in nature. As a result, the softness in US revenues during fiscal 2008 impacted nearly all consolidated and US segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales, and pressured operating margins. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues increased primarily due to higher payroll expenditures as a percentage of revenues coupled with impairment provisions in the US business, primarily driven by the slowdown in projected store openings. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the opening of 681 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll-related expenses. Restructuring charges include asset impairment, lease exit and severance costs. These costs are associated with the closure of underperforming stores in the US and Australia, and the rationalization of the Company’s leadership structure and non-store organization. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 25 Table of Contents Operating margin compression was primarily due to lower revenues; in addition, restructuring charges accounted for approximately 40% of the decrease. Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 % of Total Net Revenues Interest income and other, net $ 9.0 $ 40.4 (77.7 )% 0.1 % 0.4 % Interest expense (53.4 ) (38.0 ) 40.5 (0.5 ) (0.4 ) Earnings before income taxes 459.5 1,056.3 (56.5 ) 4.4 11.2 Income taxes 144.0 383.7 (62.5 ) 1.4 4.1 Net earnings $ 315.5 $ 672.6 (53.1 )% 3.0 % 7.1 % Interest income and other net, decreased due primarily to unrealized market value losses on the Company’s trading securities portfolio. As described in more detail in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the trading securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability under its Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). The MDCP liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance, with this offsetting impact recorded in “General and administrative expenses” on the consolidated statements of earnings. Interest expense increased due to the Company’s issuance of $550 million of 10-year 6.25% Senior Notes in August of fiscal 2007. Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2008 resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.3% compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2007. The lower rate is due to the higher proportion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions which have lower tax rates, as well as an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction for manufacturing activities in the US. Operating Segments Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Company’s management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: United States, International and CPG. “Unallocated Corporate” includes expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. Operating income represents earnings before “Interest income and other, net,” “Interest expense” and “Income taxes.” The following tables summarize the Company’s results of operations by segment for fiscal 2008 and 2007 (in millions). United States The United States operating segment sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise primarily through Company-operated retail stores. Specialty operations within the United States include licensed retail stores, foodservice accounts and other initiatives related to the Company’s core business. Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 As a % of US Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated retail $ 6,997.7 $ 6,560.9 6.7 % 88.7 % 89.3 % Specialty: Licensing 504.2 439.1 14.8 6.4 6.0 Foodservice and other 385.1 349.0 10.3 4.9 4.7 Total specialty 889.3 788.1 12.8 11.3 10.7 Total net revenues $ 7,887.0 $ 7,349.0 7.3 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 26 Table of Contents Company-operated retail revenues increased primarily due to the opening of 445 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, partially offset by a 5% decrease in comparable store sales for fiscal 2008. The US Company-operated retail business continued to experience deteriorating trends in transactions during the year, driven by the US economic slowdown. Licensing revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 438 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 As a % of US Total Net Revenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 3,371.7 $ 2,956.2 14.1 % 42.8 % 40.2 % Store operating expenses(1) 3,081.0 2,684.2 14.8 39.1 36.5 Other operating expenses(2) 219.6 204.8 7.2 2.8 2.8 Depreciation and amortization expenses 401.7 348.2 15.4 5.1 4.7 General and administrative expenses 72.7 85.9 (15.4 ) 0.9 1.2 Restructuring charges 210.9 — nm 2.7 — Total operating expenses 7,357.6 6,279.3 17.2 93.3 85.4 Income from equity investees (1.3 ) 0.8 nm — — Operating income $ 528.1 $ 1,070.5 (50.7 )% 6.7 % 14.6 % (1) As a percentage of related Company-operated retail revenues, store operating expenses were 44.0% and 40.9% for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. (2) As a percentage of related total specialty revenues, other operating expenses were 24.7% and 26.0% for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. Operating margin contracted significantly primarily due to restructuring charges incurred and to softer revenues due to weak traffic, as well as higher cost of sales including occupancy costs and higher store operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Restructuring charges of $210.9 million had a 270 basis point impact on the operating margin. The increase in cost of sales including occupancy costs was primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues. Higher store operating expenses was due to the softer sales, higher payroll-related expenditures, and charges from canceling future store sites and asset impairments. International The International operating segment sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through Company-operated retail stores in Canada, the UK and nine other markets. Specialty operations primarily include retail store licensing operations in nearly forty other countries and foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada and Japan. The Company’s International store base continues to increase and Starbucks expects to achieve a growing contribution from established areas of the business while at the same time investing in emerging markets and channels. Many of the Company’s International operations are in early stages of development that require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than in the United States. This continuing investment is part of the Company’s long-term, balanced plan for profitable growth. 27 Table of Contents Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 As a % of International Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated retail $ 1,774.2 $ 1,437.4 23.4 % 84.3 % 84.7 % Specialty: Licensing 274.8 220.9 24.4 13.1 13.0 Foodservice and other 54.4 37.9 43.5 2.6 2.2 Total specialty 329.2 258.8 27.2 15.7 15.3 Total net revenues $ 2,103.4 $ 1,696.2 24.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Company-operated retail revenues increased due to the opening of 236 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months, favorable foreign currency exchange rates, primarily on the Canadian dollar, and comparable store sales growth of 2% for fiscal 2008. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, Company-operated retail revenues grew at a slower rate year-over-year of 12% and comparable store sales were flat compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2007, both driven by slowdowns in the UK and Canada, due to the weakening global economy. Specialty revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 550 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months.

(2) As a percentage of related total specialty revenues, other operating expenses were 26.9% and 27.0% for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. Operating margin decreased primarily due to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs driven by continued expansion of lunch and warming programs in Canada, higher distribution costs, and higher building maintenance expense due to store renovation activities. In addition, restructuring charges of $19.2 million recognized in fiscal 2008 had a 90 basis point impact on the operating margin, nearly all due to the closure of 61 Company-operated stores in Australia. Global Consumer Products Group The CPG operating segment sells a selection of whole bean and ground coffees and premium Tazo® teas through licensing arrangements in United States and international markets. CPG also produces and sells a variety of ready-to-drink beverages through its joint ventures and marketing and distribution agreements. 28 Table of Contents Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 As a % of CPG Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Licensing $ 392.6 $ 366.3 7.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Total specialty 392.6 366.3 7.2 100.0 100.0 Total net revenues increased primarily due to higher royalties and product sales in the international ready-to-drink business and increased sales of US packaged tea and International club packaged coffee.

During the fiscal year ended 2007, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company-operated retail stores. Company-operated retail revenues increased primarily due to the opening of 1,342 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 5% for the fiscal year ended 2007. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the average value per transaction and a 1% increase in the number of customer transactions. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company-operated retail stores, collectively known as specialty operations. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded-product operations, increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,229 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and a 20% increase in licensing revenues from the Company’s CPG business. Foodservice and other revenues increased due to growth in new and existing accounts in the US foodservice business.

Dairy expense for the US segment represents approximately 75% of the total Company’s dairy expense. For the US segment the average dairy costs per gallon rose 10% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, resulting in approximately $20 million of additional expense. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company-operated retail revenues decreased primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year due to exceptionally strong performance as well as leverage on regional overhead costs in fiscal 2007. Other operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of controlled discretionary spending in fiscal 2007. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the opening of 1,342 new Company-operated retail stores in the last 12 months. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher payroll-related expenditures in support of continued global growth, offset in part by unusually high charitable contributions in fiscal 2006. Income from equity investees increased primarily due to higher equity income from international investees. Operating margin compression was due to higher costs of sales and occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a shift in sales to higher cost products and higher distribution costs, rent expense and dairy costs. These cost pressures were offset in part by leveraging general and administrative expenses, store operating expenses, and other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues.

The US Company-operated retail business experienced deteriorating trends in transactions late in the year, driven by, management believes, the US economic slowdown combined with two price increases in US retail stores implemented in fiscal 2007. Licensing revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 723 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months.

Partially offsetting these were lower store operating expenses, lower general and administrative expenses, and lower other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. The decline in store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year as well as leverage on regional overhead costs in fiscal 2007.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company’s existing cash and liquid investments were $322.3 million and $459.7 million as of September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. The decrease in liquid investments was driven primarily by $59.8 million of auction rate securities, nearly all of which are held within the Company’s wholly owned captive insurance company, that are not currently considered liquid and were reclassified to long-term investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. 34 Table of Contents Included in the cash and liquid investment balances are the following: • A portfolio of unrestricted trading securities, designed to hedge the Company’s liability under its Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). The value of this portfolio was $49.5 million and $73.6 million as of September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. The decrease was driven by the sale of a bond income fund to better align with the Company’s total risk profile and declines in market values of the underlying equity funds, which were offset by a comparable decline in the MDCP liability. • Unrestricted cash and liquid securities, held within the Company’s wholly owned captive insurance company, to fund claim payouts. The value of these unrestricted cash and liquid securities was approximately $35.6 million and $98.1 million as of September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. The decrease was due primarily to reclassification of auction rate securities held by the wholly owned captive. As described in more detail in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, as of September 28, 2008, the Company had $74.4 million invested in available-for-sale securities, consisting primarily of auction rate securities. While the ongoing auction failures will limit the liquidity of these investments for some period of time, the Company does not believe the auction failures will materially impact its ability to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures or other business requirements. The Company manages the balance of its cash and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs and make scheduled interest and principal payments on its borrowings. Following the Company’s announcement on July 1, 2008 that it planned to close approximately 600 underperforming US Company-operated stores and reduce new store growth in fiscal year 2009, Standard & Poor’s placed the BBB+ long-term rating and A-2 short term ratings for Starbucks on CreditWatch with negative implications. On July 3, 2008, Moody’s placed the Baa1 senior unsecured rating for Starbucks on review for possible downgrade, however Moody’s reaffirmed the Company’s Prime-2 short-term rating for commercial paper. Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s subsequently downgraded the long-term ratings as of September 4, 2008 and November 17, 2008, respectively. Credit rating agencies currently rate the Company’s borrowings as follows: Description Standard & Poor’s Moody’s Short term debt A-2 P-2 Senior unsecured long term debt BBB Baa2 Outlook Stable Negative • Standard & Poor’s downgraded the Company’s long-term rating from BBB+ to BBB on September 4, 2008, and re-affirmed the A-2 short-term rating. At the same time, Standard & Poor’s outlook was changed to stable. • Moody’s downgraded the Company’s long-term rating from Baa1 to Baa2 on November 17, 2008, and re-affirmed the Company’s Prime-2 short term rating for commercial paper. At the same time, Moody’s outlook was changed to negative. Factors that may affect credit ratings include changes in the Company’s operating performance, the economic environment and the Company’s capital structure. In order to maintain its credit ratings, there is an expectation that the Company will modestly reduce its leverage during fiscal 2009. The Company expects to improve its leverage ratio below a certain target level primarily through the reduction in short term borrowings. Credit rating downgrades can adversely impact, among other things, future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, and future operating lease terms. If either of the Company’s short-term ratings were downgraded, it would likely make the issuance of commercial paper difficult. In these circumstances the Company could draw upon its credit facility. In normal market conditions, it is generally more favorable for the Company to issue commercial paper rather than borrow against the credit facility. However, as described in Item 1A Risk Factors the ongoing global financial crisis may result in conditions where commercial paper is not available at reasonable rates. In such situations the Company is more likely to draw on its credit facility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company borrowed against the credit facility as liquidity conditions in the commercial paper market deteriorated. As of September 28, 2008, borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaled $300 million. 35 Table of Contents The Company’s credit facility contains provisions requiring Starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, the Company was in compliance with each of these covenants. On October 31, 2008, the Company entered into an amendment to the credit facility to exclude up to $130 million of lease termination expenses and lease exit costs incurred during the period beginning on June 30, 2008 and ending September 27, 2009 from the agreement’s “Operating Lease and Rental Expense” definition. The purpose of the amendment was to limit the short-term effects of lease-related restructuring expenses from the Company’s store closure actions on the fixed charge coverage ratio. These expenses would have otherwise put pressure on the coverage ratio and raised the risk of the Company losing access to liquidity. Over the long term, the reduction in lease expense and improvement in operating cash flows resulting from these store closures are expected to have a favorable effect on this coverage ratio. The amendment also increased the cost to borrow under the facility by an additional 0.10% to 0.40%, depending on the Company’s fixed charge ratio and its senior unsecured debt rating. The $550 million of 10-year 6.25% Senior Notes, issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, also require Starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants that limit future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, the Company was in compliance with each of these covenants. The Company expects to use its cash and liquid investments, including any borrowings under its revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to invest in its core businesses, including new beverage innovations, as well as other new business opportunities related to its core businesses. The Company may use its available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees. Any decisions to increase its ownership interest in its equity method investees or licensed operations will be driven by valuation and fit with the Company’s ownership strategy and are likely to be infrequent. Depending on market conditions and within the constraint of maintaining an appropriate capital structure, Starbucks may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. Due to the current challenging operating and economic environment, the Company continues to be conservative in its uses of cash and did not repurchase any shares in the second, third or fourth quarters of fiscal 2008. Management also does not currently anticipate any share repurchases in fiscal 2009. Management believes that cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and liquid investments should be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses for the foreseeable future, as well as to fund the cost of lease termination and severance costs from the US and Australia store closures. As a result, the Company expects to decrease short-term borrowings in fiscal 2009. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2009 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new Company-operated retail stores, remodeling and refurbishment of existing Company-operated retail stores, and new equipment to support enhanced quality standards and expanded offerings in the stores. Other capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 are expected to consist principally of investments in information technology systems and in the Company’s global supply chain operations. Total expenditures for fiscal 2009 are expected to be approximately $700 million. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $72.5 million to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2008 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2007. The modest decrease was primarily due to the slowing pace of store construction which led to a decline in the balance in accounts payable year-over-year. Cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2008 totaled $1.1 billion. Net capital additions to property, plant and equipment used $984.5 million, primarily from opening new Company-operated retail stores and remodeling certain existing stores during fiscal 2008. In addition, the sale and maturity of available-for-sale securities provided $75.9 million and $20.0 million, respectively, for fiscal 2008, consisting primarily of auction rate securities and agency notes. The auction rate securities were sold through the normal auction process prior to the auction failures that began in mid-February 2008, as described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, and the agency notes, issued by government-sponsored enterprises, were called in the first half of fiscal 2008. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2008 totaled $184.5 million. Cash used to repurchase shares of the Company’s common stock totaled $311.4 million, all in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. This amount includes the 36 Table of Contents effect of the net change in unsettled trades from September 30, 2007 of $16.1 million. Net repayments of commercial paper were $297.2 million and net borrowings under short term borrowings were $299.4 million for fiscal 2008. As of September 28, 2008, a total of $713.2 million in borrowings were outstanding under the combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility, as well as $15.9 million in letters of credit which were outstanding under the credit facility, leaving $270.9 million of capacity available under the $1 billion combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. Partially offsetting cash used for share repurchases were proceeds of $112.3 million from the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of the Company’s common stock from employee stock purchase plans. As options granted are exercised, Starbucks will continue to receive proceeds and a tax deduction, but the amount and the timing of these cash flows cannot be reliably predicted as option holders’ decisions to exercise options will be largely driven by movements in the Company’s stock price. The following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 28, 2008, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the Company’s liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 - 3 3 - 5 More than Contractual Obligations(1) Total Year Years Years 5 Years Debt obligations(2) $ 1,573.9 $ 748.4 $ 69.2 $ 68.8 $ 687.5 Operating lease obligations(3) 5,098.1 741.0 1,367.2 1,151.1 1,838.8 Purchase obligations(4) 682.3 575.5 93.2 11.1 2.5 Other obligations(5) 102.3 4.1 11.2 8.6 78.4 Total $ 7,456.6 $ 2,069.0 $ 1,540.8 $ 1,239.6 $ 2,607.2 (1) Liabilities for incomes taxes under FIN 48 were excluded as the Company is not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. As of September 28, 2008, the Company had $52.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits under FIN 48. (2) Debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments on commercial paper, credit facility borrowings, and long-term debt. (3) Amounts include the direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (4) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Purchase obligations relate primarily to green coffee. (5) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations, capital lease obligations and hedging instruments. Starbucks expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business, as well as ongoing borrowings under the combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement The Company’s off-balance sheet arrangements relate to certain guarantees and are detailed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10-K. COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents the Company’s primary market risk, generated by its purchases of green coffee and dairy products. The Company purchases, roasts and sells high-quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, the Company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of its Company-operated retail stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the Company’s results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K. 37 Table of Contents FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices, and interest rates. The Company manages its exposure to various market-based risks according to an umbrella risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the dollar risk to net earnings. The Company also monitors and limits the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. Additionally, this policy restricts, among other things, the amount of market-based risk the Company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity. In general, hedge instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years. The sensitivity analyses performed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. Commodity Price Risk The Company purchases commodity inputs, including coffee and dairy products that are used in its operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact its financial results. In addition to fixed-priced contracts and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, the Company may enter into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices of its commodity hedges, as of the end of fiscal 2008, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of the Company’s revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in US dollars. However, because a portion of the Company’s operations consists of activities outside of the United States, the Company has transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, euro, and Japanese yen. As a result, Starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues, inventory purchases, assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of September 28, 2008, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases. In addition, Starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of its net investment in Starbucks Japan, as well as the Company’s net investments in its Canada, UK, and China subsidiaries, to minimize foreign currency exposure. The Company also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes (free standing derivatives), but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables. Increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the US dollar value of the Company’s foreign currency denominated payables and receivables (i.e. “hedged items”) that would occur within the hedging period. The following table summarizes the potential impact to the Company’s future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the US dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): September 28, 2008 Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 68 (56 ) 15 (19 ) 38 Table of Contents Equity Security Price Risk The Company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds within its trading portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability under the MDCP. A corresponding liability is included in “Accrued compensation and related costs” on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in “Interest income and other, net” in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in “General and administrative expenses.” The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of its investments, as of the end of fiscal 2008, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Interest Rate Risk The Company utilizes short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt. At the end of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, the Company did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding. The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of the Company’s debt (in millions): September 28, 2008 Change in Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase in 100 Basis Point Decrease in Fair Value Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Debt $ 1,251 (35 ) 35 The Company’s available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income.” The Company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its available-for-sale securities. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of its available-for-sale securities as of the end of fiscal 2008, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results, and require management’s most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Starbucks considers its policies on asset impairment, stock-based compensation, operating leases, self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Asset Impairment When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses. For goodwill and other intangible assets, impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the Company’s trademarks. Upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations. Judgments made by the Company related to 39 Table of Contents the expected useful lives of long-lived assets and the ability of the Company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. As the Company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long-lived assets, these factors could cause the Company to realize material impairment charges. Stock-based Compensation Starbucks accounts for stock-based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), “Share-Based Payment.” The Company uses the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them (“expected term”), the estimated volatility of the Company’s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (“forfeitures”). Changes in the subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation; however based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term, management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal 2008 would not have been material. Operating Leases Starbucks leases retail stores, roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases. The Company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term. Estimating AROs involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs. Future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated. In addition, the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which the Company has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of ARO expense, as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent. Starbucks accounts for lease contract termination costs in accordance with SFAS 146, “Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.” Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate. Self Insurance Reserves The Company uses a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for the potential liabilities for workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, director and officers’ liability insurance and vehicle liability. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes Starbucks accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, “Accounting for Income Taxes,” which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are accounted for under FASB Interpretation No. 48, “Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109” (“FIN 48”). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. These include establishing a valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets. Accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments, including estimating the amount, timing and likelihood of ultimate settlement. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. 40 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this 10-K.

829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2010,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Starbucks Corporation’s fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal year ended on October 3, 2010 included 53 weeks with the 53rd week falling in our fourth fiscal quarter. Fiscal years ended on September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008 both included 52 weeks. Comparable store sales percentages below are calculated excluding the 53rd week. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Financial Highlights • Consolidated operating income was $1.4 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to $562 million in fiscal 2009, and the operating margin increased to 13.3% compared to 5.7% in fiscal 2009. The operating margin expansion was driven by increased sales leverage and the continued benefits from operational efficiencies. Comparable store sales growth at company-operated stores was 7% in fiscal 2010 compared to a decline of 6% in fiscal 2009. Lower restructuring charges in fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year also contributed approximately 290 basis points of the increase in operating margin. • EPS for fiscal 2010 was $1.24, compared to EPS of $0.52 reported in fiscal 2009, with the increase driven by the improved sales leverage and the continued benefits from operational efficiencies. Restructuring charges impacted EPS by approximately $0.04 per share in fiscal 2010 and approximately $0.28 in fiscal 2009. • Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2010 compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2009, and capital expenditures were approximately $440 million in both fiscal years. Available operating cash flow after capital expenditures during fiscal 2010 was directed at returning approximately $460 million of cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends, and investing in short term investment grade securities. Overview Starbucks results for fiscal 2010 demonstrate the ongoing success of our efforts over the last two years to improve the health of our core business and to position the Company for sustained, profitable growth into the future. Strong comparable stores sales growth of 7% for the year (US 7% and International 6%), combined with a more efficient operating structure drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margins and net earnings. The operational improvements implemented throughout fiscal 2009 in our supply chain and company-operated stores have driven reduced product costs and store waste as well as in-store labor savings, concurrent with improved customer satisfaction scores. These improvements were partially offset by higher performance based compensation expenses in fiscal 2010 and by higher marketing expenses to support the launch of Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew in the grocery channel and the introduction of our new customizable Frappuccino® blended beverage. In our US business we will continue to refine our store efficiency efforts while pursuing a consistently high level of customer satisfaction. While the reinvigorated US business has been the primary driver of Starbucks improved consolidated financial results, the profitability of our international business continues to improve, driven primarily by increased sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies. Our management continues to focus on our international business by leveraging the valuable lessons learned in the US. We intend to capitalize on the large expansion opportunities that exist outside the US, including continued growth and scale in our more mature existing markets, and emphasis on expansion in key emerging markets like China and Brazil. Our global consumer products group (“CPG”) represents another important profitable growth opportunity for us as we accelerate both product innovation and distribution. We are aggressively pursuing the opportunities beyond our more traditional store experience to offer consumers new coffee products in multiple forms, across new categories, and through diverse channels, leveraging our strong brand and established retail store base. Examples include the ongoing expansion of our successful Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew product and the ongoing growth in points of distribution for Seattle’s Best Coffee. Starbucks continues to generate strong operating cash flows, which provide us the financial flexibility to continue disciplined investment and spending in both our core business and new growth platforms, while also returning cash 22 Table of Contents to shareholders. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow in fiscal 2010 and finished the year with $1.4 billion in cash and short-term investments and no short-term debt. In fiscal 2010 we returned approximately $460 million of cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Fiscal 2011 — The View Ahead • For fiscal 2011, we expect revenues to grow in the mid-to-high single digits based on a 52-week comparable year, driven by low to mid single-digit comparable store sales growth. We plan to open approximately 500 net new stores globally in fiscal 2011; approximately 100 in the U.S. and approximately 400 internationally, the majority of which are expected to be licensed stores. • We expect modest improvement in our consolidated operating margin in fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year, given our current revenue expectations, our anticipation of no restructuring charges in fiscal 2011, along with ongoing marketing spend for Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew and higher coffee commodity costs. • We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million to $600 million for the full year. Operating Segment Overview Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: US, International, and CPG. In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we changed the composition of our reportable segments by creating a Seattle’s Best Coffee operating segment and reporting it with our unallocated corporate expenses and Digital Ventures in Other. Financial information for Seattle’s Best Coffee was previously reported within the US, International, and CPG segments. The US and International segments both include company-operated retail stores and licensed retail stores. Licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues, but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee. The International segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus company-operated compared to the US segment; however, the US segment has been operating significantly longer than the International segment and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the more mature US segment has significantly more stores, and higher total revenues than the International segment. Average sales per store are also higher in the US due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels. Further, certain market costs, particularly occupancy costs, are lower in the US segment compared to the average for the International segment, which comprises a more diverse group of operations. As a result of the relative strength of the brand in the US segment, the number of stores, the higher unit volumes, and the lower market costs, the US segment, despite its higher relative percentage of company-operated stores, has a higher operating margin, excluding restructuring costs, than the less-developed International segment. Starbucks International store base continues to expand and as we continue to focus on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets, such as China and Brazil. Newer international markets require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income. The CPG segment includes packaged coffee and tea and other branded products operations worldwide, and the US foodservice business. For over ten years through licensing relationships with Kraft Foods Global, Inc., we have sold a selection of Starbucks and Seattle’s Best Coffee branded packaged coffees and Tazo® teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the US, and to grocery stores in Canada, the UK and other European countries. Kraft has managed the distribution, marketing, advertising and promotion of these products. In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, Starbucks notified Kraft that we are discontinuing our licensing relationships. We intend to work closely with Kraft to ensure an orderly transition. We also sell packaged coffee and tea internationally directly to warehouse club stores, such as Costco Wholesale Corporation. Our CPG segment also includes ready-to-drink beverages which are manufactured and distributed through The North American Coffee Partnership, a joint venture with the Pepsi-Cola Company. In the CPG segment, most of the customer revenues from the packaged coffee and ready-to-drink products are recognized as revenues by the licensed or joint venture business partner. Royalties and payments from our licensing agreements are recorded under licensing revenue, and the proportionate share of the results of the joint venture are included, on a net basis, in 23 Table of Contents income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings. The US foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broadline distribution networks. The CPG segment reflects relatively lower revenues, a modest cost structure, and a resulting higher operating margin, compared to the other two reporting segments, which consist primarily of retail stores.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009 Consolidated results of operations (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 %Change Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 % of Total NetRevenues Net revenues: Company-operated retail $ 8,963.5 $ 8,180.1 9.6 % 83.7 % 83.7 % Specialty: Licensing 1,340.9 1,222.3 9.7 % 12.5 % 12.5 % Foodservice and other 403.0 372.2 8.3 % 3.8 % 3.8 % Total specialty 1,743.9 1,594.5 9.4 % 16.3 % 16.3 % Total net revenues $ 10,707.4 $ 9,774.6 9.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Consolidated net revenues were $10.7 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 9.5% over fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in company-operated retail revenues driven by a 7% increase in global comparable stores sales (contributing approximately $551 million). The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in number of transactions (contributing approximately $298 million) and a 3% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $253 million). Also contributing to the increase in revenues was the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $207 million), foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the US dollar primarily in relation to the Canadian dollar (approximately $101 million), and the effect of consolidating our previous joint venture in France (approximately $87 million). This increase was partially offset by a net decrease of 72 company-operated stores from fiscal 2009 (approximately $119 million). Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 % of Total NetRevenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 4,458.6 $ 4,324.9 41.6 % 44.2 % Store operating expenses 3,551.4 3,425.1 33.2 % 35.0 % Other operating expenses 293.2 264.4 2.7 % 2.7 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 510.4 534.7 4.8 % 5.5 % General and administrative expenses 569.5 453.0 5.3 % 4.6 % Restructuring charges 53.0 332.4 0.5 % 3.4 % Total operating expenses 9,436.1 9,334.5 88.1 % 95.5 % Income from equity investees 148.1 121.9 1.4 % 1.2 % Operating income $ 1,419.4 $ 562.0 13.3 % 5.7 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 39.6 % 41.9 % Other operating expenses 16.8 % 16.6 % 24 Table of Contents Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased 260 basis points. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies which contributed to lower food costs (approximately 70 basis points) and lower beverage and paper packaging product costs (approximately 50 basis points). Also contributing to the decrease were lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 80 basis points) primarily due to sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated retail revenues decreased 230 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage from increased revenues. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure in fiscal 2009 and 2008. The restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2010 reflect charges incurred on the previously announced store closures. With the previously-announced store closures essentially complete, we do not expect to report any further restructuring costs related to these activities. Partially offsetting these favorable fluctuations were increased advertising costs included primarily in other operating expenses and higher performance based compensation expenses, which drove the 70 basis point increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues. Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 % of Total NetRevenues Operating income $ 1,419.4 $ 562.0 13.3 % 5.7 % Interest income and other, net 50.3 37.0 0.5 % 0.4 % Interest expense (32.7 ) (39.1 ) (0.3 )% (0.4 )% Earnings before income taxes 1,437.0 559.9 13.4 % 5.7 % Income taxes 488.7 168.4 4.6 % 1.7 % Net earnings including noncontrolling interests 948.3 391.5 8.9 % 4.0 % Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 2.7 0.7 0 0 Net earnings attributable to Starbucks $ 945.6 $ 390.8 8.8 % 4.0 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 34.0 % 30.1 % Net interest income and other increased $13 million over the prior period. The increase was driven by the impact of an accounting gain recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to our acquisition of a controlling interest in our previous joint venture operations in France. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the carrying value of the previously held joint venture interest was adjusted to fair value upon the acquisition of the controlling interest. Also contributing to the increase were favorable fluctuations in unrealized holding gains on our trading securities portfolio of approximately $10 million. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Company’s liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). The MDCP liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance, with this offsetting impact recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. This favorability was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (approximately $11 million), which relate primarily to the revaluation of certain trade payables and receivables. Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2010 resulted in an effective tax rate of 34.0% compared to 30.1% for fiscal 2009. The lower rate in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the benefits recognized for retroactive tax credits and an audit settlement. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35%. 25 Table of Contents Operating Segments The following tables summarize the Company’s results of operations by segment for fiscal 2010 and 2009 (in millions). United States Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 As a % of US TotalNet Revenues Total net revenues $ 7,560.4 $ 7,061.7 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 2,906.1 $ 2,941.4 38.4 % 41.7 % Store operating expenses 2,831.9 2,815.1 37.5 % 39.9 % Other operating expenses 55.6 66.6 0.7 % 0.9 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 350.7 377.9 4.6 % 5.4 % General and administrative expenses 97.8 84.8 1.3 % 1.2 % Restructuring charges 27.2 246.3 0.4 % 3.5 % Total operating expenses 6,269.3 6,532.1 82.9 % 92.5 % Income from equity investees 0.0 0.5 0.0 % 0.0 % Operating income $ 1,291.1 $ 530.1 17.1 % 7.5 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 40.3 % 42.8 % Other operating expenses 10.5 % 13.6 % US net revenues increased primarily due to an increase in company-operated retail revenues of 7%. This increase is primarily due to a 7% increase in comparable store sales (contributing approximately $452 million), comprised of a 3% increase in transactions (contributing approximately $222 million), and a 4% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $230 million). Also contributing to the increase in total net revenues was the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $143 million), partially offset by a net decrease of 57 company-operated stores from fiscal 2009 (approximately $125 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased by 330 basis points over the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies which contributed to lower food costs (approximately 90 basis points) and lower beverage and paper packaging product costs (approximately 60 basis points). Also contributing to the decrease were lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 100 basis points) primarily due to sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percent of related retail revenues decreased 250 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio. Restructuring charges in fiscal 2010 decreased $219 million from 2009 due to the completion of our restructuring efforts in the US during the current year. 26 Table of Contents International Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 As a % ofInternational TotalNet Revenues Total net revenues $ 2,288.8 $ 1,914.3 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 1,078.2 $ 961.3 47.1 % 50.2 % Store operating expenses 719.5 610.0 31.4 % 31.9 % Other operating expenses 85.7 71.2 3.7 % 3.7 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 108.6 102.2 4.7 % 5.3 % General and administrative expenses 126.6 105.0 5.5 % 5.5 % Restructuring charges 25.8 27.0 1.1 % 1.4 % Total operating expenses 2,144.4 1,876.7 93.7 % 98.0 % Income from equity investees 80.8 53.6 3.5 % 2.8 % Operating income $ 225.2 $ 91.2 9.8 % 4.8 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 37.2 % 37.9 % Other operating expenses 24.0 % 23.2 % International net revenues increased due to foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the US dollar primarily in relation to the Canadian dollar (approximately $101 million), comparable store sales of 6% (contributing approximately $99 million), the effect of consolidating our previous joint venture in France (approximately $87 million), and the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $45 million). The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in transactions (contributing approximately $78 million), and a 1% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $21 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased by 310 basis points compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower costs for food and beverage components resulting from supply chain efficiencies (approximately 120 basis points). Also contributing to the decrease were lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 120 basis points) primarily due to sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percent of related retail revenues decreased 70 basis points primarily due to reduced impairments in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio. Restructuring charges in fiscal 2010 decreased slightly from 2009 due to the completion of our restructuring efforts internationally by the end of the current year.

Operating expenses included in Other relate to Seattle’s Best Coffee and Digital Ventures as well as expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support our operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. Total operating expenses increased $40.5 million primarily as a result of increased general and administrative expenses ($80 million) primarily due to higher performance-based compensation in 2010. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $58 million in restructuring charges due to the completion of our restructuring activities within the non-store support organization.

Foreign currency translation also contributed to the decline with the effects of a stronger US dollar relative to the British pound and Canadian dollar. The weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the US segment, with a comparable store sales decline of 6% for the year. The International segment experienced a 2% decline in comparable store sales. 28 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended Sep 27,2009 Sep 28,2008 Sep 27,2009 Sep 28,2008 % of Total NetRevenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 4,324.9 $ 4,645.3 44.2 % 44.7 % Store operating expenses 3,425.1 3,745.1 35.0 % 36.1 % Other operating expenses 264.4 330.1 2.7 % 3.2 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 534.7 549.3 5.5 % 5.3 % General and administrative expenses 453.0 456.0 4.6 % 4.4 % Restructuring charges 332.4 266.9 3.4 % 2.6 % Total operating expenses 9,334.5 9,992.7 95.5 % 96.2 % Income from equity investees 121.9 113.6 1.2 % 1.1 % Operating income $ 562.0 $ 503.9 5.7 % 4.9 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 41.9 % 42.7 % Other operating expenses 16.6 % 20.5 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the implementation of in-store operational efficiencies designed to reduce product waste, and due to lower dairy costs in the US, partially offset by higher coffee costs. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated retail revenues decreased primarily due to reduced headcount and spending in the regional support organization as a result of our restructuring efforts, and the effect of initiatives to improve store labor efficiencies. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure. Operating margin expansion was primarily due to the improved labor efficiency and reduced product waste in company-operated stores, partially offset by increased restructuring charges.

Also contributing to the increase were lower unrealized market value losses on our trading securities portfolio compared to fiscal 2008. Interest expense decreased due to a lower average balance of short term borrowings and lower average short term borrowing rates in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. At the end of fiscal 2009, we had no short term debt. The relatively low 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized for retroactive tax credits and an income tax credit related to the settlement of an employment tax audit in fiscal 2009. As a result of the audit settlement, approximately $17 million of expense was recorded in store operating expenses, with an offsetting income tax credit and no impact to net earnings. 29 Table of Contents United States Fiscal Year Ended Sep 27,2009 Sep 28,2008 Sep 27,2009 Sep 28,2008 As a % of US TotalNet Revenues Total net revenues $ 7,061.7 $ 7,491.2 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 2,941.4 $ 3,184.1 41.7 % 42.5 % Store operating expenses 2,815.1 3,080.9 39.9 % 41.1 % Other operating expenses 66.6 95.6 0.9 % 1.3 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 377.9 395.1 5.4 % 5.3 % General and administrative expenses 84.8 69.3 1.2 % 0.9 % Restructuring charges 246.3 210.9 3.5 % 2.8 % Total operating expenses 6,532.1 7,035.9 92.5 % 93.9 % Income from equity investees 0.5 (1.3 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % Operating income $ 530.1 $ 454.0 7.5 % 6.1 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 42.8 % 44.0 % Other operating expenses 13.6 % 19.4 % Company-operated retail revenues decreased year over year primarily due to a 6% decrease in comparable store sales, comprised of a 4% decrease in transactions, and a 2% decrease in average value per transaction. Operating margin expanded primarily due to lower store operating expenses, lower cost of sales including occupancy costs, and lower other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues. This improvement was primarily due to operational changes designed to improve labor efficiency and reduce product waste in company-operated stores, and to lower non-store support costs. Partially offsetting the favorability were higher restructuring charges during the year. We incurred higher lease exit and related costs due to the higher number of actual store closures compared to the prior year period.

Partially offsetting the decrease were the net new store openings during the fiscal year. Specialty revenues decreased primarily due to continued softness in the hospitality industry and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Operating margin decreased primarily due to higher restructuring charges and higher store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues. Restructuring charges of $27.0 million recognized during the year had a 50 basis point impact on operating margin compared to the prior year, due to the previously announced store closures. Higher store operating expenses as of percentage of company-operated retail revenues were driven by an increase in store impairment charges and a decline in sales leverage impacting salaries and benefits. Partially offsetting the decrease in operating margin were lower other operating expenses due to headcount reductions in the non-store support functions.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Starbucks cash and short-term investments were $1.4 billion and $666 million as of October 3, 2010 and September 27, 2009, respectively. We actively manage our cash and short-term investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, and return cash to shareholders through common stock dividend payments and share repurchases. Our short-term investments consisted predominantly of US Treasury and US Agency securities. Our portfolio of long-term available for sale securities consists predominantly of high investment-grade corporate bonds, diversified among industries and individual issuers. We also have investments in auction rate securities (“ARS”), nearly all of which are classified as long-term. ARS totaling $41 million and $56 million were outstanding as of October 3, 2010 and September 27, 2009, respectively. The reduction in ARS was due to $12 million in redemptions during the fiscal year with all redemptions done at par. While the ongoing auction failures will limit the liquidity of these ARS investments for some period of time, we do not believe the auction failures will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, shareholder dividends or other business requirements. Starbucks $1 billion unsecured credit facility (the “2005 credit facility”) was available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes. In November of 2010, subsequent to the end of the 2010 fiscal year, we replaced the 2005 credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in August 2011. The new credit facility is described in more detail below. The 2005 credit facility was paired with a commercial paper program whereby we could issue unsecured commercial paper notes, up to a maximum amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion. The commercial paper program was secured by the credit facility, and the combined borrowing limit was $1 billion for the commercial paper program and the credit facility. During fiscal 2010 and 2009, there were no borrowings under the 2005 credit facility or commercial paper program. As of October 3, 2010, a total of $15 million in letters of credit were outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The 2005 credit facility contained provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of October 3, 2010 and September 27, 2009, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. The $550 million of 10-year 6.25% Senior Notes also require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of October 3, 2010 and September 27, 2009, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. In November of 2010, subsequent to the end of the 2010 fiscal year, we replaced the 2005 credit facility with a $500 million unsecured credit facility (the “2010 credit facility”) with various banks, of which $100 million may be 32 Table of Contents used for issuances of letters of credit. The 2010 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. The new 2010 credit facility is currently set to mature in November 2014. The interest rate for any borrowings under the credit facility, based on Starbucks current ratings and fixed charge coverage ratio, is 1.50% over LIBOR. The specific spread over LIBOR will depend upon our long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies and our fixed charge coverage ratio. The credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. Starbucks has the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. Under Starbucks commercial paper program we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 million, with individual maturities that may vary, but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The program is backstopped by the 2010 credit facility, and the combined borrowing limit is $500 million for the commercial paper program and the credit facility. Starbucks may issue commercial paper from time to time, and the proceeds of the commercial paper financing will be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We expect to use our cash and short-term investments, including any potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in our core businesses, including new product innovations and related marketing support, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses. We believe that cash flow generated from operations and existing cash and short-term investments should be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. We may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees. Any decisions to increase ownership interest in our equity method investees or licensed operations will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2011 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing company-operated retail stores; systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure; and new company-operated retail stores. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 are expected to range from $550 million to $600 million. In March 2010, Starbucks declared its first ever cash dividend to shareholders at $0.10 per share. This quarterly dividend was paid on April 23, 2010. The third quarter dividend was raised to $0.13 per share and was paid on August 20, 2010, bringing the total cash dividend payout for fiscal 2010 to $171 million. On September 14, 2010, we declared a cash dividend of $0.13 per share to be paid on December 3, 2010 with an expected payout of $97 million. Starbucks repurchased 11 million shares of common stock ($286 million) during fiscal 2010 under share repurchase authorizations. The number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the fiscal year totaled 10 million. Subsequent to year end, on November 15, 2010 we announced an additional share repurchase authorization made by the Board of Directors in the amount of up to 10 million shares in addition to the 10 million remaining under the previous authorization. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for fiscal 2010 as compared to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher net earnings for the period. Cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2010 totaled $790 million as compared to $421 million in fiscal 2009. The increase results primarily from the use of a portion of our available cash balances to purchase US Agency and investment grade bonds. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 totaled $441 million, primarily for remodeling and renovating existing company-operated retail stores, opening new retail stores, and investment in information technology systems. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2010 totaled $346 million as compared to $642 million in fiscal 2009. The change primarily reflects net repayments of commercial paper and short-term borrowings under the credit facility totaling $713 million in fiscal 2009, offset by dividend payments of $171 million and common share repurchases of $286 million in fiscal 2010. 33 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of October 3, 2010, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations(1) Total Less than1 Year 1 - 3Years 3 - 5Years More than5 Years Operating lease obligations(2) $ 4,084.2 $ 718.4 $ 1,279.4 $ 1,006.6 $ 1,079.8 Debt obligations(3) 790.8 34.4 68.8 68.8 618.8 Purchase obligations(4) 613.2 556.7 52.3 4.2 0.0 Other obligations(5) 107.7 1.8 22.3 9.5 74.1 Total $ 5,595.9 $ 1,311.3 $ 1,422.8 $ 1,089.1 $ 1,772.7 (1) Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.

Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement Off-balance sheet arrangements relate to certain guarantees and are detailed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10-K. COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other things. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and can be expected to impact our future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to an umbrella risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the risk to net earnings. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. Additionally, this policy restricts, among other things, the amount of market-based risk we will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity. In general, hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years. 34 Table of Contents The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. Commodity Price Risk We purchase commodity inputs, including coffee, dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. In addition to fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices of our commodity hedges, as of the end of fiscal 2010, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in US dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the US, we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound, euro, and Japanese yen. As a result, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues, inventory purchases, assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of October 3, 2010, Starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases. In addition, we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in Starbucks Japan to minimize foreign currency exposure. Starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes (free standing derivatives), but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables. Increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the US dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables (i.e. “hedged items”) that would occur within the hedging period. The following table summarizes the potential impact to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the US dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): October 3, 2010 Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 46 $ (46 ) $ 13 $ (13 ) Equity Security Price Risk We have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our trading portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the MDCP. A corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of the end of fiscal 2010 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. 35 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk We utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt. At the end of fiscal years 2010 and 2009, we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding. The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): October 3, 2010 Change in Fair Value Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying Rate Debt $ 637 $ (36 ) $ 36 Our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. As of October 3, 2010, our long-term available-for-sale securities included ARS. Please see Note 3 for further information. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for-sale securities. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of the end of fiscal 2010, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We consider our policies on asset impairment, goodwill, stock-based compensation, operating leases, self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Asset Impairment When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment. We first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future cash flows (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss based on the asset’s estimated fair value. For store assets, the fair value of the assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on future store revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. For other assets, we use the valuation approach that is appropriate given the relevant facts and circumstances. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting asset useful lives. Further, our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. As we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. 36 Table of Contents Goodwill Impairment We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value, an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value. We conduct our annual goodwill impairment test for consolidated entities in our third fiscal quarter. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, including estimating future cash flows, and if necessary, the fair value of a reporting units’ assets and liabilities. Further, our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance, and changes in our business strategies. As we periodically reassess our fair value calculations, including estimated future cash flows, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. As a part of Starbucks ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other non-transferrable assets. Under GAAP, when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. As noted above, if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level, we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur. Stock-based Compensation We measure the fair value of stock awards at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the related service period. For stock option awards we use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them (“expected term”), the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock awards expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. Changes in our assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation; however, a 10% change in our critical assumptions including volatility and expected term would not have a material impact for fiscal year 2010. Operating Leases We lease retail stores, roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases. We provide for an estimate of asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term. Estimating AROs involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs. Future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated. In addition, the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which we have operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of ARO expense, as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate. 37 Table of Contents Self Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, and director and officers’ liability insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by Starbucks are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and record a related liability. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits, and our particular facts and circumstances. We believe that our estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The information required by this item is incorporated by reference to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Commodity Prices, Availability and General Risk Conditions” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Financial Risk Management” in Item 7 of this Report. 38 Table of Contents",2023-12-30 18:46:05.929324
829224,SBUX,STARBUCKS CORP,2011,"Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal year ended on October 3, 2010 included 53 weeks with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter. The fiscal years ended on October 2, 2011 and September 27, 2009 both included 52 weeks. Comparable store sales percentages for fiscal 2010 are calculated excluding the 53rd week. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Financial Highlights • Consolidated operating income was $1.7 billion for fiscal 2011 compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2010 and operating margin increased to 14.8% compared to 13.3% in fiscal 2010. The operating margin expansion was driven by increased sales leverage, partially offset by higher commodity costs. Comparable store sales growth at company-operated stores was 8% in fiscal 2011 compared to 7% in fiscal 2010. • EPS for fiscal 2011 was $1.62, compared to EPS of $1.24 reported in fiscal 2010, with the increase driven by the improved sales leverage and certain gains recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011. We recognized a gain from a fair market value adjustment resulting from the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in our joint venture in Switzerland and Austria as well as a gain on the sale of corporate real estate. These gains contributed approximately $0.10 to EPS in fiscal 2011. • Cash flow from operations was $1.6 billion in fiscal 2011 compared to $1.7 billion in fiscal 2010. Capital expenditures were approximately $532 million in fiscal 2011 compared to $440 million in fiscal 2010. Available operating cash flow after capital expenditures during fiscal 2011 was directed at returning approximately $945 million of cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Overview Starbucks results for fiscal 2011 reflect the strength and resiliency of our business model, the global power of our brand and the talent and dedication of our employees. Our business has performed well this year despite significant headwinds from commodity costs and a continuingly challenging consumer environment. Strong global comparable stores sales growth of 8% for the full year (US 8% and International 5%) drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margins and net earnings. This helped mitigate the impact of higher commodity costs, which negatively impacted EPS by approximately $0.20 per share for the year, equivalent to approximately 220 basis points of operating margin. Most of the commodity pressure was related to coffee, with dairy, cocoa, sugar and fuel accounting for the rest. Our US business continued its strong momentum and contributed 69% of total net revenues in fiscal 2011. We saw benefits from a variety of initiatives including our loyalty program, innovative products such as our Starbucks Petites® platform and other new food and beverage options. We also continued to refine our store efficiency efforts, including the rollout of our new point-of-sale and inventory management systems in our company-operated stores. The combination of these efforts resulted in strong comparable store sales of 8%, which translated to an increase in sales leverage, which more than offset the effect of higher commodity costs. Our international portfolio, which contributed 22% of total net revenues in fiscal 2011, continues to improve, with an operating margin of 13% for the year. We continue to leverage the valuable lessons learned from the turnaround of our US business, and continue to make progress on scaling the infrastructure of this segment. We are aggressively pursuing the profitable expansion opportunities that exist outside the US, including disciplined growth and scale in our more mature markets, and faster expansion in key emerging markets like China. Our global consumer products group (“CPG”) represents another important profitable growth opportunity for us. During the second quarter, we successfully transitioned our packaged coffee and tea businesses to an in-house direct model, away from the previous distribution arrangement. This model now gives us total control over the sell-in and distribution to retailers of these products. We also aggressively pursued the opportunities beyond our more 22 Table of Contents traditional store experience to offer consumers new coffee and other products in multiple forms, across new categories, and through diverse channels, leveraging our strong brand and established retail store base. Examples include the ongoing global expansion of our successful Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew product and Starbucks- and Tazo-branded K-Cup® portion packs which were added to the lineup at the start of fiscal 2012. CPG contributed 7% of total net revenues in fiscal 2011. Looking toward the future, we recently announced a reorganization of our leadership structure that took effect at the beginning of fiscal 2012. The new structure will enable us to accelerate our global, multi-brand, multi-channel strategy, and to leverage the talent, experience and expertise resident in our senior leadership team. In this new structure, one president will oversee all operations within each of three distinct regions with responsibility for the performance of company-operated stores, as well as for working with licensed and joint-venture business partners in each market within their respective region. The region president will also be responsible for working with Starbucks Global Consumer Products and Foodservice teams to further develop those businesses and execute against our growth plan within the region. The three new regions will be 1) Americas, inclusive of the US, Canada, and Latin America, 2) China and Asia Pacific, and 3) Europe, Middle East, and Africa, collectively referred to as the EMEA region. Fiscal 2012 — The View Ahead For fiscal year 2012, we expect moderate revenue growth driven by mid single-digit increased comparable store sales, new store openings and strong growth in the CPG business. Licensed stores will comprise between one-half and two-thirds of new store openings in the Americas, EMEA and China and Asia Pacific regions. We expect modest consolidated operating margin and EPS improvement compared to fiscal 2011, given our current revenue expectations, along with ongoing spend related to our expanding CPG in-house direct distribution model and higher commodity costs. We expect increased capital expenditures in fiscal 2012 compared to fiscal 2011, reflecting additional investments in store renovations and in manufacturing capacity. Operating Segment Overview Through the end of fiscal 2011, Starbucks had three reportable operating segments: US, International, and CPG. Our Seattle’s Best Coffee operating segment is reported in “Other,” along with our Digital Ventures business and unallocated corporate expenses that pertain to corporate administrative functions that support our operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. The US and International segments both include company-operated stores and licensed retail stores. Licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues, but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee. The International segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus company-operated stores compared to the US segment; however, the US segment has been operating significantly longer than the International segment and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the more mature US segment has significantly more stores, and higher total revenues than the International segment. Average sales per store are also higher in the US due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels. Further, certain market costs, particularly occupancy costs, are lower in the US segment compared to the average for the International segment, which comprise a more diverse group of operations. As a result of the relative strength of the brand in the US segment, the number of stores, the higher unit volumes, and the lower market costs, the US segment, despite its higher relative percentage of company-operated stores, has a higher operating margin than the less-developed International segment. Starbucks International store base continues to expand and we continue to focus on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets, such as China. Newer 23 Table of Contents international markets require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income. The CPG and Seattle’s Best Coffee segments include packaged coffee and tea and other branded products operations worldwide, as well as the US foodservice business. In prior years through the first several months of fiscal 2011, we sold a selection of Starbucks and Seattle’s Best Coffee branded packaged coffees and Tazo® teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the US and to grocery stores in Canada, the UK and other European countries through a distribution arrangement with Kraft Foods Global, Inc. Kraft managed the distribution, marketing, advertising and promotion of these products as a part of that arrangement. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal 2011, we successfully transitioned these businesses including the marketing, advertising, and promotion of these products, from our previous distribution arrangement with Kraft and began selling these products directly to the grocery and warehouse club stores. Our CPG segment also includes ready-to-drink beverages, which are primarily manufactured and distributed through The North American Coffee Partnership, a joint venture with the Pepsi-Cola Company. The proportionate share of the results of the joint venture is included, on a net basis, in income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings. The US foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broad-line distribution networks. The CPG segment reflects relatively lower revenues, a modest cost structure, and a resulting higher operating margin, compared to the other two reporting segments, which consist primarily of retail stores.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010 Consolidated results of operations (in millions): Revenues Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2,2011 Oct 3,2010 %Change Oct 2,2011 Oct 3,2010 % of Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 9,632.4 $ 8,963.5 7.5 % 82.3 % 83.7 % Licensed stores 1,007.5 875.2 15.1 % 8.6 % 8.2 % CPG, foodservice and other 1,060.5 868.7 22.1 % 9.1 % 8.1 % Total net revenues $ 11,700.4 $ 10,707.4 9.3 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Consolidated net revenues were $11.7 billion for fiscal 2011, an increase of 9%, or $993 million over fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in company-operated retail revenues driven by an 8% increase in global comparable stores sales (contributing approximately $672 million). The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 6% increase in number of transactions (contributing approximately $499 million) and a 2% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $173 million). Also contributing to the increase in total net revenues was favorable foreign currency translation (approximately $126 million) resulting from a weakening of the US dollar relative to foreign currencies and an increase in licensed stores revenues (approximately $106 million). This increase was partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $207 million). 24 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2,2011 Oct 3,2010 Oct 2,2011 Oct 3,2010 % of Total Net Revenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 4,949.3 $ 4,458.6 42.3 % 41.6 % Store operating expenses 3,665.1 3,551.4 31.3 % 33.2 % Other operating expenses 402.0 293.2 3.4 % 2.7 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 523.3 510.4 4.5 % 4.8 % General and administrative expenses 636.1 569.5 5.4 % 5.3 % Restructuring charges 0.0 53.0 0.0 % 0.5 % Total operating expenses 10,175.8 9,436.1 87.0 % 88.1 % Gain on sale of properties 30.2 0.0 0.3 % 0.0 % Income from equity investees 173.7 148.1 1.5 % 1.4 % Operating income $ 1,728.5 $ 1,419.4 14.8 % 13.3 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 38.0 % 39.6 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 70 basis points. The increase was primarily due to higher commodity costs (approximately 220 basis points), mainly driven by increased coffee costs. Partially offsetting this increase was lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 70 basis points), driven by increased sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 190 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage. Other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 70 basis points primarily due to higher expenses to support the direct distribution model for packaged coffee and tea (approximately 40 basis points) and the impairment of certain assets in our Seattle’s Best Coffee business associated with the Borders bankruptcy in April 2011 (approximately 20 basis points). The above changes contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 150 basis points for fiscal 2011. Considering the impact from all line items, the primary drivers for the increase in operating margin for fiscal 2011 were increased sales leverage (approximately 300 basis points), the absence of restructuring charges in the current year (approximately 50 basis points) and the gain on the sale of properties (approximately 30 basis points). These increases were partially offset by higher commodity costs (approximately 220 basis points). 25 Table of Contents Other Income and Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2,2011 Oct 3,2010 Oct 2,2011 Oct 3,2010 % of TotalNet Revenues Operating income $ 1,728.5 $ 1,419.4 14.8 % 13.3 % Interest income and other, net 115.9 50.3 1.0 % 0.5 % Interest expense (33.3 ) (32.7 ) (0.3 )% (0.3 )% Earnings before income taxes 1,811.1 1,437.0 15.5 % 13.4 % Income taxes 563.1 488.7 4.8 % 4.6 % Net earnings including noncontrolling interests 1,248.0 948.3 10.7 % 8.9 % Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 2.3 2.7 0.0 % 0.0 % Net earnings attributable to Starbucks $ 1,245.7 $ 945.6 10.6 % 8.8 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 31.1 % 34.0 % Net interest income and other increased $66 million over the prior year. The increase primarily resulted from the gain recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011 related to our acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in our joint venture operations in Switzerland and Austria (approximately $55 million). Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2011 resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.1% compared to 34.0% for fiscal 2010. The lower rate in fiscal 2011 was primarily due to a benefit from the Switzerland and Austria transaction and to an increase in income in foreign jurisdictions having lower tax rates. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 is expected to be approximately 33%. Operating Segments The following tables summarize our results of operations by segment for fiscal 2011 and 2010 (in millions). United States Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2,2011 Oct 3,2010 Oct 2,2011 Oct 3,2010 As a % of US TotalNet Revenues Total net revenues $ 8,038.0 $ 7,560.4 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 3,093.9 $ 2,906.1 38.5 % 38.4 % Store operating expenses 2,891.3 2,831.9 36.0 % 37.5 % Other operating expenses 62.7 55.6 0.8 % 0.7 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 343.8 350.7 4.3 % 4.6 % General and administrative expenses 83.7 97.8 1.0 % 1.3 % Restructuring charges 0.0 27.2 0.0 % 0.4 % Total operating expenses 6,475.4 6,269.3 80.6 % 82.9 % Operating income $ 1,562.6 $ 1,291.1 19.4 % 17.1 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 38.8 % 40.3 % 26 Table of Contents Revenues Total US net revenues for fiscal 2011 increased 6%, or $478 million. The increase was primarily due to an 8% increase in comparable store sales (contributing approximately $576 million), comprised of a 6% increase in transactions (contributing approximately $420 million), and a 2% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $156 million), partially offset by the absence of the extra week in the current year (approximately $143 million). Operating Expenses Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total US net revenues increased by 10 basis points over the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher commodity costs (approximately 160 basis points) driven by increased coffee costs, mostly offset by increased sales leverage (approximately 130 basis points). Store operating expenses as a percentage of total US net revenues decreased 150 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage. The above changes contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 230 basis points for fiscal 2011. Considering the impact from all line items, the primary drivers for the increase in operating margin were increased sales leverage (approximately 360 basis points) and the absence of restructuring charges in the current year (approximately 40 basis points). These increases were partially offset by higher commodity costs (approximately 160 basis points) driven by increased coffee costs. International Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2,2011 Oct 3,2010 Oct 2,2011 Oct 3,2010 As a % of International Total Net Revenues Total net revenues $ 2,626.1 $ 2,288.8 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 1,259.8 $ 1,078.2 48.0 % 47.1 % Store operating expenses 773.8 719.5 29.5 % 31.4 % Other operating expenses 91.9 85.7 3.5 % 3.7 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 118.5 108.6 4.5 % 4.7 % General and administrative expenses 132.9 126.6 5.1 % 5.5 % Restructuring charges 0.0 25.8 0.0 % 1.1 % Total operating expenses 2,376.9 2,144.4 90.5 % 93.7 % Income from equity investees 100.5 80.8 3.8 % 3.5 % Operating income $ 349.7 $ 225.2 13.3 % 9.8 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 35.4 % 37.2 % Revenues Total International net revenues for fiscal 2011 increased 15%, or $337 million. The increases were primarily driven by foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the US dollar (approximately $126 million), primarily in relation to the Canadian dollar, comparable store sales of 5% (contributing approximately $96 million), and net new company-operated store openings (approximately $57 million). These increases were partially offset by the absence of the extra week in fiscal 2011 (approximately $45 million). The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in transactions (contributing approximately $74 million), and a 1% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $22 million). 27 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total International net revenues increased by 90 basis points compared to the prior year. The increase was primarily due to higher commodity costs (approximately 100 basis points), driven primarily by increased coffee costs. Partially offsetting this increase were lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 40 basis points), primarily due to increased sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total International net revenues decreased 190 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage (approximately 240 basis points) and fewer impairment charges in the current year compared to fiscal 2010 (approximately 80 basis points). These decreases were partially offset by an increase in salaries and benefits expense to support new store openings (approximately 110 basis points). The above changes contributed to an overall increase in operating margin of 350 basis points for fiscal 2011. Considering the impact from all line items, the primary drivers for the increase in operating margin for fiscal 2011 were increased sales leverage (approximately 330 basis points), the absence of restructuring charges in the current year (approximately 110 basis points), fewer impairment charges in the current year compared to fiscal 2010 (approximately 80 basis points), partially offset by increased salaries and benefits (approximately 110 basis points) and higher commodity costs (approximately 100 basis points). Global Consumer Products Group Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2,2011 Oct 3,2010 Oct 2,2011 Oct 3,2010 As a % of CPGTotal Net Revenues Total net revenues $ 860.5 $ 707.4 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 492.5 $ 384.9 57.2 % 54.4 % Other operating expenses 153.9 117.0 17.9 % 16.5 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 2.4 3.7 0.3 % 0.5 % General and administrative expenses 14.3 11.0 1.7 % 1.6 % Total operating expenses 663.1 516.6 77.1 % 73.0 % Income from equity investees 75.6 70.6 8.8 % 10.0 % Operating income $ 273.0 $ 261.4 31.7 % 37.0 % Revenues Total CPG net revenues for fiscal 2011 increased 22%, or $153 million. The increase was primarily due to the benefit of recognizing full revenue from packaged coffee and tea sales under the direct distribution model for the majority of the year (approximately $70 million). On March 1, 2011, we successfully transitioned to a direct distribution model from our previous distribution arrangement with Kraft for the sale of packaged Starbucks® and Seattle’s Best Coffee® coffee products in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the US, and to grocery stores in Canada, the UK and other European countries. We successfully transitioned the Tazo® tea business to a direct distribution model in January 2011. Also contributing to the increase were improved revenues from US foodservice (approximately $26 million) and the expanded distribution of Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew in fiscal 2011 (approximately $24 million), partially offset by the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $16 million). Operating Expenses Operating margin decreased 530 basis points over the prior year primarily due to increased commodity costs (approximately 830 basis points), driven by higher coffee costs. Partially offsetting the increase in commodity costs were the benefit of price increases (approximately 200 basis points) and lower marketing expenses for Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew in the current year (approximately 120 basis points). 28 Table of Contents Other Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2,2011 Oct 3,2010 %Change Total net revenues $ 175.8 $ 150.8 16.6 % Cost of sales $ 103.1 $ 89.4 15.3 % Other operating expenses 93.5 34.9 167.9 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 58.6 47.4 23.6 % General and administrative expenses 405.2 334.1 21.3 % Total operating expenses 660.4 505.8 30.6 % Gain on sale of properties 30.2 0.0 nm Loss from equity investee (2.4 ) (3.3 ) (27.3 )% Operating loss $ (456.8 ) $ (358.3 ) 27.5 % Other is comprised of the Seattle’s Best Coffee operating segment, the Digital Ventures business, and expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support our operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. Substantially all net revenues in Other are generated from the Seattle’s Best Coffee operating segment. The increase in revenues for Seattle’s Best Coffee was primarily due to the recognition of a full year of sales to national accounts added in the latter part of fiscal 2010 as well as new accounts added during fiscal 2011(approximately $20 million). This was partially offset by the impact of the closure of the Seattle’s Best Coffee locations in Borders Bookstores. Total operating expenses in fiscal 2011 increased 31%, or $155 million. This increase is the result of an increase of $71 million in general and administrative expenses due to higher corporate expenses to support growth initiatives and higher donations to the Starbucks Foundation. Also contributing was an increase of $59 million in other operating expenses primarily due to the impairment of certain assets in our Seattle’s Best Coffee business associated with the Borders bankruptcy in April 2011 and an increase in marketing expenses. This increase in operating expenses was partially offset by a gain on the sale of corporate real estate in fiscal 2011 (approximately $30 million). RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009 Consolidated results of operations (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 %Change Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 % of Total NetRevenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 8,963.5 $ 8,180.1 9.6 % 83.7 % 83.7 % Licensed stores 875.2 795.0 10.1 % 8.2 % 8.1 % CPG, foodservice and other 868.7 799.5 8.7 % 8.1 % 8.2 % Total net revenues $ 10,707.4 $ 9,774.6 9.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Consolidated net revenues were $10.7 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 9.5% over fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in company-operated retail revenues driven by a 7% increase in global comparable stores sales (contributing approximately $551 million). The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in number of transactions (contributing approximately $298 million) and a 3% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $253 million). Also contributing to the increase in revenues was the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $207 million), foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the US dollar primarily in relation to the Canadian dollar (approximately $101 million), and the effect of consolidating our previous joint venture in France (approximately $87 million). This increase was partially offset by a net decrease of 72 company-operated stores from fiscal 2009 (approximately $119 million). 29 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 % of Total NetRevenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 4,458.6 $ 4,324.9 41.6 % 44.2 % Store operating expenses 3,551.4 3,425.1 33.2 % 35.0 % Other operating expenses 293.2 264.4 2.7 % 2.7 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 510.4 534.7 4.8 % 5.5 % General and administrative expenses 569.5 453.0 5.3 % 4.6 % Restructuring charges 53.0 332.4 0.5 % 3.4 % Total operating expenses 9,436.1 9,334.5 88.1 % 95.5 % Income from equity investees 148.1 121.9 1.4 % 1.2 % Operating income $ 1,419.4 $ 562.0 13.3 % 5.7 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 39.6 % 41.9 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased 260 basis points. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies which contributed to lower food costs (approximately 70 basis points) and lower beverage and paper packaging product costs (approximately 50 basis points). Also contributing to the decrease were lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 80 basis points) primarily due to sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated retail revenues decreased 230 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage from increased revenues. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure in fiscal 2009 and 2008. The restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2010 reflect charges incurred on the previously announced store closures. With the previously-announced store closures essentially complete, we do not expect to report any further restructuring costs related to these activities. Partially offsetting these favorable fluctuations were increased advertising costs included primarily in other operating expenses and higher performance based compensation expenses, which drove the 70 basis point increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues.

The increase was driven by the impact of an accounting gain recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to our acquisition of a controlling interest in our previous joint venture operations in France. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the carrying value of the previously held joint venture interest was adjusted to 30 Table of Contents fair value upon the acquisition of the controlling interest. Also contributing to the increase were favorable fluctuations in unrealized holding gains on our trading securities portfolio of approximately $10 million. This favorability was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (approximately $11 million), which related primarily to the revaluation of certain trade payables and receivables. Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2010 resulted in an effective tax rate of 34.0% compared to 30.1% for fiscal 2009. The lower rate in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the benefits recognized for retroactive tax credits and an audit settlement.

This increase is primarily due to a 7% increase in comparable store sales (contributing approximately $452 million), comprised of a 3% increase in transactions (contributing approximately $222 million), and a 4% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $230 million). Also contributing to the increase in total net revenues was the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $143 million), partially offset by a net decrease of 57 company-operated stores from fiscal 2009 (approximately $125 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased by 330 basis points over the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies which contributed to lower food costs (approximately 90 basis points) and lower beverage and paper packaging product costs (approximately 60 basis points). Also contributing to the decrease were lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 100 basis points) primarily due to sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percent of related retail revenues decreased 250 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio. Restructuring charges in fiscal 2010 decreased $219 million from 2009 due to the completion of our restructuring efforts in the US during fiscal 2010. 31 Table of Contents International Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 As a % of International TotalNet Revenues Total net revenues $ 2,288.8 $ 1,914.3 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 1,078.2 $ 961.3 47.1 % 50.2 % Store operating expenses 719.5 610.0 31.4 % 31.9 % Other operating expenses 85.7 71.2 3.7 % 3.7 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 108.6 102.2 4.7 % 5.3 % General and administrative expenses 126.6 105.0 5.5 % 5.5 % Restructuring charges 25.8 27.0 1.1 % 1.4 % Total operating expenses 2,144.4 1,876.7 93.7 % 98.0 % Income from equity investees 80.8 53.6 3.5 % 2.8 % Operating income $ 225.2 $ 91.2 9.8 % 4.8 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 37.2 % 37.9 % International net revenues increased due to foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the US dollar primarily in relation to the Canadian dollar (approximately $101 million), comparable store sales of 6% (contributing approximately $99 million), the effect of consolidating our previous joint venture in France (approximately $87 million), and the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $45 million). The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in transactions (contributing approximately $78 million), and a 1% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $21 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased by 310 basis points compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower costs for food and beverage components resulting from supply chain efficiencies (approximately 120 basis points). Also contributing to the decrease were lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 120 basis points) primarily due to sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percent of related retail revenues decreased 70 basis points primarily due to reduced impairments in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio. Restructuring charges in fiscal 2010 decreased slightly from 2009 due to the completion of our restructuring efforts internationally by the end of fiscal 2010. 32 Table of Contents Global Consumer Products Group Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 As a % of CPG Total Net Revenues Total net revenues $ 707.4 $ 674.4 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 384.9 $ 350.5 54.4 % 52.0 % Other operating expenses 117.0 95.3 16.5 % 14.1 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 3.7 4.8 0.5 % 0.7 % General and administrative expenses 11.0 8.8 1.6 % 1.3 % Restructuring charges 0.0 1.0 0.0 % 0.1 % Total operating expenses 516.6 460.4 73.0 % 68.3 % Income from equity investees 70.6 67.8 10.0 % 10.1 % Operating income $ 261.4 $ 281.8 37.0 % 41.8 % CPG net revenues increased primarily due to the launch of Starbucks VIA® Ready Brew (approximately $22 million) and the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $16 million).

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Investment Overview Starbucks cash and short-term investments were $2.1 billion and $1.4 billion and as of October 2, 2011 and October 3, 2010, respectively. As of October 2, 2011, approximately $367.5 million of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries. Of our cash held in foreign subsidiaries, $69.5 million is denominated in the US dollar. We actively manage our cash and short-term investments in order to internally fund operating needs domestically and internationally, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our short-term investments consisted predominantly of US Treasury securities, commercial paper, corporate bonds, and US Agency securities. Also included in our short-term investment portfolio are certificates of deposit placed through an account registry service (“CDARS”), with maturities ranging from 91 days to one year, which we began investing into during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2011. The principal amounts of the individual certificates of deposit do not exceed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. Our portfolio of long-term available for sale securities consists predominantly of high investment-grade corporate bonds, diversified among industries and individual issuers, as well as certificates of deposits placed through CDARS with maturities greater than 1 year. We also have investments in auction rate securities (“ARS”), all of which are classified as long-term. ARS totaling $28 million and $41 million were outstanding as of October 2, 2011 and October 3, 2010, respectively. The reduction in ARS was due to $16 million in redemptions during the fiscal year, with all redemptions done at par. While the ongoing auction failures will limit the liquidity of these ARS investments for some period of time, we do not believe this will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, shareholder dividends or other business requirements. Borrowing capacity Starbucks previous $1 billion unsecured credit facility (the “2005 credit facility”) was available through November of 2010, when we replaced the 2005 credit facility with a new $500 million unsecured credit facility (the “2010 credit facility”) with various banks, of which $100 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit. The 2010 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases and is currently set to mature in November 2014. Starbucks has the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. The interest rate for any borrowings under the credit facility, based on Starbucks current ratings and fixed charge coverage ratio, is 1.075% over LIBOR. The specific spread over LIBOR will depend upon 34 Table of Contents our long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies and our fixed charge coverage ratio. As with the 2005 credit facility, the 2010 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of October 2, 2011 and October 3, 2010, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Under Starbucks commercial paper program we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 million, with individual maturities that may vary, but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The program is backstopped by the 2010 credit facility, and the combined borrowing limit is $500 million for the commercial paper program and the credit facility. Starbucks may issue commercial paper from time to time, and the proceeds of the commercial paper financing will be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. The 2005 credit facility was also paired with a commercial paper program whereby we could issue unsecured commercial paper notes, up to a maximum amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion. The commercial paper program was secured by the 2005 credit facility, and the combined borrowing limit was $1 billion for the commercial paper program and the credit facility. During fiscal 2011 and fiscal 2010, there were no borrowings under the credit facilities or commercial paper programs. As of October 2, 2011 and October 3, 2010, a total of $17 million and $15 million in letters of credit were outstanding under the respective revolving credit facility. The $550 million of 10-year 6.25% Senior Notes also require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of October 2, 2011 and October 3, 2010, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. Use of Cash We expect to use our cash and short-term investments, including any potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in our core businesses, including new product innovations and related marketing support, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses. We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and short-term investments both domestically and internationally will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses in those respective markets as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. However, in the event that we need to repatriate all or a portion of our international cash to the US we would be subject to additional US income taxes. We may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our equity method and cost method investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2012 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing company-operated stores; systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure; new company-operated stores; and additional investments in manufacturing capacity. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2012 are expected to be in the range of approximately $800 million to $900 million. During the second quarter of fiscal 2010, we declared our first ever cash dividend to shareholders of $0.10 per share. During the third quarter of fiscal 2010 and each subsequent quarter through the third quarter of fiscal 2011, we declared and paid a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.13 per share totaling $390 million and $171 million paid in fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. In the fourth quarter, we declared a cash dividend of $0.17 per share to be paid on December 2, 2011 with an expected payout of $127 million. During fiscal years 2011 and 2010, we repurchased 16 million and 11 million shares of common stock ($556 million and $286 million, respectively) under share repurchase authorizations. The number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at October 2, 2011 totaled 24 million. 35 Table of Contents Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion for fiscal year 2011, compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal year 2010. The slight decrease was primarily attributable to an increase in inventories, resulting in part from higher coffee prices, partially offset by higher net earnings for the period and an increase in payables, primarily related to green coffee purchases. Cash used by investing activities for fiscal year 2011 totaled $1.0 billion, compared to $790 million for fiscal year 2010. The increase was primarily due to increased purchases of available-for-sale securities and increased capital expenditures for remodeling and renovating existing company-operated stores, opening new retail stores and investments in information technology systems. The increase was partially offset by increased maturities and calls of available-for-sale securities and cash proceeds from the sale of corporate real estate during the year. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal year 2011 totaled $608 million, compared to $346 million for fiscal year 2010. The increase was primarily due to an increase in cash returned to shareholders through dividend payments and common share repurchases in fiscal 2011. The increase was partially offset by increased proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the related excess tax benefits, resulting from more stock option exercises during the period. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of October 2, 2011, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 - 3 3 - 5 More than Contractual Obligations(1) Total Year Years Years 5 Years Operating lease obligations(2) $ 4,057.9 $ 751.2 $ 1,330.6 $ 988.1 $ 988.0 Purchase obligations(3) 1,099.5 1,018.9 74.6 6.0 0.0 Debt obligations(4) 756.3 34.4 68.8 68.8 584.3 Other obligations(5) 125.1 22.3 19.7 11.4 71.7 Total $ 6,038.8 $ 1,826.8 $ 1,493.7 $ 1,074.3 $ 1,644.0 (1) Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments.

(2) Amounts include the direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 94% of total purchase obligations. (4) Debt amounts include principal maturities and scheduled interest payments on our long-term debt. (5) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations, capital lease obligations and hedging instruments. Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement Off-balance sheet arrangements relate to certain guarantees and are detailed in Note 15 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10-K. 36 Table of Contents COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other things. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and can be expected to impact our future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to an umbrella risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the risk to net earnings. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. Additionally, this policy restricts, among other things, the amount of market-based risk we will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity. In general, hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years. The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. Commodity Price Risk We purchase commodity inputs, including coffee, dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. In addition to fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices of our commodity hedges, as of October 2, 2011, and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in US dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the US, we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound, euro, and Japanese yen. As a result, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues, inventory purchases, assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of October 2, 2011, we had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases. In addition, we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in Starbucks Japan to minimize foreign currency exposure. Starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes (free standing derivatives), but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables. Increases or decreases in the fair value of these derivatives are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the US dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables (i.e. “hedged items”) that would occur within the period. 37 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 2, 2011 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the US dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 35 $ (35 ) $ 15 $ (15 ) Equity Security Price Risk We have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our trading portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). A corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of October 2, 2011 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. Interest Rate Risk We utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt. As of October 2, 2011 and October 3, 2010, we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding. The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of October 2, 2011 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): Change in Fair Value Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying Rate Debt $ 648 $ (33 ) $ 33 Our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available-for-sale securities. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of October 2, 2011, and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. 38 Table of Contents We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity: Asset Impairment When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we evaluate long-lived assets for impairment. We first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we measure an impairment loss based on the asset’s estimated fair value. For retail assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on internal projections. Key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth, operating expenses and a discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider a store’s historical performance, local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. These estimates are subjective and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions. For non-retail assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting asset useful lives. Further, our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess long-lived asset impairment loss. For the foreseeable future, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate long-lived asset impairment losses. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. Goodwill Impairment We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if circumstances, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value. The fair value of our reporting units is the price a willing buyer would pay for the reporting unit and is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. Key assumptions used in this calculation include revenue growth, operating expenses and discount rate that we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the reporting unit. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering a reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is calculated using an estimated cost of capital for a retail operator to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates are highly subjective judgments and can be significantly impacted by changes in the business or economic conditions. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, including estimating future cash flows, and if necessary, the fair value of a reporting units’ assets and liabilities. Further, our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance, and changes in our business strategies. 39 Table of Contents As a part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other non-transferrable assets. Under GAAP, when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. As noted above, if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level, we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to assess goodwill impairment loss. For fiscal 2011, we determined the fair value of our reporting units was substantially in excess of their carrying values. Accordingly, we did not recognize any goodwill impairments during the current fiscal year. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to test for impairment losses on goodwill in the foreseeable future. However, as we periodically reassess our fair value calculations, including estimated future cash flows, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. Stock-based Compensation We measure the fair value of stock awards at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the related service period. For stock option awards we use the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them (“expected term”), the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock awards expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. Changes in our assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock-based compensation. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate stock-based compensation expense for the foreseeable future. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to changes in stock-based compensation expense that could be material in the future. For fiscal 2011, a 10% change in our critical assumptions, including volatility and expected term, would have changed stock-based compensation expense by approximately $15 million for fiscal 2011. Operating Leases We lease retail stores, roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases. We provide for an estimate of our asset retirement obligation (“ARO”) at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term. Our estimates of AROs involve assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs. The initial ARO asset and liability represent the present value of the estimated future costs to complete the required work. The ARO asset is depreciated over the same timeframe as the associate leasehold improvements, and the liability is accreted over time. Future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated. We occasionally vacate stores and other locations prior to the expiration of the related lease. For vacated locations with remaining lease commitments, we record an expense for the difference between the present value of our future lease payments and related costs (e.g., real estate taxes and common area maintenance) from the date of closure through the end of the remaining lease term, net of expected future sublease rental income. Key assumptions in our 40 Table of Contents estimate of future cash flows include estimated sublease income and lease termination costs. These estimates are based on historical experience; our analysis of the specific real estate market, including input from independent real estate firms; and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict. Cash flows are discounted using a rate that coincides with the remaining lease term. The liability recorded for location closures contains uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the duration of future vacancy periods, the amount and timing of future settlement payments, and the amount and timing of potential sublease rental income. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to calculate our lease abandonment accrual. For the foreseeable future, we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our lease abandonment accrual. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our key assumptions for our lease abandonment accrual at October 2, 2011, would not have had a significant impact on net earnings for fiscal 2011. Self Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, and director and officers’ liability insurance. Key assumptions used in the estimate of our self insurance reserves include the amount of claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. These liabilities, which are associated with the risks that are retained by Starbucks are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic, exposure and severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Our self-insured liabilities contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the ultimate cost to settle reported claims and claims incurred but not reported at the balance sheet date. Periodically, we review our assumptions to determine the adequacy of our self-insured liabilities. During the past three fiscal years, we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology that we use to calculate our self-insurance liabilities. We do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions that we use to calculate our self-insurance liabilities for the foreseeable future. However, if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions, we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. A 10% change in our self-insurance reserves at October 2, 2011 would have affected net earnings by approximately $13 million in fiscal 2011. Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and record a related liability. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available. 41 Table of Contents Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits, and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established, or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. Litigation Accruals We are involved in various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. Legal and other contingency reserves and related disclosures are based on our assessment of the likelihood of a potential loss and our ability to estimate the loss or range of loss, which includes consultation with outside legal counsel and advisors. We record reserves related to legal matters when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be reasonably estimated. Such assessments are reviewed each period and revised, based on current facts and circumstances and historical experience with similar claims, as necessary. Our disclosures of and accruals for litigation claims, if any, contain uncertainties because management is required to use judgment to estimate the probability of a loss and a range of possible losses related to each claim. Footnote 15 to the consolidated financial statements describes the Company’s legal and other contingent liability matters. As we periodically review our assessments of litigation accruals, we may change our assumptions with respect to loss probabilities and ranges of potential losses. Any changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on our future results of operations. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10-K for a detailed description of recent accounting pronouncements. We do not expect these recently issued accounting pronouncements to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods. Item 7A.
